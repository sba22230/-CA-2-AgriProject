With TAMS approvals still held up for 5,000 farmers, IFA will be making this a priority issue at this today’s Charter of Rights Monitoring Committee in Portlaoise. Leading the IFA delegation to the meeting, IFA Deputy President Richard Kennedy will highlight the frustration farmers feel about delayed approvals.
Richard Kennedy said the frustration among farmers at the failure to honour Charter commitments was clear during his recent IFA Election campaign and TAMS delays are a clear illustration of this. Putting farmer investment plans on hold is adding to the frustration of farmers at this difficult time and the Deputy President called on Minister Coveney to step in and insist that all tranche applications be given approval to proceed.
IFA Rural Development Chairman Joe Brady said it is totally unacceptable that nine months after TAMS II opened approvals have not yet been made to the vast majority of farmers who have applied. Following two tranches of the scheme, and with the third tranche now open, IFA is questioning Minister Coveney’s commitment to the scheme.
Among the urgent concerns IFA will put forward at the Charter meeting today is the fact that many farmers have applied for silage slabs, which must be put down at least six weeks before silage is put in them. Delays are also very worrying for young farmers who are concerned they will miss out on the 60% grant.
