IFA Environment Chairman Thomas Cooney has welcomed the announcement by Environment Minister Denis Naughten of bring centre dates for the recycling of used tyres by farmers.
Thomas Cooney said, “In July IFA secured a commitment from Minister Naughten that he would make available at least €700,000 to support the farming community to sustainably manage old and worn tyres which can no-longer be used to anchor silage pits.”
Since then a lot of work has taken place and the recent announcement of the bring centre dates, is delivery of Minister Naughten’s commitment to IFA.
“The bring centres will begin in Cootehill Mart, Co. Cavan on Saturday 29th September. It is important that farmers have a look around their farm-yards, gather up any used tyres and support this worthwhile initiative” he concluded.
The dates for the waste tyre bring-centres are as follows:



Saturday 29th September
Cootehill Mart, Co. Cavan
9am to 5pm


Tuesday 9th October
New Ross Mart, Co. Wexford
9am to 5pm


Saturday 13th October
Athenry Mart, Co. Galway
9am to 5pm


Saturday 20th October
Gortdrum Mines, Monard
9am to 5pm



This service is only available to farmers and approximately up to 3 tonnes of tyres (330 car tyres) can be recycled for only €45.
