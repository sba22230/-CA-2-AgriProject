IFA Rural Development Chairman, Flor McCarthy has said that qualifying young farmers under TAMS who need planning permission for work and are soon to turn 40 years of age or to exceed the 5 year rule will be given 14 weeks to secure planning permission from the time of application.
At a meeting with the Department of Agriculture in Johnstown Castle last week, Flor McCarthy said this concession was necessary as otherwise some young farmers would not have been eligible for 60% TAMS scheme where planning permission for the investment was required. All other farmers must have planning permission at time of application.
The IFA Rural Development Chairman told the Department that all other TAMS schemes must open without further delay. This includes TAMS for all farmers, Dairy Equipment, Pigs and Poultry, and Organics.
Flor McCarthy raised with the Department the need to include additional items of grant aid including Sheep Fencing, Silage Slabs and Walls, Grain Storage, Underpasses and Slurry and Litter Storage for Grain Farms. Also other issues were raised including costings and steel standard.
In the 2014-2020 RDP, â‚¬395m is allocated for the TAMS scheme. It is vital that the scheme is flexible and that changes are made over the period to ensure that the full allocation is utilised. The investment requirements of Irish farmers must be catered for in the new TAMS so that the industry can meet the challenges ahead he concluded.
