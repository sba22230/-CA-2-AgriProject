IFA Environment Chairman Thomas Cooney has welcomed Environment Minister Denis Naughten’s decision to provide funding for a number of ‘bring’ centres across the country to support the recycling of waste tyres, which are typically used to anchor silage pits.
Thomas Cooney said, “IFA has lobbied for a number of years for the introduction of a take back scheme for waste tyres, which ensures the sustainable management of old and worn tyres that can no-longer be used to anchor silage pits. We are delighted to have secured almost €700,000 in funding and look forward to the current tendering process being concluded and the bring centres commencing.”
Concluding, Thomas Cooney said, “Farmers continue to demonstrate a real willingness to recycle waste streams generated on farms. Each year thousands of tonnes of farm plastics, bale wrap and meal bags are recycled. I am sure that farmers will also support this worthwhile waste tyre initiative and I look forward to working with Minister Naughten to ensure its success.”
