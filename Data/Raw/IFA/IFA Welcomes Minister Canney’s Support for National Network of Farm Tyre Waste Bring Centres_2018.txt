IFA Environment Chairman Thomas Cooney has welcomed the support received from Seán Canney, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, for the national roll-out of a network of farm tyre waste bring centres.
Thomas Cooney said, “Minister Canney attended the successful farm tyre waste bring centre in Athenry last weekend, and saw at first hand the hundreds of farmers who travelled from the region to sustainably manage and recycle old used tyres that are not required anymore to anchor silage pits. He also understood and supported the need for the recycling service to be extended to allow farmers in other counties the opportunity to recycle these old tyres.”
“IFA has sought a meeting with Minister Canney and we look forward to working with him and his officials to build on the good work so far and ensure we all play our part in keeping the countryside clean.”
The next farm tyre waste collection will take place next Saturday in Gortdrum Mines in Monard, Co Tipperary between 9am and 5pm.
