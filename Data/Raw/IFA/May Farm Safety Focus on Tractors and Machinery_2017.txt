The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) will run a month long intensive farm inspection campaign during May focusing on tractor and machinery safety.
Each year nearly half of all farm deaths, and many more serious accidents, are linked to tractors and machinery. To date in 2017 there have been six farm fatalities with four involving tractors or machinery.
In an effort to reduce these accidents inspectors will be encouraging farmers to plan work and have systems in place that minimise risk particularly during silage harvesting.
