IFA Connacht Regional Chairman Padraic Joyce has said there is frustration among farmers and concern for the welfare of livestock as the full details of the transport subsidy for fodder have not yet been released.
Padraic Joyce said the application forms should be made available immediately to allow farmers to make arrangements.
“The Minister gave this commitment when I raised it at the IFA AGM last week. On Wednesday the Department announced some details but we are still waiting for the application forms.”
On the 100km rule to avail of the subsidy of €12 for silage, and €8 for hay and straw, Padraic Joyce said this is too inflexible and will have to be revisited, along with any other aspects that are impractical.
He said the scheme should have the minimum of bureaucracy as this is a busy time of the year on farms.
Padraic Joyce said the IFA believes a meal voucher system would have been the best and most efficient means of providing support, but in the absence of such a scheme, it is vital that the transport subsidy scheme is opened immediately as farmers are under extreme stress and are in dire need of feed for animals.
