IFA Dairy Chairman Stephen Arthur said it’s inexplicable that Minister McConalogue would not acknowledge the inputs crisis on dairy farms.
“If the Minister is serious about supporting farmers during the current crisis, then he cannot overlook some sectors,” he said.
The Silage Support Scheme announced earlier this week is an important first step for the drystock sector, which is under significant pressure to build up feed stocks for next winter.
“We want the Minister to bring forward targeted measures for dairy farmers who need it most,” he said. 
“Some are tied into fixed milk price contracts. Others are locked up with TB or have high borrowings,” he said. 
Stephen Arthur said the scheme could include objective criteria to ensure the payment goes to those who are under the most pressure.
