Éanna Tiernan from Elphin is taking part in the Smart Farming challenge to identify €5,000 in cost savings on his farm, as well as ways to reduce his farm’s climate impact.
Smart Farming is an initiative led by IFA, in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which works with famers to identify ways to improve farm returns and enhance the environment.
Éanna Tiernan and his father Michael have a Charolais Limousin cross weanling-to-forward store farming enterprise, near Elphin in Co. Roscommon. They sell store heifers off the farm each year.
Éanna knows the value of good grassland management, operating a rotational paddock grazing system to ensure better grassland management on the farm.
However, Éanna also knows that further improvements can be made and that is why he is ready to take the Smart Farming challenge, saying, “I heard that Smart Farming can help me to identify cost savings of at least €5,000 and ways to reduce my climate impact by 5-7%.
“To deliver this I have already sent in my fuel, feed and energy bills along with water, soil and silage samples to the Smart Farming team. They are coming to do a farm visit to identify cost savings.
“I hope the savings identified will make a real difference to the bottom line here on the farm. Hopefully these savings will also benefit the environment for the local community and wider catchment too.”
