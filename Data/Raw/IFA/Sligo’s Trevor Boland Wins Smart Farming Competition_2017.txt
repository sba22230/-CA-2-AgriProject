IFA Smart Farming Programme Leader Thomas Cooney has congratulated Trevor Boland from Dromard, Sligo, who was the winner of the 2017 Smart Farming Competition.
Trevor has won a nutrient management plan and lime for his farm worth up to €2,500. He says the prize will make a real difference on his farm: “Lime is the first thing needed on any farm to get the pH right. For me, there is no point in spreading fertilisers unless I have my soil pH right first, I simply won’t get the grass growth and I will be wasting money.
“I will use the €2,500 to get a soils nutrient management plan for the farm and then spread lime on the fields with the lowest pH. This will sort the acidity in the soil and make the nutrients available to grow more grass. It’s a win-win for me, the farm and the environment.”
Free cost-saving study for farms
Thomas Cooney reminded farmers that they can have a free cost-saving study carried out on their farm by participating in Smart Farming 2018.
He said, “You could save up to €5,000 through cost-saving study, which will include an analysis of silage quality and domestic water as well as a carbon navigator and nutrient management plan. All we ask is that you are open to sharing the cost-saving tips you acquire with your discussion group or IFA branch”
