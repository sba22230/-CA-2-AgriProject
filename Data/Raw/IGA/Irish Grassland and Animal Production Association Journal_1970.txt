Some Aspects  of Efficiency  
in Beef Production
Third  Edward  Richards-Orpen  Memorial  Lecture
presented  by
F. J. Harte,  M.Agr.Sc.,  Ph.D.
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
at the
Winter  Meeting  of the Irish Grassland  and Animal  
Production  Association,  November  27, 1970
Joseph  Harte  is Officer-in-Charge  at the Agricultural  Institute ’s 
Animal  Production  Research  Centre  at Grange,  Co. Meath.  He 
was born in Sligo and took his early education  at Summerhill  
College,  Sligo and at the Agricultural  College,  Mountbellew,  Co. 
Galway.  He graduated  from University  College,  Dublin in 1956 
with a First Class Honours  B.Agr.Sc.,  degree. He received  the 
M.Agr.Sc.,  degree  from University  College,  Dublin  in 1957 and 
his Ph.D.  from Trinity  College,  Dublin  in 1966.
In 1960 he spent a period of study with Dr. T. R. Preston  at 
the Rowett  Research  Institute  in Aberdeen  and in 1966-67  he 
studied under Professor  D. G. Armstrong  and Professor  McG.  
Cooper  at Newcastle-on-Tyne  University.  In 1969 he was awarded  
an O.E.E.C.  Fellowship  and studied  beef production  in France  and 
Holland.
Dr. Harte  has published  over 25 scientific  papers  and has written  
extensively  in the farming  press. He has lectured  throughout  the 
country  and at international  meetings  at home and abroad.  His 
research  work is concerned  with efficiency  in beef production  with 
special emphasis  on calf rearing,  breed comparisons  and bull 
beef production.
I would like to thank the Trustees  of the Edward  Richards-  
Orpen Memorial  Trust for asking me to give this, the third  
Edward  Richards-Orpen  Memorial  lecture.  I did not have the 
privilep  of knowing  the late Mr. Edward  Richards-Orpen,  but 
the tributes  paid to him by Dr. Walsh^  in the first lecture  are 
ample evidence  of his great contribution  to Irish Agriculture.
1 he aim in cattle production  should  be to produce  as efficiently  
as possible  cattle which are capable  of yielding  meat which is 
saleable  at the right price. This involves  the correct  use of land,  
labour  and capital.  Land will provide  the main traditional  sources  
of feed, though soon we may find increasing  amounts  of feed 
coming  from other sources.  Typical  e.xamples  are urea and pro­
teins from oil. Feed costs as a proportion  of total costs in cattle  
production  can vary quite considerably  but a figure of 70% is 
probably  a reasonable  estimate.  Therefore  the efficient  conversion  
of feed into liveweight,  or lean meat, is most important.  We have 
for long understood  the term efficiency  in pigs and poultry,  and 
farmers when selecting  stock are putting increasing  emphasis  
on the ability  of these species  to convert  feed efficiently.  It took 
the great work of Preston  and his colleagues  at the Rowett  Re­
search Institute  in Scotland  to emphasise  the importance  of 
efficiency  in beef production.  We must, however,  readily  admit  
that the expression  of efficiency  in terms of feed intake per unit 
of production  in ruminants  is not as simple  as in the monogastrics  
—pigs and poultry.  It is complicated  by the ability  of ruminants  
to utilise roughages  (of varying  quality)  as well as concentrates.
In Ireland  our ability  to grow good grass means  that many of 
our cattle  are born in the spring  and finished  in the autumn,  one, 
two or three years later. This results  in an uneven  distribution  of 
the direct produce  (milk, beef) throughout  the year. Also, the 
inter-dependence  between  dairying  and beef production  in Ireland  
is not common  to all beef producing  countries.  Yet we all realise 
that an efficient  cattle industry  will need to provide  the market  
with a continuous  supply  of meat of consistent  quality  at a com­
petitive  price.
In this lecture  I will discuss  three main aspects  of my work at 
Grange  associated  with biological  efficiency  in beef production.
1. Systems  of calf rearing.
2. Efficiency  of different  breeds  for meat production.
3. Effect of non-castration  in cattle on efficiency  of pro­
duction.
I hope to show that a good calf-rearing  system,  coupled  with 
effects of breed and non-castration  on carcass  composition,  will 
improve  efficiency  and profitability  of beef production.  I also 
hope to show how we can manipulate  our cattle  breeds,  or perhaps
I should  say our cattle of different  growth  potential,  to niaxiinisc 
lean meat production  and, in particular,  to show how the use of 
bulls can increase  lean meat production.
SYSTEMS  OF CALF REARING
Time will not allow a full review of research  work on calf 
rearing  carried  out in this country  and elsewhere.  Many of you 
know tliat for many years after the State was formed  Professor 
E. J. Sheehy  and his colleagues  at University  College,  Dublin,  
particularly  Dr. B. Senior,  contributed  vastly to our knowledge 
on calf rearing^. Their practical  and realistic approach  is 
acknowledged  at both national  and international  level, and much 
of our present  knowledge  on this subject  is due to their pioneering  
work. This work is being continued  at University  College  in 
Professor  Ruane ’s Department  and names like Aherne,  Caffrey,  
Cahill,  L’Estrange  and McAleese^  * among  others,  are well known 
to you. Preston^  starting  at Newcastle  University,  later at the 
Rowett  Research  Institute  and now working  in Cuba, Roy and 
co-workers®  at the National  Institute  for Research  in Dairying,  
Shinfield,  Alder^ and Tayler®  from Hurley,  among  many others,  
have all made very valuable  contributions  to our knowledge  of 
calf rearing  for beef.
Calving  pattern
In discussing  calf rearing  in this country  one must emphasise 
that most of our calves are born in the first half of the year. Of 
the 1.6 million  cows in the National  Herd®,  88% calve between  
January  and May inclusive^®.  The remaining  12% of our cows  
calve in a fairly scattered  pattern  over the second  half of the year 
but mainly  in autumn.  This leaves  us with two distinct  calf rearing  
situations; —
(a) Spring rearing; where there is whole milk (relatively  
cheap), skim milk, milk replacers,  meals and grass availalde.
(b) Autumn  rearing;  where there is little or no grass or skim 
milk and only milk replacers  and relatively  expensive  whole milk 
and meals available.
There  is unfortunately  no one system  of calf rearing  that I can 
recommend  for either autumn  or spring rearing.  Obviously  much  
will depend  on the cost of the various  feed ingredients  and their  
availability  to individual  farmers.  For instance  the Government  
policy of insisting  on a minimum  inclusion  of butterfat  in milk 
replacers  caused  an immediate  increase  in prices even though  the 
price of skim milk (one of the main constituents  of replacers)  was 
falling.
Feeding  value of various  foods
I will now discuss  the value of the various  feeds available  for 
calf rearing.  It is, of course,  well known  to you that for at least 
the first 3 to 5 weeks of the calf’s life the feed must be given 
in liquid form and it must be milk, milk products  or a diet at 
least almost  as good as milk in nutritional  value. The importance  
of feeding  colostrum  within  the first few hours after birth is now 
v/ell established^'.
Milk replacers
I’he following  table shows the performance  of calves fed whole 
milk and milk replacers'®.
TABLE  1. Liveweight  (kg) of calves  fed 
or whole  milk and skim milk.different  milk
Liveweight  atreplacers
Days of age 28 56 84
Milk replacer  A 44.4 61.5 77.3

Milk replacer  C
Whole  milk to 28 days44.9 61.9 75.9
followed  by skim milk 50.0 67.7 82.7
These milk replacers  are based almost  completely  on dried skim  
milk products  plus 10-20%  animal  fat (tallow  and/or  butterfat).  
From this and other experiments  at Grange  we estimate  that 4 
litres of whole milk is equivalent  in feeding  value to 0.,5 kg of 
milk replacer  approximately.  If milk replacer  costs 16p per kg, 
this suggests  that you should  use it in preference  to whole  milk if 
you are getting more than a clear lip per 5.0 litres. Costs of 
heating  water, mixing facilities  and labour must be taken into 
account  when costing  milk replacers.  If you are using whole  milk 
you would, of course, need to have a ready supply available.  
However,  to date, at any rate, most calf rearing  farms also have  
cows.'®
Milk replacers  have the great advantage  that they are con­
centrated  and are easily stored. They obviously  have a most  
important  part to play in autumn  calf rearing  where  either  whole 
milk is not available  or is being produced  and sold at a relatively  
high price. Certainly  in veal units where  the emphasis  is on high 
calf gains, milk replacers  have an advantage  over whole milk in 
that the dry matter  content  of the liquid being fed can be in­
creased;  this allows for an increased  intake of dry matter and
reduces costs of heating  water and feeding.  Because  of their  
convenience  in feeding  systems  and likely improved  quality  due to 
better formulation,  there seems little doubt that milk replacers  
have a bright  future  in calf rearing,  particularly  when milk prices 
increase.
Skim milk feeding
The Institute ’s Farm Management  Survey^"  shows that 77%  
of the skim milk returned  to farmers  is used for calf feeding  and 
in 1969 it was estimated  that farmers  u.sed 955 million  litres in 
this way. Many nutritionists  would suggest  that a considerably  
greater  proportion  should be fed to pigs but that is one of the 
privileges  of being a farmer  — he can still decide for himself.  
What then is the values  of skim milk in calf rearing?  Calf per­
formance  will be hopelessly  low if calves are fed on skim milk 
before 3-4 weeks of age. However,  there are a number  of dr\- 
fat/protein  supplements  coming  on the market now, and when 
added to skim milk these are giving most promising  results,  even 
in early life. After 4 to 5 weeks of age calves will do quite well 
on skim milk, provided  they have grass  and/or  meals'®.
Our results show that 5 litres of skim milk are equivalent  or 
somewhat  superior  to 0.5 kg of rolled barley  from approximatelv  
6-8 weeks of age. These results were obtained  with calves at 
pasture.  They are not likely to be very' different  in indoor  rearing  
systems  provided  the necessary  vitamins  are added  to the feed and 
the calv'es  are fed either  high quality  hay or silage.  If, for instance  
rolled barley is worth 3p per kg (or £1.50 per cwt.) then skim 
milk can be fed if you have it or can buy it cheaper  than Ip per 
5 litres. It is really up to the farmer  and his advisor  to work 
this one out.
When,  however,  one is feeding  a food of low dry matter  content  
such as skim milk there is an important  aspect of management  
to remember.  Suppose  a farmer  has 50 calves and he decides  
to feed 1 kg of rolled barley/head/day,  this means  taking  out to 
the held 50 kg of rolled  barley.  An equivalent  of skim milk would  
weigh 450 kg (i.e. 50x9) plus containers.  In the past we have 
stressed  the importance  of good grass in calf rearing ” and without  
it good calf performance  at pasture  is almost impossible  unless  
meals are fed. Having  good grass available  means some form of 
rotational  grazing,  resulting  in the calves being a considerable  
distance  away from the yard at least for part of the grazing  season.  
Therefore  good grassland  management  and skim milk feeding  do 
not always  go together,  particularly  in big units because  of the 
transport  costs involved.
As you move up in scale of operation  you can see that a low 
dry matter  food is at a serious  disadvantage  and here is a case 
where  what is the cheapest  food may not be the most economical  
one to use. Present  day costs of drying  skim milk would not leave  
it competitive  with meals if used in the dried or reconstituted  
form.
Meal feeding
Calves  should be offered  meals from 4 days of age. It will be 
appreciated  that calves could live on meals only from 4 days of 
age® However,  liveweight  gains are not just adequate
for present day production  requirements  if calves are weaned  
at this early age. Nevertheless,  you must remember  that meals  
cost about one-third  of the price of whole milk on a dry matter  
basis. So unless  you have cheap  skim milk you should  use as much 
meals  as the calf can digest.
In my opinion,  taking the present  inputs and returns  in cattle  
production,  calves should be off milk (except  low-priced  skim)  
by 8 weeks  of age.
Multiple  sucklings
In many  areas in this country  prices  for whole  milk are relatively  
low. From what I have said earlier about the relative  values of 
whole milk and milk replacer  you will appreciate  it would be 
more economical  in many cases to feed whole milk, produced  on 
the farm, rather  than use milk replacers.  Would  it be better then 
to feed the whole milk directly  from the cow rather than milk 
it and then feed it to the calf? It does not seem logical to milk 
a cow and then feed that milk to the calves,  particularly  when the 
cow will give more milk when multiple  suckled  than when she is 
machine  milked.  Of course  there is still a considerable  amount  of 
work to be done on the effects of plane of nutrition  in the calf 
stage on performance  later in life'" but in general  multiple
suckling  tends to provide  the calf with a higher  plane of nutrition  
than bucket  rearing  systems.
As a result of five years research  work we set up a system  at 
Orange,  details of which I described  to this -Association  at a 
previous  meeting'®  2' and elsewhere^^  You will recall we used 
eight cows which suckled 48 calves (i.e. 6 calves each) from 
March to November,  and 8 hectares  provided  the grazing  and 
silage for the cows and calves for the whole year. Table 2 shows  
the calf performances  from our multiple  suckling  unit during  the 
past 4 years.

The calves were born in mid-March  each year. In the first 
three years the calves used were Hereford  X Shorthorns  and all 
were castrated.  In 1970 half the calves were pure Friesians,  the 
other half were Hereford  X Shorthorns  and half of each group  
was castrated.  The results  were quite consistent  from year to year. 
The weight range of calves was narrow  and the mortality  was 
never  more than 2%.
Economic  returns  per acre are always  difficult  to estimate  be­
cause of the controversy  of incoming  and outgoing  prices and of 
course  gross margins.  My estimates  for costs and returns  in our 
multiple  suckling  unit are given in Table  3.

A. Conway,  one of my colleagues  from our Economics  Section^ ’
has calculated  the effect of buying and selling prices on gross  
margins  per acre. His results  are sliown  in Table  4 assuming  vari­
able costs per acre of £47. It is obvious  that the differential  be­
tween buying  and selling  prices  has a very important  influence  on 
the gross margin.  This differential  has been fairly stable over the 
years particularly  if you take into account  changes  in money 
values,  when we were paying  £10 for a calf we were getting  about  
£50 to £60 for it at 2 years and now when we pay £30 per calf 
we get £80 to £100  at 2years.

The gross margins  are certainly  attractive  and the labour  inputs  
are not usually high. The capital investment  in livestock  per 
acre is probably  not too different  from that for dairying  and of 
course there is less equipment  involved.  The livestock  investment  
per acre is of course lower than in an intensive  calf unit on its 
own where  in general  weight  gains per calf will be lower. I have  
explained  on a previous  occasion^^  that grassland  management  is 
simpler  in a multiple  suckling  unit than in an intensive  calf unit 
because  the cows in the former  graze the pasture  after the calves  
resulting  in high quality  grass being available  to the calves in 
the next round  of the rotation.
It is important  here to emphasise  that in all our suckling  units  
at Grange  the health of the calves was better than in the non­
suckling  units. Mortality  in calf rearing  can vary enormously  but 
it appears  from our work to date that calf mortality,  which is 
normally  about 4-5% in bucket  rearing  systems,  is 1-2% or less 
in the multiple  suckling  systems.  Incidentally  one obvious  source 
of calves  for multiple  suckling  is the once bred heifer  system  which  
I refer to later.
Environment
Very little useful research  work has been done on environment
9
in relation  to calf rearing  in this country.  Let me simply  state that 
our two main disease problems  in calf production  are virus 
pneumonia  and salmonellosis.  The Veterinary  Research  Labor ­
atory, Abbotstown,  is now carrying  out some trials at Grange  
on the possible  use of vaccines  to control  salmonella.  While we 
wait the results  of these investigations  we feel that the best way 
to reduce  the incidences  of these diseases  is to rear the calves  out 
of doors,  or at least in very open environments.
The organisation  of calf feeding
With good farm workers  getting scarce and expensive,  the 
organisation  and management  of calf units are very important  
and I covered  aspects  of this work previouslyI  have already-  
indicated  that in some cases the direct value of a feeding  stuff 
like skim milk could be counter  balanced  by the costs of feeding.
Once-a-day  feeding
Our experiments  show that if milk is fed at less tlian 7 litres  
per head per day there is no point in feeding  twice daily after  
10-14 days of age. There is also room for reducing  weekend 
work^^.  In an 80-100  calf unit it will take a man at least 2-3 hours 
to prepare,  feed and wash up twice daily. This means  if you fed 
once daily you will obviously  save a considerable  amount  of time.  
Furthermore  there is the important  social aspects  where the farm  
worker  or farmer  would not be committed  to feeding  his calves  
on Saturday  and Sunday  afternoons.
Once-a-day  milking  in the later part of the lactation  in the 
multiple  suckling  systems  which I have discussed  should be con­
sidered. John Walsh at Moorepark  has shown that once-daily  
milking  in later lactation  reduced  daily yield by about 40%.  
This is not a very big reduction  since the yield at that stage of 
the lactation  is low.
The possibility  of increasing  the dry matter  in the liquid feed 
is also an important  way of improving  efficiency  in organisation  
of feeding.  I would suggest  however  that this should not be at­
tempted  before  3 weeks  of age.
The calfeteria
The calfeteria  system is a very useful way of feeding  calves.  
It consists  of a steel ring which  holds a series of teats from which 
tubes drop into a creamery  can, and each calf suckles  its milk 
through  an individual  teat “‘. This is a very suitable  way of feeding 
10 or more calves  of the same age. Obviously  if calves  vary con­
siderably  in age then the older calves tend to get too much of the 
total milk allowance  to the detriment  of the younger  calves. As
10
I indicated  earlier  it is not good economics  to feed milk to calves  
once they have reached  the age when they can utilise meals  
satisfactorily.
From an organisation  point of view let me remind  you that 
suckling  32 calves on 8 cows simultaneously,  as described  in the 
multiple  suckling  system, is attractive.  It is a fine “automatic  
milking  unit” where  the cows need no stimulation.
What then is the best way for a man to rear his calves?  As I 
see it if he is a small farmer  with 5-10 cows particularly  in an 
area where  the creamery  milk price is low then he should  multiple  
suckle.  It is an efficient  and economical  method  of rearing  calves 
in areas where milk prices are low. Other factors  in favour  of 
multiple  suckling  (as against  bucket  rearing  or whole milk) are 
the health  of calves,  and the fact that cows suckled  out fully twice 
daily can give up to 15% more milk than similarly  fed cows  
machine  milked twice daily^'.I  believe  that the specialised  dairy  
man will not want to rear calves, and consequently  there is 
always  likely to be a ready supply  of calves  for multiple  suckling.
The dairy farmer  who rears his own calves  and who has milking  
equipment  installed  may decide  that he wants to put all his cows  
through  the plant. But he should  consider  using those cows that 
are on their last lactation  for multiple  suckling.  The problems  of 
getting  them in calf without  a bull do not arise. Much will also 
depend  on the price he receives  for whole milk and skim milk 
and this can vary considerably  throughout  the country.  This 
farmer  may decide  to use milk replacer  or to feed whole  milk and 
meals  at pasture  or perhaps  skim milk instead  of meals.
The farmer producing  liquid milk will almost certainly  use 
milk replacer  particularly  in autumn  and winter  which will be 
his main calving  time. The ability  of meals  to substitute  milk must  
always  be remembered  particularly  when milk prices  are relatively  
high and in general  calves should  be fully off milk replacer  and 
on to meals by eight weeks.  Veal producers,  because  of the special  
product  required,  must use milk replacers.  Of course  any farmer  
who does not discuss  his calf rearing  with his Agricultural  Adviser 
is really not using intelligently  a service  which  is available  to him.
Effect  of breed and castration  on efficient  meat production
I have talked  on some aspects  of calf rearing  to this association  
previously^^ and have discussed  the finishing  of cattle. Now  
I wish to turn to efficiency  of lean meat production.  What are 
the main factors  which will influence  the yield of lean meat per 
animal?  I believe  that maximising  yield of acceptable  meat per 
animal  is going to be extremely  important  in the future.  Because 
of problems  of selling  dairy products,  it appears  that the day is
11
fast approaching  when the dairy industry  will no longer  be giving  
us calves  as a by-product  for the beef industry.  Indeed  the returns  
from calf sales are now a most important  part of the total returns  
for a dairy herd. If cows have to be kept just to produce  calves  
alone obviously  the yield of lean meat per animal  is going to be 
of critical  importance.  Assuming  that the calf price is an indic ­
ation of the costs of producing  a new-born  calf (although  this is 
not always  the case) then Table  5 is of interest.  Carroll  in a paper  
to this Association  stressed  this point”.
TABLE  5. Spread  of calf prices  on slaughter  weights.
Calf price Charge  (p)on carcass at (kg)*
(£ per head) 100 200 400
10 10 5 2.5
20 20 10 5.0
30 30 15 7.5
40 40 20 10
*new  pence  per kg carcass
One hundred  kg is approximately  the carcass  weight  of a veal 
animal  while  very many  of the cattle killed in France  have carcass  
weights  as high or higher  than 400 kg. The cost of slaughtering  
a small as against  a big animal is also worth thinking  about.  
Preston and Willis^®  in an excellent  book on beef production,  
just published,  rightly stressed  the importance  of the biological  
efficiency  of the animal and therefore  come down in favour  of 
killing animals  young.  We must however  also take into account  
the feed costs of bringing  the animal  into this world,  i.e. maternal  
costs. Obviously,  on the other hand, no animal  should be kept 
to an old age as its efficiency  will be uneconomical  and its meat  
quality will not be acceptable.  The two approaches  must be 
“married ” as regards  optimum  yield of edible meat per animal.
Different  feed ingredients  and level of feeding^®  will, of
course,  influence  carcass  composition  but at this stage I want to 
talk about the effect of breed and castration  on performance  of 
lean meat production.
EFFECTS  OF BREED  ON EFFICIENCY  OF MEAT  
PRODUCTION
Growth  rate
Let us look now at some of the results  obtained  when we com­
pared the performances  of different  breeds and crosses  of cattle
12
for beef production.  There was little or no difference  in growth  
rate between  Hereford  X Shorthorns  and pure Friesians.  Aberdeen  
Angus-cross  Shorthorns  were slower growing  than either of the 
other two types. The results of these experiments  have already  
been published^**  In another  series of experiments®^  the
crosses  of Friesian,  Hereford  and Charolais  bulls on Friesian  and 
Shorthorn  cows were compared.  In the first one of these experi ­
ments pure Friesians,  Hereford  X Shorthorns  and Charolais  X 
Shorthorns  were compared.  The Charolais  bulls used in this experi ­
ment were imported  from the U.S. In the second  experiment  the 
Charolais  bulls used were imported  from France,  and Hereford  
X Shorthorns,  Charolais  X Shorthorns  and Hereford  X Friesians  
were compared.  In both of these experiments  there was no signifi ­
cant difference  between  the various  breeds  and crosses  in growth  
rate. The tests were carried  out over an average  of 445 days and 
the mean growth  rate was 0.75 kg per day and ranged  from 0.73 
to 0.80 kg per day. Vial®**,  in a large-scale  experiment  comparing  
nine different  breeds or crosses, showed that there was little 
difference  between Charolais  crosses and pure Friesians,  the 
Charolais  in fact having the slower growth.  The results of his 
experiment  are not fully analysed.  The Meat and Livestock  Com ­
mission  in England  reported  that the Charolais  crosses  performed  
.somewhat  better than the Hereford  crosses but it must be re­
membered  that their results  were from suckler  herds where  a full 
expression  of growth  performance  was allowed.
Feed efficiency
Table 6 shows the feed consumed  per kg of liveweight  gain in 
the Charolais  series of experiments.  All the animals  were fed 
individually.  These results are not fully analysed®®  but there  
appears  to be no major difference  between  breeds  and crosses  as 
regards  feed efficiency  per unit of gain.

The feed measurements  in experiment  1 were taken from 200 
to 635 days and in experiment  2 from 150 to 603 days.
Carcass  yield
Dressing  out percentage  is taken here as the number  of units  
of carcass per 100 units of liveweight  at slaughter.  When we 
slaughtered  Friesians  at 545 kg, Hereford  X Shorthorns  at 500 kg 
and Aberdeen  Angus  X Shorthorns  at 455 kg we found no differ ­
ence in dressing  out percentage  but when these breeds  were killed  
at the same liveweight  the Friesians  killed out worst''".  Table 7 
shows the carcass  weights  and the dressing  out prercentages  in 
the experiments  when  Charolais  crosses  were used.

Friesians 514 54.2
The Friesians  killed out less than the cross-breeds  but this is 
likely to occur only when the slaughter  weights  are low. Our 
other experiments  showed that when Friesians  were allowed  to 
go to fairly heavy  weights  they kill out just as well as beef crosses'"'.  
Differences  in dressing  out percentage  between  the two experi ­
ments (Table  7) serve to stress the weakness  of comparing  dressing 
out percentage  between  experiments.  In experiment  1 the figures  
are based on full body weights  while in the other experiment  
carcass  weights  were expressed  as a percentage  of a fasted body 
weight.  These results  serve a warning  to those who tend to com­
pare breeds without  determining  the circumstances  under which  
dressing  out figures  were calculated.  The results  also help to ex­
plain why some farmers  get different  dressing  out figures when 
they bring their cattle to the factory.  Transport  conditions,  dis­
tance and type of feed will all influence  dressing  out percentage  
because  of their  effects  on gut fill.
Carcass  shape
Considerable  importance  has been put on the shape of the live 
animal  in the past and it is reasonable  to assume  that the shape
14
of the live animal  would be reflected  in carcass  shape. Carcass  
shape in turn might  be expected  to be related  to the proportion  of 
high-priced  cuts in the carcass.  Whether  there is in fact much  
relationship  between  these various  factors is now open to great  
doubt^*.  Obviously  the really important  thing is the proportion  of 
total carcass  lean meat occurring  in the high-priced  cuts. There  
IS considerable  variation  in defining  what is a high-priced  cut. 
Where we used a slightly  modified  version  of tlie I^ondon  and 
a slightly  modified  version  of the American  box beef method  of 
carcass cutting^®.  Only in experiments  where the same method  
of cutting  is used is it valid to compare  the results  from different  
experiments.  It is not valid to compare  breeds which have been 
cut in different  ways but unfortunately  many people  tend to do 
this.
The percentage  of total carcass lean meat occurring  in the 
high-priced  cuts was 50.2, 48.7 and 50.5 in one experiment  and 
it was 48.8, 47.7 and 47.9 in another  experiments^  for Friesians, 
Hereford  X Shorthorns  and Aberdeen  Angus X Shorthorns  re­
spectively.  In the second experiment,  particularly,  the Friesians  
appeared  to have poor confirmation  compared  to the Alierdecn  
Angus  crosses,  yet there was no major  difference  in the proportion  
of high-priced  cuts, the advantage,  if any being in favour of 
Friesians.  Table 8 shows the proportion  of carca.ss lean meat  
occurring  in the high-priced  cuts in the series of e.xperiinents 
involving  Charolais  crossesS®.

There was in fact no major difference  between  any of the 
breeds  or crosses  in this respect.
Carcass  composition
In our first experiments^  with Friesians,  Hereford  X Shorthorns  
and Aberdeen  Angus  X Shorthorns,  the figures  for the percentages  
of lean meat in the carcass  were 71.1, 65.8 and 67.0 respectively. 
In the second  experiment  using the same breeds  and crosses*^  the 
figures were 70.7, 67.7 and 65.3 and in that experiment  the
15
Friesians  would not be regarded  as finished  by present-day  com­
mercial  standards.  The Friesians  had therefore  significantly  more 
lean meat in their carcasses  than beef crosses  in the first experi ­
ment, and in the second exp)eriment,  even though they had a 
lower dressing  out percentage  (2 units),  they had more lean meat  
per animal  than the Aberdeen  Angus  crosses  and similar  amounts  
to the Hereford  crosses  (Table  9).

In the group of experiments  involving  Charolais  crosses the 
figures for carcass  composition  are given in Tables 10 and 11. 
The method  of carcass  analysis  used in the Charolais  series of 
experiments  was different  from that used in the earlier experi ­
ments involving  Friesians,  Hereford  X Shorthorns  and Aberdeen  
Angus X Shorthorns ’^. Comparisons  therefore  are only valid 
within  the experimental  series.

The carcass  weights  of H. X Sh. H. X Fr. and Ch. X Sh. were 
290, 285 and 293 respectively.
The Charolais  crosses  had one percentage  unit more lean meat  
than the pure Friesians  and over 4 percentage  units more than 
the Hereford  X Shorthorns  in the first experiment  (Table  10). 
1 here is, however  no evidence  of the Charolais  crosses  having  this 
extra lean in the high-priced  cuts (Table 8). This experiment  
suggests  that using a Hereford  sire on Friesians  reduces  the lean 
meat content  (Table  11) of the carcasses  of the progeny.
Table 7 shows that the pure Friesians  had lower dressing-out  
figures (3 units) than the H. X sh. or Ch. X Shorthorns.  The 
important  thing is yield of lean meat per animal  and this is set 
out in Table  12.

Fr. 514 54.2 190.6
You can see that the low dressing  out percentage  in the Friesians  
compared  to the Hereford  X Shorthorns  is counter-balanced  by 
the higher lean meat content  of the Friesian  carcasses.  The 
Charolais  cros.ses had a significantly  higher yield of meat per 
unit of liveweight  than the Friesians  and Hereford  X Shorthorns  
This is likely to be impwrtant  when transport,  killing and pro­
duction  costs are taken into account.  However,  the differences  
between  Charolais  crosses and Friesians  are likelv to be much  
less (if they exist at all) in situations  where Friesians  are taken  
to heavier  weights.
Meat:  Bone ratios
Too much emphasis  on meat to bone ratio can be misleading. 
This can be seen clearly  from the results of one of our experi ­
ments®^  on breed  comparisons  (Table  13).
TABLE  13. Carcass  weights,  yield of meat, fat and bone (kg) 
and meat to bone ratios.

The Friesians  had an inferior  meat to bone ratio compared  
to the Hereford  crosses.  Both groups  produced  similar  yields of 
meat (189 kg) although  the Friesans  had lighter  carcasses.  Con- 
.sequently,  comparing  meat; hone ratios in different  e.xperiments  
is a waste  of time unless  exactly  the same measurements  are used.
In summary  tlien it can be stated  that Charolais  cros.ses  did not 
grow significantly  faster than the Friesians  or Hereford  crosses.  
They did have a better killing  out percentage  than the Friesians. 
This might  not happen  if all animals  were allowed  to go to heavier  
weights —something  which I feel will be essential  in the future,  
though at present  it does leave the Charolais  crosses with this 
advantage.  The Charolais  crosses  had advantages  over the Here ­
ford crosses  and to a considerably  lesser extent  over the Friesians  
as regards  absolute  yield of lean meat and percentage  yield of 
lean meat in the carcasses.  However  there is no evidence  that 
this extra lean meat occurred  in the high-priced  cuts. The Char ­
olais also has the advantage  of being a ‘beef ’ breed and to date 
at least that seems to be important  in the store trade which does 
not lack its .share  of traditionalism  and conservatism.
In this country  there is obviously  a place for the various  breeds. 
The pure Friesian  has the big advantage  that it is dual-purpose  
and also that a cross-breeding  programme  is not needed  to ensure 
its survival.  A real dual-purpose  breed has the further  advantage  
that greater selection  for milk potential  is fxissible.  There are 
simply more females  to select from and I understand  from my 
colleague  Cunningham® ’ that there is no antagonism  between  
selecting  for milk and beef simultaneously.  To maintain  any 
advantage  the Charolais  may have over the Friesian  it will be 
necessary  to dispel  any fears that are associated  with the Charolais  
cross as regards  calving  difficulties.  I understand  however  this is 
being investigated  in France  and of course the Milk Marketing  
Board in England  are also looking  at this problem.  I have only 
discussed  a few of the breeds  available  to us. The importation  of 
the fast growing  South Devon,  and I hope many other breeds, 
will soon present  us with an opportunity  to test the lean meat  
production  potential  of these  various  breeds.
EFFECT  OF CASTRATION  ON PERFORMANCE
Some aspects  of our work on effect of castration  of cattle on 
performance  has been submitted  to a previous  meeting  of this 
Association®*,  and the whole subject of meat production  from 
entire male animals  was discussed  at a recent conference  in 
Bristol®*.  Our work at Grange®*  ®® ®* ®* '‘® agrees  quite well
with world literature  on the subject  and is summarised  as follows:
18
1. Bulls grow  8-15%  faster  than steers.
2. Bulls convert food into liveweight,  carcass or lean meat  
more efficiently  than steers.
3. Bulls yield more lean meat and less fat per unit of body  
weight  than steers.
Table 14 shows the difference  in growth rate l)etween  bulbs 
and steers,  slaughtered  at either  17 or 23 months  of age.
T.4BLE  14. Liveweight  performances  (kg) and differences  be­
tween groups of bulls and steers slaughtered  at

% difference  in favour  of bulls 17.5 17.4
The final liveweight  of the bulls and steers slaughtered  at 23 
months  of age was 613 and 552 kg respectively  (Table 14) a 
difference  of 61 kg (nearly li cwt.). All the animals  were fed 
similarly.  In effect 20 animals  kept under these circumstances  as 
bulls would yield over 20 cwt more liveweight  than if they were 
steers— equivalent  to almost  2 extra  bullocks.
Feed efficiency
Bulls are more efficient  than steers in converting  feed into 
liveweight  or lean meat (Table  15).

All animals  were slaughtered  at 13 months.
Bulls grow more efficiently  than steers because  firstly they grow 
faster (they use less of their food for maintenance  per unit of 
gain) and secondly  because  they lay down less fat in their car­
casses than steers. It is well known  that it is 6 to 7 times more 
expensive,  in terms of energy,  to lay down fatty rather  than lean 
tissue.
Breed effect
I would like to emphasise  at this stage that all this work was 
done on Friesian  cattle. We have now some evidence,  coming  to 
hand, which suggests  that growth  in favour  of bulls may not be 
as great in Hereford  X Shorthorns  as in the Friesians.  Further  
work is now in progress  at Grange  on this subject.
Carcass  yield
Steers  tended  to have somewhat  better  dressing  out figures  than 
bulls (Table  16) except  in one of the groups  in the 1964 experi ­
ment where the bulls were much heavier  than the steers at 
slaughter.  There is considerable  evidence  to show that dressing 
out percentage  improves  as liveweight  increases ’*®.

However,  most of these differences  are due to the extra yield  
of kidney  and channel  fat in the steers^^  and kidney  and channel  
fat is a poor seller.
When we cut the bull and steer carcasses  into the various  
commercial  cuts we found that bulls have heavier  chucks (neck 
region,  a cheap  cut) than steers.

Bulls have however  projxjrtionately  heavier  rounds  than steers 
as shown in Table 18'“. The animals  in groups  A and B were  
slaughtered  at 17 months  and these in groups C and D at 23 
months  of age.
Carcass  composition
Table 19 shows the percentage  yield of the 3 components  of 
the carcass ’*. In this instance  “meat ” is taken as the carcass  less 
subcutaneous  fat and bone. Fat is taken as subcutaneous  fat plus 
kidney  and channel  fat.

You will note that the bulls and steers were killed at either  
17 or 23 months  of age. The percentage  meat content  of the car­
casses from the older animals  (71.8%  of carcass)  is particularly  
significant.  This suggests  that there was no tendency  for the 
bulls to grow fatter with age compared  with similarly  managed  
steers.

The ability  of bulls to yield ‘ meat ”
Table 20 compares  the ability  of bulls to produce  “meat ” with  
that of similarly  fed steers.
The figure  of 28 per cent more meat than in a comparable  steer  
is especially  significant.  It is particularly  worth emphasising  here 
again that this extra “meat ” is obtained  with almost no extra  
food costs. There  remains  the question  of the quality  of bull meat  
compared  with steers. At present  the Institute ’s Meat Research  
Department  is doing  some work in this field. The World  literature  
comparing  bull and steer meat suggests  that there is little differ ­
ence in meat quality  with some very slight evidence  in favour  of 
steers^®
Behaviour  of bulls
I have discussed  this at a previous  meeting  of this Association. 
It is indeed diflBcult  to evaluate  scientifically  whether  bulls are 
more difficult  to manage  than steers. Certainly  the average  in­
dividual ’s view of bulls is biassed  by the behaviour  of stock bulls  
— but do let us remember  that this animal  is expected  to live 
a more restricted,  perhaps  frustrated  life compared  with one kept 
for beef production.  After our ten years ’ experience  there is no 
doubt that we are now much more happy about keeping  bulls.  
We don’t see any major  problems  in handling  bulls for beef pro­
duction  and of course  the mains  electric  fencing  system  has really  
solved the problem  of confining  bulls at pasture.  This is import ­
ant since most of our cattle  whether  they are bulls or steers spend 
at least part of a second  season  at pasture.
In this .section  I have purposely  refrained  from making  reference  
to the possible  use of hormones  as a method  of bringing  steer  
performance  up towards  that of bulls because  I believe,  firstly,  
that non-castration  is the logical  way to get the extra growth  and, 
secondly,  I think definite  reactions  against  additives  are increasing  
throughout  the world.  This is certainly  the case in Europe.  Spend  
a moment  sometime  in thought,  as the late E. R. Orpen  would  
have done, as to why people  started  castrating  animals  many  years  
ago. Was it because:  (i) man was working  harder  physically  then 
and therefore  needed  a diet high in energy,  (ii) cattle  were u.sed 
as draught  animals,  (iii) fencing  and control  of livestock  were  
poor or (iv) husbandry  was poor, resulting  in low nutrition  and 
animals  had to be kept until they were quite old before  they were  
slaughtered  or perhaps  combinations  of all these. You will prob ­
ably agree  that none of these reasons  prevail  to-day.

OBSERVATIONS  ON THE BEEF INDUSTRY
The beef industry  is steeped  in a fair amount  of tradition  and 
I think it is reasonable  to say that many  of the people  who control  
it put a lot of emphasis  on the colour  of the animal ’s hair. At 
last it appears  the emphasis  will soon move away from the hair 
colour  or the head colour  of the animal (or indeed  whether  the 
animal  has calved  or not) to a more realistic  approach  of measur ­
ing yield of saleable  lean meat per animal  and the quality  of that 
lean meat.
The meat factories,  and particularly  those owned  by the pro­
ducers  themselves,  have a great responsibility  to encourage  efficient  
beef production.  The technology  of production  systems  is well 
advanced,  though  there is still much work to be done, particularly  
on efficiency  of labour use, and scale of operation.  Walshe^ ’* 
recently  put this concept  of labour  efficiency  very' simply  by say­
ing “if you pay £1,000  a year to a man to milk 30 cows, this 
results  in a charge  of over £30 per cow. ’’ The same thing holds in 
beef, the labour  charge  per animal  is extremely  important.
Rationalisation  and opportunism  in selling  are now an import ­
ant impetus  to action.  It is short sighted  to just find out what the 
market  wants to-day,  supply  what it wants and do no more. Of 
course  you must supply  the market  with what it wants  but much  
more emphasis  must be put on “trying ” new products  on the 
market  and these should be related to production  costs. These  
products  should be fully processed  right to the stage of cooking 
and flavouring,  as it is essential  that our main industry  gives  
maximum  employment  in a country  which has few sound basic  
industries.
Factories  must encourage  such systems  as the bred heifer  system  
which involves increasing  cattle numbers  without increasing  
milk production.  The operation  and economies  of this system  were 
discussed  by my colleague,  Sean Crowley,  at a meeting  of this 
Association  sometime  ago^''. This system by anv standards  is an 
attractive  one. It is biologically  a very efficient  wav of producing  
more calves and beef when milk is not required.  In the long run 
in spite of subsidy intervention,  the most efficient biological  
systems  within reason are the important  ones. It has the great  
advantage  compared  with single suckling  and to a lesser extent  
with multiple  suckling  that no animal  ever reaches  its mature  size 
and this has the effect of reducing  the maintenance  feed costs.  
Drennan^®  recently  reported  to this Association  that a well-man ­
aged single suckling  herd can give attractive  returns  per acre 
especially  since the subsidy  scheme  came into being.  The possibility  
of combining  single suckling,  bred-heifer  and multiple  suckling  is
24
worth thinking  about. This could give very substantial  increases 
in cattle numbers  without  extra milk. It means that every heifer  
would calve or at least be given the opportunity  to do so. 
I asked my colleague  Andy  Conway^®  to work out what this means  
in terms of numbers.  Remember  that a single  suckling  herd of say 
1,000 cows will yield annually  450 bullocks,  300 maiden  heifers  
and 150 culled cows assuming  15% replacement  and 10% 
mortality.  Combining  single suckling  and once-bred  heifer  systems  
the annual  yield of cattle for the base herd of 1,000 cows at full 
production  would  on Conway ’s figures  be 645 bullocks,  435 bred-  
heifers  and 150 culled cows. He has assumed  in these figures  that 
all heifers  would  calve but this is probably  counterbalanced  by the 
high mortality  figure (10%) which he used. Multiple  suckling 
the calves for the bred heifers  would require  another  16 to 20 
dairy cows per 100 bred-heifers  and this of course  would further  
increase  the potential  output.
You will recall that I said earlier  that non-castration  increases 
lean meat production  per animal  very considerably  (Table 20). 
This extra lean meat production  from  bulls is something  of supreme  
importance.  An estimate  of annual  bullock  slaughterings  in the 
country"  is about 320,000.  From that data I have shown  you that 
each one of these if kept entire would yield at least an extra  
20 kg of meat per animal,  assuming  that most of the steers are at 
least 500 kg at slaughter.  This represents  an extra yield of 640 M 
tons of meat. Taking  the data from Table 20 and taking  a price 
of 19p per lb. for carcass,  and therefore  at least 28p for lean 
meat,  we can estimate  that bulls would  give returns  of from £5 to 
£16 per head more than similarly  treated  steers. Indeed  it might  
be argued  that factories  could afford to give more for bull car­
casses  than for those from steers  because  there is less costs involved 
in removing  fat. You will recall (Tables  14 and 20) that the real 
difference  in bulls over steers comes in at the heavier  weights. 
In effect I am saying  that where  we are keeping  100 bullocks  at 
present,  90 or less bulls would produce  the same yield of meat at 
similar  feed costs and less processing  costs.
Bulls are an easy way of producing  really good yields of meat  
per animal.  New lights are shining  at last on their uses — in the 
factory  the cut-up trade is moving,  in the field mains electric  
fencing  is the answer to utilising  our grassland  by an efficient  
animal. I would not under-estimate  the importance  of animal  
breeding,  indeed  one must stress the lack of adequate  beef progeny  
and performance  testing  in this country.  However,  non-castration  
is a very easy, rapid way of increasing  meat production  without  
any major extra food costs. Factories  have an important  role to 
play in encouraging  bull beef production.
25
I suggested  earlier that the small man in calf rearing  should 
be multiple  or single suckling  and I could have added that he 
should have another  job outside  farming.  One would hope that 
some of these jobs would come from processing  meat and its 
ancillary  industries.  Processing  of all the meat produced  in the 
country  would provide  extensive  and much needed work. The 
spending  power of these extra workers  and their increased  con­
sumption  of agricultural  products  alone is interesting  to think  
about.
I must concede  that it is difficult  to organise  a sound  meat trade  
as long as the store trade exists in its present  form. However,  this 
store trade, in my opinion,  cannot  continue  indefinitely.  Firstly,  
we can not afford  to sell compensatory  growth  any longer.  Second ­
ly, it doesn ’t seem logical  to send a beast live by ship when in 
many instances  only about 30 per cent of it will be eaten as meat  
within  3 months.  Shipping  costs are just too great. I will not dwell 
further  on the possibilities  of the store trade, I will conclude  by 
suggesting  that a man of the calibre  of the late Edward  Richards  
Orpen would question  the logic of importing  phosphorus  at one 
end of the production  line and paying  again for its export  in the 
form  of bones  at the other  end.
Very many people,  particularly  at Grange,  helped me in tlie 
research  work I have described  in this paper, and in its prepar ­
ation. I would like to thank them sincerely  because  without  their  
co-operation  and enthusiasm  research  work on this scale would  not 
be possible.
I again thank the Edward  Richards  Orpen Memorial  Trust  
for inviting  me to give this lecture.

THE IRISH GRASSLAND  ASSOCIATION  was 
founded  in 1947 with the aim of promoting  the knowl ­
edge of grassland  production.
In 1961, the name of the Association  was modified,  
in recognition  of the fact that good grassland  husbandry  
is intimately  associated  with, and inseparable  from, good  
livestock  husbandry.
The Association  provides  an apportunity  for those 
interested  in modern  grassland  farming  to gather and 
interchange  views and ideas; it provides  a platform  for 
forward-looking  farmers  and scientists  to expound  their 
ideas;  it fosters  and encourages  research  into the produc ­
tion and utilisation  of grassland,  and it aims to co­
operate  with organisations  which has in common  the 
improvements  of grassland  farming.
If you or your organisation  would like to join the 
Irish Grassland  and Animal  Production  Association,  the 
Secretary,  An Foras Taluntais,  Creagh,  Ballinrobe,  Co. 
Mayo,  would  be pleased  to hear from you.
