Some Aspects  of Efficiency  
in Beef Production
Third  Edward  Richards-Orpen  Memorial  Lecture
presented  by
F. J. Harte,  M.Agr.Sc.,  Ph.D.
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
at the
Winter  Meeting  of the Irish Grassland  and Animal  
Production  Association,  November  27, 1970
Joseph  Harte  is Officer-in-Charge  at the Agricultural  Institute ’s 
Animal  Production  Research  Centre  at Grange,  Co. Meath.  He 
was born in Sligo and took his early education  at Summerhill  
College,  Sligo and at the Agricultural  College,  Mountbellew,  Co. 
Galway.  He graduated  from University  College,  Dublin in 1956 
with a First Class Honours  B.Agr.Sc.,  degree. He received  the 
M.Agr.Sc.,  degree  from University  College,  Dublin  in 1957 and 
his Ph.D.  from Trinity  College,  Dublin  in 1966.
In 1960 he spent a period of study with Dr. T. R. Preston  at 
the Rowett  Research  Institute  in Aberdeen  and in 1966-67  he 
studied under Professor  D. G. Armstrong  and Professor  McG.  
Cooper  at Newcastle-on-Tyne  University.  In 1969 he was awarded  
an O.E.E.C.  Fellowship  and studied  beef production  in France  and 
Holland.
Dr. Harte  has published  over 25 scientific  papers  and has written  
extensively  in the farming  press. He has lectured  throughout  the 
country  and at international  meetings  at home and abroad.  His 
research  work is concerned  with efficiency  in beef production  with 
special emphasis  on calf rearing,  breed comparisons  and bull 
beef production.
I would like to thank the Trustees  of the Edward  Richards-  
Orpen Memorial  Trust for asking me to give this, the third  
Edward  Richards-Orpen  Memorial  lecture.  I did not have the 
privilep  of knowing  the late Mr. Edward  Richards-Orpen,  but 
the tributes  paid to him by Dr. Walsh^  in the first lecture  are 
ample evidence  of his great contribution  to Irish Agriculture.
1 he aim in cattle production  should  be to produce  as efficiently  
as possible  cattle which are capable  of yielding  meat which is 
saleable  at the right price. This involves  the correct  use of land,  
labour  and capital.  Land will provide  the main traditional  sources  
of feed, though soon we may find increasing  amounts  of feed 
coming  from other sources.  Typical  e.xamples  are urea and pro­
teins from oil. Feed costs as a proportion  of total costs in cattle  
production  can vary quite considerably  but a figure of 70% is 
probably  a reasonable  estimate.  Therefore  the efficient  conversion  
of feed into liveweight,  or lean meat, is most important.  We have 
for long understood  the term efficiency  in pigs and poultry,  and 
farmers when selecting  stock are putting increasing  emphasis  
on the ability  of these species  to convert  feed efficiently.  It took 
the great work of Preston  and his colleagues  at the Rowett  Re­
search Institute  in Scotland  to emphasise  the importance  of 
efficiency  in beef production.  We must, however,  readily  admit  
that the expression  of efficiency  in terms of feed intake per unit 
of production  in ruminants  is not as simple  as in the monogastrics  
—pigs and poultry.  It is complicated  by the ability  of ruminants  
to utilise roughages  (of varying  quality)  as well as concentrates.
In Ireland  our ability  to grow good grass means  that many of 
our cattle  are born in the spring  and finished  in the autumn,  one, 
two or three years later. This results  in an uneven  distribution  of 
the direct produce  (milk, beef) throughout  the year. Also, the 
inter-dependence  between  dairying  and beef production  in Ireland  
is not common  to all beef producing  countries.  Yet we all realise 
that an efficient  cattle industry  will need to provide  the market  
with a continuous  supply  of meat of consistent  quality  at a com­
petitive  price.
In this lecture  I will discuss  three main aspects  of my work at 
Grange  associated  with biological  efficiency  in beef production.
1. Systems  of calf rearing.
2. Efficiency  of different  breeds  for meat production.
3. Effect of non-castration  in cattle on efficiency  of pro­
duction.
I hope to show that a good calf-rearing  system,  coupled  with 
effects of breed and non-castration  on carcass  composition,  will 
improve  efficiency  and profitability  of beef production.  I also 
hope to show how we can manipulate  our cattle  breeds,  or perhaps
I should  say our cattle of different  growth  potential,  to niaxiinisc 
lean meat production  and, in particular,  to show how the use of 
bulls can increase  lean meat production.
SYSTEMS  OF CALF REARING
Time will not allow a full review of research  work on calf 
rearing  carried  out in this country  and elsewhere.  Many of you 
know tliat for many years after the State was formed  Professor 
E. J. Sheehy  and his colleagues  at University  College,  Dublin,  
particularly  Dr. B. Senior,  contributed  vastly to our knowledge 
on calf rearing^. Their practical  and realistic approach  is 
acknowledged  at both national  and international  level, and much 
of our present  knowledge  on this subject  is due to their pioneering  
work. This work is being continued  at University  College  in 
Professor  Ruane ’s Department  and names like Aherne,  Caffrey,  
Cahill,  L’Estrange  and McAleese^  * among  others,  are well known 
to you. Preston^  starting  at Newcastle  University,  later at the 
Rowett  Research  Institute  and now working  in Cuba, Roy and 
co-workers®  at the National  Institute  for Research  in Dairying,  
Shinfield,  Alder^ and Tayler®  from Hurley,  among  many others,  
have all made very valuable  contributions  to our knowledge  of 
calf rearing  for beef.
Calving  pattern
In discussing  calf rearing  in this country  one must emphasise 
that most of our calves are born in the first half of the year. Of 
the 1.6 million  cows in the National  Herd®,  88% calve between  
January  and May inclusive^®.  The remaining  12% of our cows  
calve in a fairly scattered  pattern  over the second  half of the year 
but mainly  in autumn.  This leaves  us with two distinct  calf rearing  
situations; —
(a) Spring rearing; where there is whole milk (relatively  
cheap), skim milk, milk replacers,  meals and grass availalde.
(b) Autumn  rearing;  where there is little or no grass or skim 
milk and only milk replacers  and relatively  expensive  whole milk 
and meals available.
There  is unfortunately  no one system  of calf rearing  that I can 
recommend  for either autumn  or spring rearing.  Obviously  much  
will depend  on the cost of the various  feed ingredients  and their  
availability  to individual  farmers.  For instance  the Government  
policy of insisting  on a minimum  inclusion  of butterfat  in milk 
replacers  caused  an immediate  increase  in prices even though  the 
price of skim milk (one of the main constituents  of replacers)  was 
falling.
Feeding  value of various  foods
I will now discuss  the value of the various  feeds available  for 
calf rearing.  It is, of course,  well known  to you that for at least 
the first 3 to 5 weeks of the calf’s life the feed must be given 
in liquid form and it must be milk, milk products  or a diet at 
least almost  as good as milk in nutritional  value. The importance  
of feeding  colostrum  within  the first few hours after birth is now 
v/ell established^'.
Milk replacers
I’he following  table shows the performance  of calves fed whole 
milk and milk replacers'®.
TABLE  1. Liveweight  (kg) of calves  fed 
or whole  milk and skim milk.different  milk
Liveweight  atreplacers
Days of age 28 56 84
Milk replacer  A 44.4 61.5 77.3

Milk replacer  C
Whole  milk to 28 days44.9 61.9 75.9
followed  by skim milk 50.0 67.7 82.7
These milk replacers  are based almost  completely  on dried skim  
milk products  plus 10-20%  animal  fat (tallow  and/or  butterfat).  
From this and other experiments  at Grange  we estimate  that 4 
litres of whole milk is equivalent  in feeding  value to 0.,5 kg of 
milk replacer  approximately.  If milk replacer  costs 16p per kg, 
this suggests  that you should  use it in preference  to whole  milk if 
you are getting more than a clear lip per 5.0 litres. Costs of 
heating  water, mixing facilities  and labour must be taken into 
account  when costing  milk replacers.  If you are using whole  milk 
you would, of course, need to have a ready supply available.  
However,  to date, at any rate, most calf rearing  farms also have  
cows.'®
Milk replacers  have the great advantage  that they are con­
centrated  and are easily stored. They obviously  have a most  
important  part to play in autumn  calf rearing  where  either  whole 
milk is not available  or is being produced  and sold at a relatively  
high price. Certainly  in veal units where  the emphasis  is on high 
calf gains, milk replacers  have an advantage  over whole milk in 
that the dry matter  content  of the liquid being fed can be in­
creased;  this allows for an increased  intake of dry matter and
reduces costs of heating  water and feeding.  Because  of their  
convenience  in feeding  systems  and likely improved  quality  due to 
better formulation,  there seems little doubt that milk replacers  
have a bright  future  in calf rearing,  particularly  when milk prices 
increase.
Skim milk feeding
The Institute ’s Farm Management  Survey^"  shows that 77%  
of the skim milk returned  to farmers  is used for calf feeding  and 
in 1969 it was estimated  that farmers  u.sed 955 million  litres in 
this way. Many nutritionists  would suggest  that a considerably  
greater  proportion  should be fed to pigs but that is one of the 
privileges  of being a farmer  — he can still decide for himself.  
What then is the values  of skim milk in calf rearing?  Calf per­
formance  will be hopelessly  low if calves are fed on skim milk 
before 3-4 weeks of age. However,  there are a number  of dr\- 
fat/protein  supplements  coming  on the market now, and when 
added to skim milk these are giving most promising  results,  even 
in early life. After 4 to 5 weeks of age calves will do quite well 
on skim milk, provided  they have grass  and/or  meals'®.
Our results show that 5 litres of skim milk are equivalent  or 
somewhat  superior  to 0.5 kg of rolled barley  from approximatelv  
6-8 weeks of age. These results were obtained  with calves at 
pasture.  They are not likely to be very' different  in indoor  rearing  
systems  provided  the necessary  vitamins  are added  to the feed and 
the calv'es  are fed either  high quality  hay or silage.  If, for instance  
rolled barley is worth 3p per kg (or £1.50 per cwt.) then skim 
milk can be fed if you have it or can buy it cheaper  than Ip per 
5 litres. It is really up to the farmer  and his advisor  to work 
this one out.
When,  however,  one is feeding  a food of low dry matter  content  
such as skim milk there is an important  aspect of management  
to remember.  Suppose  a farmer  has 50 calves and he decides  
to feed 1 kg of rolled barley/head/day,  this means  taking  out to 
the held 50 kg of rolled  barley.  An equivalent  of skim milk would  
weigh 450 kg (i.e. 50x9) plus containers.  In the past we have 
stressed  the importance  of good grass in calf rearing ” and without  
it good calf performance  at pasture  is almost impossible  unless  
meals are fed. Having  good grass available  means some form of 
rotational  grazing,  resulting  in the calves being a considerable  
distance  away from the yard at least for part of the grazing  season.  
Therefore  good grassland  management  and skim milk feeding  do 
not always  go together,  particularly  in big units because  of the 
transport  costs involved.
As you move up in scale of operation  you can see that a low 
dry matter  food is at a serious  disadvantage  and here is a case 
where  what is the cheapest  food may not be the most economical  
one to use. Present  day costs of drying  skim milk would not leave  
it competitive  with meals if used in the dried or reconstituted  
form.
Meal feeding
Calves  should be offered  meals from 4 days of age. It will be 
appreciated  that calves could live on meals only from 4 days of 
age® However,  liveweight  gains are not just adequate
for present day production  requirements  if calves are weaned  
at this early age. Nevertheless,  you must remember  that meals  
cost about one-third  of the price of whole milk on a dry matter  
basis. So unless  you have cheap  skim milk you should  use as much 
meals  as the calf can digest.
In my opinion,  taking the present  inputs and returns  in cattle  
production,  calves should be off milk (except  low-priced  skim)  
by 8 weeks  of age.
Multiple  sucklings
In many  areas in this country  prices  for whole  milk are relatively  
low. From what I have said earlier about the relative  values of 
whole milk and milk replacer  you will appreciate  it would be 
more economical  in many cases to feed whole milk, produced  on 
the farm, rather  than use milk replacers.  Would  it be better then 
to feed the whole milk directly  from the cow rather than milk 
it and then feed it to the calf? It does not seem logical to milk 
a cow and then feed that milk to the calves,  particularly  when the 
cow will give more milk when multiple  suckled  than when she is 
machine  milked.  Of course  there is still a considerable  amount  of 
work to be done on the effects of plane of nutrition  in the calf 
stage on performance  later in life'" but in general  multiple
suckling  tends to provide  the calf with a higher  plane of nutrition  
than bucket  rearing  systems.
As a result of five years research  work we set up a system  at 
Orange,  details of which I described  to this -Association  at a 
previous  meeting'®  2' and elsewhere^^  You will recall we used 
eight cows which suckled 48 calves (i.e. 6 calves each) from 
March to November,  and 8 hectares  provided  the grazing  and 
silage for the cows and calves for the whole year. Table 2 shows  
the calf performances  from our multiple  suckling  unit during  the 
past 4 years.

The calves were born in mid-March  each year. In the first 
three years the calves used were Hereford  X Shorthorns  and all 
were castrated.  In 1970 half the calves were pure Friesians,  the 
other half were Hereford  X Shorthorns  and half of each group  
was castrated.  The results  were quite consistent  from year to year. 
The weight range of calves was narrow  and the mortality  was 
never  more than 2%.
Economic  returns  per acre are always  difficult  to estimate  be­
cause of the controversy  of incoming  and outgoing  prices and of 
course  gross margins.  My estimates  for costs and returns  in our 
multiple  suckling  unit are given in Table  3.

A. Conway,  one of my colleagues  from our Economics  Section^ ’
has calculated  the effect of buying and selling prices on gross  
margins  per acre. His results  are sliown  in Table  4 assuming  vari­
able costs per acre of £47. It is obvious  that the differential  be­
tween buying  and selling  prices  has a very important  influence  on 
the gross margin.  This differential  has been fairly stable over the 
years particularly  if you take into account  changes  in money 
values,  when we were paying  £10 for a calf we were getting  about  
£50 to £60 for it at 2 years and now when we pay £30 per calf 
we get £80 to £100  at 2years.

The gross margins  are certainly  attractive  and the labour  inputs  
are not usually high. The capital investment  in livestock  per 
acre is probably  not too different  from that for dairying  and of 
course there is less equipment  involved.  The livestock  investment  
per acre is of course lower than in an intensive  calf unit on its 
own where  in general  weight  gains per calf will be lower. I have  
explained  on a previous  occasion^^  that grassland  management  is 
simpler  in a multiple  suckling  unit than in an intensive  calf unit 
because  the cows in the former  graze the pasture  after the calves  
resulting  in high quality  grass being available  to the calves in 
the next round  of the rotation.
It is important  here to emphasise  that in all our suckling  units  
at Grange  the health of the calves was better than in the non­
suckling  units. Mortality  in calf rearing  can vary enormously  but 
it appears  from our work to date that calf mortality,  which is 
normally  about 4-5% in bucket  rearing  systems,  is 1-2% or less 
in the multiple  suckling  systems.  Incidentally  one obvious  source 
of calves  for multiple  suckling  is the once bred heifer  system  which  
I refer to later.
Environment
Very little useful research  work has been done on environment
9
in relation  to calf rearing  in this country.  Let me simply  state that 
our two main disease problems  in calf production  are virus 
pneumonia  and salmonellosis.  The Veterinary  Research  Labor ­
atory, Abbotstown,  is now carrying  out some trials at Grange  
on the possible  use of vaccines  to control  salmonella.  While we 
wait the results  of these investigations  we feel that the best way 
to reduce  the incidences  of these diseases  is to rear the calves  out 
of doors,  or at least in very open environments.
The organisation  of calf feeding
With good farm workers  getting scarce and expensive,  the 
organisation  and management  of calf units are very important  
and I covered  aspects  of this work previouslyI  have already-  
indicated  that in some cases the direct value of a feeding  stuff 
like skim milk could be counter  balanced  by the costs of feeding.
Once-a-day  feeding
Our experiments  show that if milk is fed at less tlian 7 litres  
per head per day there is no point in feeding  twice daily after  
10-14 days of age. There is also room for reducing  weekend 
work^^.  In an 80-100  calf unit it will take a man at least 2-3 hours 
to prepare,  feed and wash up twice daily. This means  if you fed 
once daily you will obviously  save a considerable  amount  of time.  
Furthermore  there is the important  social aspects  where the farm  
worker  or farmer  would not be committed  to feeding  his calves  
on Saturday  and Sunday  afternoons.
Once-a-day  milking  in the later part of the lactation  in the 
multiple  suckling  systems  which I have discussed  should be con­
sidered. John Walsh at Moorepark  has shown that once-daily  
milking  in later lactation  reduced  daily yield by about 40%.  
This is not a very big reduction  since the yield at that stage of 
the lactation  is low.
The possibility  of increasing  the dry matter  in the liquid feed 
is also an important  way of improving  efficiency  in organisation  
of feeding.  I would suggest  however  that this should not be at­
tempted  before  3 weeks  of age.
The calfeteria
The calfeteria  system is a very useful way of feeding  calves.  
It consists  of a steel ring which  holds a series of teats from which 
tubes drop into a creamery  can, and each calf suckles  its milk 
through  an individual  teat “‘. This is a very suitable  way of feeding 
10 or more calves  of the same age. Obviously  if calves  vary con­
siderably  in age then the older calves tend to get too much of the 
total milk allowance  to the detriment  of the younger  calves. As
10
I indicated  earlier  it is not good economics  to feed milk to calves  
once they have reached  the age when they can utilise meals  
satisfactorily.
From an organisation  point of view let me remind  you that 
suckling  32 calves on 8 cows simultaneously,  as described  in the 
multiple  suckling  system, is attractive.  It is a fine “automatic  
milking  unit” where  the cows need no stimulation.
What then is the best way for a man to rear his calves?  As I 
see it if he is a small farmer  with 5-10 cows particularly  in an 
area where  the creamery  milk price is low then he should  multiple  
suckle.  It is an efficient  and economical  method  of rearing  calves 
in areas where milk prices are low. Other factors  in favour  of 
multiple  suckling  (as against  bucket  rearing  or whole milk) are 
the health  of calves,  and the fact that cows suckled  out fully twice 
daily can give up to 15% more milk than similarly  fed cows  
machine  milked twice daily^'.I  believe  that the specialised  dairy  
man will not want to rear calves, and consequently  there is 
always  likely to be a ready supply  of calves  for multiple  suckling.
The dairy farmer  who rears his own calves  and who has milking  
equipment  installed  may decide  that he wants to put all his cows  
through  the plant. But he should  consider  using those cows that 
are on their last lactation  for multiple  suckling.  The problems  of 
getting  them in calf without  a bull do not arise. Much will also 
depend  on the price he receives  for whole milk and skim milk 
and this can vary considerably  throughout  the country.  This 
farmer  may decide  to use milk replacer  or to feed whole  milk and 
meals  at pasture  or perhaps  skim milk instead  of meals.
The farmer producing  liquid milk will almost certainly  use 
milk replacer  particularly  in autumn  and winter  which will be 
his main calving  time. The ability  of meals  to substitute  milk must  
always  be remembered  particularly  when milk prices  are relatively  
high and in general  calves should  be fully off milk replacer  and 
on to meals by eight weeks.  Veal producers,  because  of the special  
product  required,  must use milk replacers.  Of course  any farmer  
who does not discuss  his calf rearing  with his Agricultural  Adviser 
is really not using intelligently  a service  which  is available  to him.
Effect  of breed and castration  on efficient  meat production
I have talked  on some aspects  of calf rearing  to this association  
previously^^ and have discussed  the finishing  of cattle. Now  
I wish to turn to efficiency  of lean meat production.  What are 
the main factors  which will influence  the yield of lean meat per 
animal?  I believe  that maximising  yield of acceptable  meat per 
animal  is going to be extremely  important  in the future.  Because 
of problems  of selling  dairy products,  it appears  that the day is
11
fast approaching  when the dairy industry  will no longer  be giving  
us calves  as a by-product  for the beef industry.  Indeed  the returns  
from calf sales are now a most important  part of the total returns  
for a dairy herd. If cows have to be kept just to produce  calves  
alone obviously  the yield of lean meat per animal  is going to be 
of critical  importance.  Assuming  that the calf price is an indic ­
ation of the costs of producing  a new-born  calf (although  this is 
not always  the case) then Table  5 is of interest.  Carroll  in a paper  
to this Association  stressed  this point”.
TABLE  5. Spread  of calf prices  on slaughter  weights.
Calf price Charge  (p)on carcass at (kg)*
(£ per head) 100 200 400
10 10 5 2.5
20 20 10 5.0
30 30 15 7.5
40 40 20 10
*new  pence  per kg carcass
One hundred  kg is approximately  the carcass  weight  of a veal 
animal  while  very many  of the cattle killed in France  have carcass  
weights  as high or higher  than 400 kg. The cost of slaughtering  
a small as against  a big animal is also worth thinking  about.  
Preston and Willis^®  in an excellent  book on beef production,  
just published,  rightly stressed  the importance  of the biological  
efficiency  of the animal and therefore  come down in favour  of 
killing animals  young.  We must however  also take into account  
the feed costs of bringing  the animal  into this world,  i.e. maternal  
costs. Obviously,  on the other hand, no animal  should be kept 
to an old age as its efficiency  will be uneconomical  and its meat  
quality will not be acceptable.  The two approaches  must be 
“married ” as regards  optimum  yield of edible meat per animal.
Different  feed ingredients  and level of feeding^®  will, of
course,  influence  carcass  composition  but at this stage I want to 
talk about the effect of breed and castration  on performance  of 
lean meat production.
EFFECTS  OF BREED  ON EFFICIENCY  OF MEAT  
PRODUCTION
Growth  rate
Let us look now at some of the results  obtained  when we com­
pared the performances  of different  breeds and crosses  of cattle
12
for beef production.  There was little or no difference  in growth  
rate between  Hereford  X Shorthorns  and pure Friesians.  Aberdeen  
Angus-cross  Shorthorns  were slower growing  than either of the 
other two types. The results of these experiments  have already  
been published^**  In another  series of experiments®^  the
crosses  of Friesian,  Hereford  and Charolais  bulls on Friesian  and 
Shorthorn  cows were compared.  In the first one of these experi ­
ments pure Friesians,  Hereford  X Shorthorns  and Charolais  X 
Shorthorns  were compared.  The Charolais  bulls used in this experi ­
ment were imported  from the U.S. In the second  experiment  the 
Charolais  bulls used were imported  from France,  and Hereford  
X Shorthorns,  Charolais  X Shorthorns  and Hereford  X Friesians  
were compared.  In both of these experiments  there was no signifi ­
cant difference  between  the various  breeds  and crosses  in growth  
rate. The tests were carried  out over an average  of 445 days and 
the mean growth  rate was 0.75 kg per day and ranged  from 0.73 
to 0.80 kg per day. Vial®**,  in a large-scale  experiment  comparing  
nine different  breeds or crosses, showed that there was little 
difference  between Charolais  crosses and pure Friesians,  the 
Charolais  in fact having the slower growth.  The results of his 
experiment  are not fully analysed.  The Meat and Livestock  Com ­
mission  in England  reported  that the Charolais  crosses  performed  
.somewhat  better than the Hereford  crosses but it must be re­
membered  that their results  were from suckler  herds where  a full 
expression  of growth  performance  was allowed.
Feed efficiency
Table 6 shows the feed consumed  per kg of liveweight  gain in 
the Charolais  series of experiments.  All the animals  were fed 
individually.  These results are not fully analysed®®  but there  
appears  to be no major difference  between  breeds  and crosses  as 
regards  feed efficiency  per unit of gain.

The feed measurements  in experiment  1 were taken from 200 
to 635 days and in experiment  2 from 150 to 603 days.
Carcass  yield
Dressing  out percentage  is taken here as the number  of units  
of carcass per 100 units of liveweight  at slaughter.  When we 
slaughtered  Friesians  at 545 kg, Hereford  X Shorthorns  at 500 kg 
and Aberdeen  Angus  X Shorthorns  at 455 kg we found no differ ­
ence in dressing  out percentage  but when these breeds  were killed  
at the same liveweight  the Friesians  killed out worst''".  Table 7 
shows the carcass  weights  and the dressing  out prercentages  in 
the experiments  when  Charolais  crosses  were used.

Friesians 514 54.2
The Friesians  killed out less than the cross-breeds  but this is 
likely to occur only when the slaughter  weights  are low. Our 
other experiments  showed that when Friesians  were allowed  to 
go to fairly heavy  weights  they kill out just as well as beef crosses'"'.  
Differences  in dressing  out percentage  between  the two experi ­
ments (Table  7) serve to stress the weakness  of comparing  dressing 
out percentage  between  experiments.  In experiment  1 the figures  
are based on full body weights  while in the other experiment  
carcass  weights  were expressed  as a percentage  of a fasted body 
weight.  These results  serve a warning  to those who tend to com­
pare breeds without  determining  the circumstances  under which  
dressing  out figures  were calculated.  The results  also help to ex­
plain why some farmers  get different  dressing  out figures when 
they bring their cattle to the factory.  Transport  conditions,  dis­
tance and type of feed will all influence  dressing  out percentage  
because  of their  effects  on gut fill.
Carcass  shape
Considerable  importance  has been put on the shape of the live 
animal  in the past and it is reasonable  to assume  that the shape
14
of the live animal  would be reflected  in carcass  shape. Carcass  
shape in turn might  be expected  to be related  to the proportion  of 
high-priced  cuts in the carcass.  Whether  there is in fact much  
relationship  between  these various  factors is now open to great  
doubt^*.  Obviously  the really important  thing is the proportion  of 
total carcass  lean meat occurring  in the high-priced  cuts. There  
IS considerable  variation  in defining  what is a high-priced  cut. 
Where we used a slightly  modified  version  of tlie I^ondon  and 
a slightly  modified  version  of the American  box beef method  of 
carcass cutting^®.  Only in experiments  where the same method  
of cutting  is used is it valid to compare  the results  from different  
experiments.  It is not valid to compare  breeds which have been 
cut in different  ways but unfortunately  many people  tend to do 
this.
The percentage  of total carcass lean meat occurring  in the 
high-priced  cuts was 50.2, 48.7 and 50.5 in one experiment  and 
it was 48.8, 47.7 and 47.9 in another  experiments^  for Friesians, 
Hereford  X Shorthorns  and Aberdeen  Angus X Shorthorns  re­
spectively.  In the second experiment,  particularly,  the Friesians  
appeared  to have poor confirmation  compared  to the Alierdecn  
Angus  crosses,  yet there was no major  difference  in the proportion  
of high-priced  cuts, the advantage,  if any being in favour of 
Friesians.  Table 8 shows the proportion  of carca.ss lean meat  
occurring  in the high-priced  cuts in the series of e.xperiinents 
involving  Charolais  crossesS®.

There was in fact no major difference  between  any of the 
breeds  or crosses  in this respect.
Carcass  composition
In our first experiments^  with Friesians,  Hereford  X Shorthorns  
and Aberdeen  Angus  X Shorthorns,  the figures  for the percentages  
of lean meat in the carcass  were 71.1, 65.8 and 67.0 respectively. 
In the second  experiment  using the same breeds  and crosses*^  the 
figures were 70.7, 67.7 and 65.3 and in that experiment  the
15
Friesians  would not be regarded  as finished  by present-day  com­
mercial  standards.  The Friesians  had therefore  significantly  more 
lean meat in their carcasses  than beef crosses  in the first experi ­
ment, and in the second exp)eriment,  even though they had a 
lower dressing  out percentage  (2 units),  they had more lean meat  
per animal  than the Aberdeen  Angus  crosses  and similar  amounts  
to the Hereford  crosses  (Table  9).

In the group of experiments  involving  Charolais  crosses the 
figures for carcass  composition  are given in Tables 10 and 11. 
The method  of carcass  analysis  used in the Charolais  series of 
experiments  was different  from that used in the earlier experi ­
ments involving  Friesians,  Hereford  X Shorthorns  and Aberdeen  
Angus X Shorthorns ’^. Comparisons  therefore  are only valid 
within  the experimental  series.

The carcass  weights  of H. X Sh. H. X Fr. and Ch. X Sh. were 
290, 285 and 293 respectively.
The Charolais  crosses  had one percentage  unit more lean meat  
than the pure Friesians  and over 4 percentage  units more than 
the Hereford  X Shorthorns  in the first experiment  (Table  10). 
1 here is, however  no evidence  of the Charolais  crosses  having  this 
extra lean in the high-priced  cuts (Table 8). This experiment  
suggests  that using a Hereford  sire on Friesians  reduces  the lean 
meat content  (Table  11) of the carcasses  of the progeny.
Table 7 shows that the pure Friesians  had lower dressing-out  
figures (3 units) than the H. X sh. or Ch. X Shorthorns.  The 
important  thing is yield of lean meat per animal  and this is set 
out in Table  12.

Fr. 514 54.2 190.6
You can see that the low dressing  out percentage  in the Friesians  
compared  to the Hereford  X Shorthorns  is counter-balanced  by 
the higher lean meat content  of the Friesian  carcasses.  The 
Charolais  cros.ses had a significantly  higher yield of meat per 
unit of liveweight  than the Friesians  and Hereford  X Shorthorns  
This is likely to be impwrtant  when transport,  killing and pro­
duction  costs are taken into account.  However,  the differences  
between  Charolais  crosses and Friesians  are likelv to be much  
less (if they exist at all) in situations  where Friesians  are taken  
to heavier  weights.
Meat:  Bone ratios
Too much emphasis  on meat to bone ratio can be misleading. 
This can be seen clearly  from the results of one of our experi ­
ments®^  on breed  comparisons  (Table  13).
TABLE  13. Carcass  weights,  yield of meat, fat and bone (kg) 
and meat to bone ratios.

The Friesians  had an inferior  meat to bone ratio compared  
to the Hereford  crosses.  Both groups  produced  similar  yields of 
meat (189 kg) although  the Friesans  had lighter  carcasses.  Con- 
.sequently,  comparing  meat; hone ratios in different  e.xperiments  
is a waste  of time unless  exactly  the same measurements  are used.
In summary  tlien it can be stated  that Charolais  cros.ses  did not 
grow significantly  faster than the Friesians  or Hereford  crosses.  
They did have a better killing  out percentage  than the Friesians. 
This might  not happen  if all animals  were allowed  to go to heavier  
weights —something  which I feel will be essential  in the future,  
though at present  it does leave the Charolais  crosses with this 
advantage.  The Charolais  crosses  had advantages  over the Here ­
ford crosses  and to a considerably  lesser extent  over the Friesians  
as regards  absolute  yield of lean meat and percentage  yield of 
lean meat in the carcasses.  However  there is no evidence  that 
this extra lean meat occurred  in the high-priced  cuts. The Char ­
olais also has the advantage  of being a ‘beef ’ breed and to date 
at least that seems to be important  in the store trade which does 
not lack its .share  of traditionalism  and conservatism.
In this country  there is obviously  a place for the various  breeds. 
The pure Friesian  has the big advantage  that it is dual-purpose  
and also that a cross-breeding  programme  is not needed  to ensure 
its survival.  A real dual-purpose  breed has the further  advantage  
that greater selection  for milk potential  is fxissible.  There are 
simply more females  to select from and I understand  from my 
colleague  Cunningham® ’ that there is no antagonism  between  
selecting  for milk and beef simultaneously.  To maintain  any 
advantage  the Charolais  may have over the Friesian  it will be 
necessary  to dispel  any fears that are associated  with the Charolais  
cross as regards  calving  difficulties.  I understand  however  this is 
being investigated  in France  and of course the Milk Marketing  
Board in England  are also looking  at this problem.  I have only 
discussed  a few of the breeds  available  to us. The importation  of 
the fast growing  South Devon,  and I hope many other breeds, 
will soon present  us with an opportunity  to test the lean meat  
production  potential  of these  various  breeds.
EFFECT  OF CASTRATION  ON PERFORMANCE
Some aspects  of our work on effect of castration  of cattle on 
performance  has been submitted  to a previous  meeting  of this 
Association®*,  and the whole subject of meat production  from 
entire male animals  was discussed  at a recent conference  in 
Bristol®*.  Our work at Grange®*  ®® ®* ®* '‘® agrees  quite well
with world literature  on the subject  and is summarised  as follows:
18
1. Bulls grow  8-15%  faster  than steers.
2. Bulls convert food into liveweight,  carcass or lean meat  
more efficiently  than steers.
3. Bulls yield more lean meat and less fat per unit of body  
weight  than steers.
Table 14 shows the difference  in growth rate l)etween  bulbs 
and steers,  slaughtered  at either  17 or 23 months  of age.
T.4BLE  14. Liveweight  performances  (kg) and differences  be­
tween groups of bulls and steers slaughtered  at

% difference  in favour  of bulls 17.5 17.4
The final liveweight  of the bulls and steers slaughtered  at 23 
months  of age was 613 and 552 kg respectively  (Table 14) a 
difference  of 61 kg (nearly li cwt.). All the animals  were fed 
similarly.  In effect 20 animals  kept under these circumstances  as 
bulls would yield over 20 cwt more liveweight  than if they were 
steers— equivalent  to almost  2 extra  bullocks.
Feed efficiency
Bulls are more efficient  than steers in converting  feed into 
liveweight  or lean meat (Table  15).

All animals  were slaughtered  at 13 months.
Bulls grow more efficiently  than steers because  firstly they grow 
faster (they use less of their food for maintenance  per unit of 
gain) and secondly  because  they lay down less fat in their car­
casses than steers. It is well known  that it is 6 to 7 times more 
expensive,  in terms of energy,  to lay down fatty rather  than lean 
tissue.
Breed effect
I would like to emphasise  at this stage that all this work was 
done on Friesian  cattle. We have now some evidence,  coming  to 
hand, which suggests  that growth  in favour  of bulls may not be 
as great in Hereford  X Shorthorns  as in the Friesians.  Further  
work is now in progress  at Grange  on this subject.
Carcass  yield
Steers  tended  to have somewhat  better  dressing  out figures  than 
bulls (Table  16) except  in one of the groups  in the 1964 experi ­
ment where the bulls were much heavier  than the steers at 
slaughter.  There is considerable  evidence  to show that dressing 
out percentage  improves  as liveweight  increases ’*®.

However,  most of these differences  are due to the extra yield  
of kidney  and channel  fat in the steers^^  and kidney  and channel  
fat is a poor seller.
When we cut the bull and steer carcasses  into the various  
commercial  cuts we found that bulls have heavier  chucks (neck 
region,  a cheap  cut) than steers.

Bulls have however  projxjrtionately  heavier  rounds  than steers 
as shown in Table 18'“. The animals  in groups  A and B were  
slaughtered  at 17 months  and these in groups C and D at 23 
months  of age.
Carcass  composition
Table 19 shows the percentage  yield of the 3 components  of 
the carcass ’*. In this instance  “meat ” is taken as the carcass  less 
subcutaneous  fat and bone. Fat is taken as subcutaneous  fat plus 
kidney  and channel  fat.

You will note that the bulls and steers were killed at either  
17 or 23 months  of age. The percentage  meat content  of the car­
casses from the older animals  (71.8%  of carcass)  is particularly  
significant.  This suggests  that there was no tendency  for the 
bulls to grow fatter with age compared  with similarly  managed  
steers.

The ability  of bulls to yield ‘ meat ”
Table 20 compares  the ability  of bulls to produce  “meat ” with  
that of similarly  fed steers.
The figure  of 28 per cent more meat than in a comparable  steer  
is especially  significant.  It is particularly  worth emphasising  here 
again that this extra “meat ” is obtained  with almost no extra  
food costs. There  remains  the question  of the quality  of bull meat  
compared  with steers. At present  the Institute ’s Meat Research  
Department  is doing  some work in this field. The World  literature  
comparing  bull and steer meat suggests  that there is little differ ­
ence in meat quality  with some very slight evidence  in favour  of 
steers^®
Behaviour  of bulls
I have discussed  this at a previous  meeting  of this Association. 
It is indeed diflBcult  to evaluate  scientifically  whether  bulls are 
more difficult  to manage  than steers. Certainly  the average  in­
dividual ’s view of bulls is biassed  by the behaviour  of stock bulls  
— but do let us remember  that this animal  is expected  to live 
a more restricted,  perhaps  frustrated  life compared  with one kept 
for beef production.  After our ten years ’ experience  there is no 
doubt that we are now much more happy about keeping  bulls.  
We don’t see any major  problems  in handling  bulls for beef pro­
duction  and of course  the mains  electric  fencing  system  has really  
solved the problem  of confining  bulls at pasture.  This is import ­
ant since most of our cattle  whether  they are bulls or steers spend 
at least part of a second  season  at pasture.
In this .section  I have purposely  refrained  from making  reference  
to the possible  use of hormones  as a method  of bringing  steer  
performance  up towards  that of bulls because  I believe,  firstly,  
that non-castration  is the logical  way to get the extra growth  and, 
secondly,  I think definite  reactions  against  additives  are increasing  
throughout  the world.  This is certainly  the case in Europe.  Spend  
a moment  sometime  in thought,  as the late E. R. Orpen  would  
have done, as to why people  started  castrating  animals  many  years  
ago. Was it because:  (i) man was working  harder  physically  then 
and therefore  needed  a diet high in energy,  (ii) cattle  were u.sed 
as draught  animals,  (iii) fencing  and control  of livestock  were  
poor or (iv) husbandry  was poor, resulting  in low nutrition  and 
animals  had to be kept until they were quite old before  they were  
slaughtered  or perhaps  combinations  of all these. You will prob ­
ably agree  that none of these reasons  prevail  to-day.

OBSERVATIONS  ON THE BEEF INDUSTRY
The beef industry  is steeped  in a fair amount  of tradition  and 
I think it is reasonable  to say that many  of the people  who control  
it put a lot of emphasis  on the colour  of the animal ’s hair. At 
last it appears  the emphasis  will soon move away from the hair 
colour  or the head colour  of the animal (or indeed  whether  the 
animal  has calved  or not) to a more realistic  approach  of measur ­
ing yield of saleable  lean meat per animal  and the quality  of that 
lean meat.
The meat factories,  and particularly  those owned  by the pro­
ducers  themselves,  have a great responsibility  to encourage  efficient  
beef production.  The technology  of production  systems  is well 
advanced,  though  there is still much work to be done, particularly  
on efficiency  of labour use, and scale of operation.  Walshe^ ’* 
recently  put this concept  of labour  efficiency  very' simply  by say­
ing “if you pay £1,000  a year to a man to milk 30 cows, this 
results  in a charge  of over £30 per cow. ’’ The same thing holds in 
beef, the labour  charge  per animal  is extremely  important.
Rationalisation  and opportunism  in selling  are now an import ­
ant impetus  to action.  It is short sighted  to just find out what the 
market  wants to-day,  supply  what it wants and do no more. Of 
course  you must supply  the market  with what it wants  but much  
more emphasis  must be put on “trying ” new products  on the 
market  and these should be related to production  costs. These  
products  should be fully processed  right to the stage of cooking 
and flavouring,  as it is essential  that our main industry  gives  
maximum  employment  in a country  which has few sound basic  
industries.
Factories  must encourage  such systems  as the bred heifer  system  
which involves increasing  cattle numbers  without increasing  
milk production.  The operation  and economies  of this system  were 
discussed  by my colleague,  Sean Crowley,  at a meeting  of this 
Association  sometime  ago^''. This system by anv standards  is an 
attractive  one. It is biologically  a very efficient  wav of producing  
more calves and beef when milk is not required.  In the long run 
in spite of subsidy intervention,  the most efficient biological  
systems  within reason are the important  ones. It has the great  
advantage  compared  with single suckling  and to a lesser extent  
with multiple  suckling  that no animal  ever reaches  its mature  size 
and this has the effect of reducing  the maintenance  feed costs.  
Drennan^®  recently  reported  to this Association  that a well-man ­
aged single suckling  herd can give attractive  returns  per acre 
especially  since the subsidy  scheme  came into being.  The possibility  
of combining  single suckling,  bred-heifer  and multiple  suckling  is
24
worth thinking  about. This could give very substantial  increases 
in cattle numbers  without  extra milk. It means that every heifer  
would calve or at least be given the opportunity  to do so. 
I asked my colleague  Andy  Conway^®  to work out what this means  
in terms of numbers.  Remember  that a single  suckling  herd of say 
1,000 cows will yield annually  450 bullocks,  300 maiden  heifers  
and 150 culled cows assuming  15% replacement  and 10% 
mortality.  Combining  single suckling  and once-bred  heifer  systems  
the annual  yield of cattle for the base herd of 1,000 cows at full 
production  would  on Conway ’s figures  be 645 bullocks,  435 bred-  
heifers  and 150 culled cows. He has assumed  in these figures  that 
all heifers  would  calve but this is probably  counterbalanced  by the 
high mortality  figure (10%) which he used. Multiple  suckling 
the calves for the bred heifers  would require  another  16 to 20 
dairy cows per 100 bred-heifers  and this of course  would further  
increase  the potential  output.
You will recall that I said earlier  that non-castration  increases 
lean meat production  per animal  very considerably  (Table 20). 
This extra lean meat production  from  bulls is something  of supreme  
importance.  An estimate  of annual  bullock  slaughterings  in the 
country"  is about 320,000.  From that data I have shown  you that 
each one of these if kept entire would yield at least an extra  
20 kg of meat per animal,  assuming  that most of the steers are at 
least 500 kg at slaughter.  This represents  an extra yield of 640 M 
tons of meat. Taking  the data from Table 20 and taking  a price 
of 19p per lb. for carcass,  and therefore  at least 28p for lean 
meat,  we can estimate  that bulls would  give returns  of from £5 to 
£16 per head more than similarly  treated  steers. Indeed  it might  
be argued  that factories  could afford to give more for bull car­
casses  than for those from steers  because  there is less costs involved 
in removing  fat. You will recall (Tables  14 and 20) that the real 
difference  in bulls over steers comes in at the heavier  weights. 
In effect I am saying  that where  we are keeping  100 bullocks  at 
present,  90 or less bulls would produce  the same yield of meat at 
similar  feed costs and less processing  costs.
Bulls are an easy way of producing  really good yields of meat  
per animal.  New lights are shining  at last on their uses — in the 
factory  the cut-up trade is moving,  in the field mains electric  
fencing  is the answer to utilising  our grassland  by an efficient  
animal. I would not under-estimate  the importance  of animal  
breeding,  indeed  one must stress the lack of adequate  beef progeny  
and performance  testing  in this country.  However,  non-castration  
is a very easy, rapid way of increasing  meat production  without  
any major extra food costs. Factories  have an important  role to 
play in encouraging  bull beef production.
25
I suggested  earlier that the small man in calf rearing  should 
be multiple  or single suckling  and I could have added that he 
should have another  job outside  farming.  One would hope that 
some of these jobs would come from processing  meat and its 
ancillary  industries.  Processing  of all the meat produced  in the 
country  would provide  extensive  and much needed work. The 
spending  power of these extra workers  and their increased  con­
sumption  of agricultural  products  alone is interesting  to think  
about.
I must concede  that it is difficult  to organise  a sound  meat trade  
as long as the store trade exists in its present  form. However,  this 
store trade, in my opinion,  cannot  continue  indefinitely.  Firstly,  
we can not afford  to sell compensatory  growth  any longer.  Second ­
ly, it doesn ’t seem logical  to send a beast live by ship when in 
many instances  only about 30 per cent of it will be eaten as meat  
within  3 months.  Shipping  costs are just too great. I will not dwell 
further  on the possibilities  of the store trade, I will conclude  by 
suggesting  that a man of the calibre  of the late Edward  Richards  
Orpen would question  the logic of importing  phosphorus  at one 
end of the production  line and paying  again for its export  in the 
form  of bones  at the other  end.
Very many people,  particularly  at Grange,  helped me in tlie 
research  work I have described  in this paper, and in its prepar ­
ation. I would like to thank them sincerely  because  without  their  
co-operation  and enthusiasm  research  work on this scale would  not 
be possible.
I again thank the Edward  Richards  Orpen Memorial  Trust  
for inviting  me to give this lecture.

THE IRISH GRASSLAND  ASSOCIATION  was 
founded  in 1947 with the aim of promoting  the knowl ­
edge of grassland  production.
In 1961, the name of the Association  was modified,  
in recognition  of the fact that good grassland  husbandry  
is intimately  associated  with, and inseparable  from, good  
livestock  husbandry.
The Association  provides  an apportunity  for those 
interested  in modern  grassland  farming  to gather and 
interchange  views and ideas; it provides  a platform  for 
forward-looking  farmers  and scientists  to expound  their 
ideas;  it fosters  and encourages  research  into the produc ­
tion and utilisation  of grassland,  and it aims to co­
operate  with organisations  which has in common  the 
improvements  of grassland  farming.
If you or your organisation  would like to join the 
Irish Grassland  and Animal  Production  Association,  the 
Secretary,  An Foras Taluntais,  Creagh,  Ballinrobe,  Co. 
Mayo,  would  be pleased  to hear from you.

Editorial
This issue of the Journal brings together  all papers suitable for 
publication  up to and including  the Winter meeting  of November  
1969.
There is a current widespread  interest in beef production,  and a 
general  realization  of the considerable  scope for improvement  in beef 
output. It is therefore  not necessary  for the Editorial  Committee  to 
explain  the predominance  of papers  dealing  with aspects  of this topic.
It may occur to readers that several of the contributions  to this 
Volume  5 have appeared  in part elsewhere;  we are aware of this, and 
realize that what is highly topical is bound to be reported  by the 
farming  press soon after our meetings.  But we feel also that the 
recording  of the original  papers in full in the Journal  gives farmers,  
students  and others a permanent  and accessible  record of useful re­
ference  material.

Input/Output  Relationship  
in Irish Farming
by
M. W. Walker , B.Sc.Agric.,  H.Dip.Ed.
The title of this paper is, of course,  a sample  of the present  day trend  
towards  disguising  the simplest  concepts  in jargon.  This is in its own 
way one of the many restrictive  practices  currently  in vogue to keep 
people  uninformed,  and maintain  an aura of dignity  and mental  stature  
around  those in the know.
Occasionally,  however,  jargon has its uses, and the main one is 
brevity— that is, to explain  a fairly complex  concept  in a few words; 
and this is a case in point.
In any business,  and farming  is a business,  albeit one generally  sadly  
lacking  the benefit  of the application  of good business  principles,  it is 
the output which governs  the gross revenue  or receipts.  Thus in our 
context we talk about sales of milk, beef, sheep, beet, cereals or 
whatever.
Now just as in any other industry,  there are raw materials  needed  
as the basis from which the products  are derived.  The fact that here 
the products  are derived  biologically  as much as technologically  is of 
no basic or fundamental  importance.  Our farm is our factory  floor and 
calves,  lambs,  seeds,  etc. are the raw materials  we fashion  into output.
In order to fashion  a calf into a bullock  fit for slaughter,  or seed 
wheat into next year ’s crop, many steps have to be taken and many 
expenses  incurred.  These are the inputs, and of course a relationship  
exists between  input and the output it engenders.
My company,  as you all know, is concerned  in one of the inputs 
needed for all land-using  enterprises —one of the inputs which is a 
major item of variable,  or direct, cost on any progressive  farm. It is 
not, therefore,  unusual  that we are keenly  concerned  in the relationship  
between  inputs and outputs  in Irish farming.
To be in a position  to judge this relationship  at achievable  level,  
rather than at presently  achieved  or average  level, a farm costing  and 
development  scheme  was inaugurated  some years ago, so that at present 
we are costing  and planning  development  on a total of over 100 farms  
throughout  the country.  We did not choose  special  farms but we choose 
special  farmers —those who were discontents  but prepared  to seek and 
find physical  and financial  advice;  and when they had it to act upon 
it as it affected their own peculiar  circumstances.  Thus we have a 
biased sample with whom we work, and so it is that we view our 
work as complementary  to the excellent  work of the appropriate  
divisions  within the Institute  and the Department  of Agriculture.
To arrive at the input/output  relationship  for any enterprise  it 
must be costed; and it must be costed on the Gross Margin  System  
where each enterprise  is costed separately.  Only thus can accurate  
input and output  figures be obtained.
For this purpose  the Fixed or Overhead  Costs are ignored  due to 
their difficulty  of allocation.  Thus rates, rent, permanent  labour,  
machinery  depreciation  and running costs, electricity,  ’phone, and 
water charges,  if any, are left on one side, and only the direct or 
variable  costs, which relate directly,  and which vary in amount  with 
the size of the enterprise,  are taken into account.
Cash crops are easy to deal with since it is a simple  case of so many  
acres yielding  so much crop with a sale value of whatever  it comes to. 
In the case of cereal crops the straw value may be included  or 
excluded  as you wish. In the case of sugar-beet  the leaf value for 
fodder is generally  disregarded  if fed at home but can be included  if 
they are actually  sold. Pea haulm is another  case in point. However,  
whatever  you decide it is an easy matter to arrive at an output value 
per acre. The inputs associated  with cash crops are seed, fertiliser,  
sprays,  contractors ’ charges,  casual labour costs, baler twine, etc. If 
you do all your own tillage operations  these are accounted  for in 
machinery  costs in the Fixed Cost section of your accounts.
With regard to the input/output  relationship  for arable cash crops  
it is simply  a question  of seeing that adequate  but not excessive  costs 
are incurred.  It is fairly well-known  for instance  how much fertiliser  
and seed are needed for optimum  yield. To use less than these re­
commended  inputs is to accept reduced  yields; to use grossly  more is 
to ask for trouble.  However,  even in such a straight-forward  situation  
some form of comparator  is useful and to this end we have combined  
experience  from all our Costed Farms to provide a set of Farm  
Planning  Standards.  These give a fair idea of the input/output  
relationship  and any farmer ’s own results and costs can be compared  
with this norm. Thus if your yield is lower than standard  you can 
study your inputs as compared  with standard  inputs and some varia ­
tion, if found, may account  for the discrepancy.  If inputs are normal  
you must look further  for the cause of the trouble.  Lime status and 
plant disease  are two factors  that spring to mind immediately.
If we examine  the common  agricultural  cash crops in Table 1 we 
see that for the given yields of crop, as expected  under standard  
conditions,  the cereals fall into the financial  order of superiority  of 
Gross Margin  per acre as follows:
1. Spring Wheat ..........................  £47.4  per acre
2. Malting  Barley ......................  £34.9 per acre
3. Feed Barley ..............................  £28.9  per acre
4 Oats ..........................................  £27.0  per acre
7
In all cases a yield of 1 ton of straw per acre is included  valued 
at £2 per ton except  oaten straw which was valued at £4 per ton.
A point to note is that no contractor ’s charges  have been included 
since as mentioned  previously  one’s own machinery  charges  appear  in 
fixed costs and, therefore,  for comparison  purposes  no contract  or 
casual labour charges are included.  These are, however,  direct or 
variable  costs and if they apply in your individual  case they must be 
deducted  to arrive at your own Gross Margin.
The other two common  cash crops are sugar beet and potatoes  as 
shown in tables 2 and 3. Again if we ignore contract  and casual  
labour  charges,  since these crops can be handled  in so many ways, for 
the standard  yields we expect Gross Margins  of £94.1 per acre from  
sugar beet, and £65 per acre from potatoes.  It may be interesting  for 
cash customers  to note that the direct or variable  costs are in con­
trasting  order of magnitude —£55 per acre for potatoes  and £24.5 per 
acre for sugar beet.
So far Gross Margin  Standards  have given us a means of comparing  
individual  with standard  inputs and outputs.  When their value in this 
direction  has been exhausted  they fulfil a second more important  
function  in the field of farm business  planning.  Just as most businesses  
have a “product-mix ”, so we have in farming  in most cases, and our 
aim should  be to choose  the most profitable  product-mix  that conforms  
to the various  constraints  that circumstances  force upon us.
In its simplest  terms a farmer should theoretically  maximise  his 
tillage acreage in descending  order of choice from sugar beet, to 
potatoes,  to wheat,  to malting  barley,  to feed barley,  to oats. However, 
he must consider  such constraints  as, availability  of contract,  availa ­
bility of casual labour,  availability  of satisfactory  contractor  services,  
risk, personal  choice, market  facilities,  sound rotational  practice,  etc. 
All these and more will play their part in determining  the eventual 
tillage product-mix.
If we move on now with, I hope, a clearer  knowledge  of terminology 
and direction  of energies,  to the livestock  enterprises  we shall find 
that a more complex  scene confronts  us. I will confine  my remarks  
to grazing  livestock  since non-land-using  enterprises  have not the same  
vital interest  for us, and the scale of operation  depends  on choice  and 
capital  availability,  rather than on Gross Margin  per acre.
The livestock  unit reminds  me rather of the recently  announced  
Ford Capri. It can be put together  in many different  ways and then 
“custom-planned ” to suit your own particular  farm business  or way 
of life.
Basically  though,  as is shown by Fig. 1, it is the rate at which you 
stock your livestock  units that governs  the Gross Margin per acre 
return. If there is a profit from a beast then there is more profit from  
two, and if you can keep two beasts where one stood before your

Fig. 1: Correlation  between  stocking  rate and gross margin  per forage acre
(Dairy  Cows 1967)
gross margin  is almost  doubled  per acre. Of course,  there will be some 
extra direct or variable  costs, but in most cases, in the short-term,  
there will be little or no change  in fixed or overhead  cost structure.  
The effect on profit per acre is shown in Table 4.
The categories  of grazing  livestock  that we have investigated  are as 
follows : dairy cows for creamery  and liquid Consumption;  dairy young 
stock; beef cattle; and breeding  sheep. Some small experience  was 
gained in single suckling.
In the case of the dairy cow her output consists  of the sale value  
of her milk and her calf less her share of herd depreciation,  which 
may amount  to as much as £8 or £12 per cow. Thus the output  of a 
cow varies from year to year depending  on the sale price of calves  and 
her milk yield. Milk yield varies by calving  date and feeding  regime
9
and by lactation  number,  but basically  the inherent  capacity  to produce  
milk is innate and as such can only be varied within limits by the 
above factors.
Thus the output per cow is dependent  on her inherent  capacity  to 
produce  milk—the price of her calf and depreciation  are largely out 
of the farmer ’s control.
If we refer to Table 5 we will see that for creamery  cows the output  
can very between  £77.5 and £99.7 for a 200 gallon variation  in milk 
yield between  600 and 800 gallons  taking a price of 2/5d. per gallon.
Now let us look at the cost inputs which are associated  with 
generating  this output.  For a 600 gallon cow on 1.7 acres per livestock 
unit the inputs amount to £22.2 and for an 800 gallon cow they 
amount  to £27.3. Thus the higher yielding  cow shows an increased 
Gross Margin  of £17.1 for no extra eflfort on the farmer ’s part. This 
indicates  clearly  the importance  of yield per cow.
If we now examine  the effect of stocking  rate we can see that to 
increase  stocking  rate from 1.7 to 1.2 acres per livestock  unit, the extra  
input costs incurred  are only in the region of £2. However,  allowing 
for this extra variable  cost, the Gross Margin per acre goes up hy 
almost  £12. What does this mean for the farmer?  It means  that a herd 
of 20 cows can be kept on 24 instead of 34 acres. The 10 acres 
released  can be utilised by some other livestock  or tillage enterprise,  
or the cow herd can be expanded  to 28 on the same acreage.  The 
extra Gross Margin  on 34 acres would be just over £400. Even if he 
has to buy 8 cows at £100 each his return is 50% on the outlay and 
he is working  into more stock for sale from his dairy young stock or 
beef fattening  enterprises.  If he could fit the 10 acres into his arable  
rotation  he could make an increased  Gross Margin of £500, but as 
we have already pointed out this does not allow for contractor  or 
casual labour charges  which would reduce this figure. However,  there  
would he no capital investment  in cows. This is where the farmer  
must choose, bearing in mind risk, personal  choice and any other  
relevant  factors, such as availability  of capital, housing  limitations,  
etc.
A brief run through  Table 6 on dairy cows producing  milk for 
liquid consumption  will show that inputs per cow range between  
£31.5 and £36.5 per cow between  yields of 700 and 850 gallons.  At a 
stocking  rate of a cow to 1.4 acres the gross margin per acre ranges 
between  £52 and £62 at an average  price of 2/lOd. per gallon. By 
stocking  at 1.2 acres per cow and allowing  extra forage costs of £3.5 
this gross margin can be raised to £70 per acre for an 850 gallon 
cow.
Table 7 for beef cattle will show the gross margin  per acre achieved  
from overwintering  and summer  grazing  systems.  You may argue with 
the prices per cwt. and the liveweight  gains as set out, but by making
10
your own alterations  you can use this as a blueprint  for your own 
particular  case.
Table 8 on breeding  ewes indicates  that the gross margin per ewe 
is about £5.5 and if stocked  at 3^ per acre this represents  over £19 
per acre gross margin.  This is a most attractive  return on capital.
Table 9 is, 1 think, of considerable  interest.  It concerns  the sort of 
gross margin  one could expect  from intensive  beef rearing  and feeding. 
Again you may argue with the figures,  but these are actual. If cost of 
calves seems low, so too does the sale value at that weight. The 
difference— the output —is about right. This enterprise  could prove  
most attractive  to anyone  who had intensified  his dairy herd to raise  
gross margin per acre, and who was looking  for a profitable  grazing  
livestock  enterprise  to absorb  the released  acres. It has the advantage  
that in many cases the calves are available  on the farm. Thus capital  
is not needed —one simply has to forego the immediate  cash income 
from sale of calves. However,  once the scheme  is in operation,  cash 
flow is unimpaired.  Even if capital is needed it should not be much  
more expensive  to stock with calves than with cows and housing  and 
handling  costs would probably  be less.
In the time available  I have tried to cover the main farming  enter ­
prises and to give, particularly,  some idea of how to go about examing  
the input/output  relationships  on your own farms. So many factors  
govern  the eventual  choice of programme  on any individual  farm that 
specific  information  is impossible.  I would suggest  however  that with 
the aid of standard  gross margins  you could plan your own input/  
output relationships.  When a pattern has been chosen the fixed and 
working  capital positions  can be determined  and the expected  return  
on capital  can be forecast  with some degree of accuracy.

“Beef Performance  
and Profitability ”
by
Dr. H. K. Baker
Deputy  Director  (Livestock)  Meat and Livestock  Commission
Sources  of U.K. Beef
The United  Kingdom ’s farmers  produce  £300 million  worth of beef per 
annum.  This represents  about three-quarters  of our total beef require ­
ment. The total consumption  of beef is about 1,200,000  tons, of which  
some 900,000  tons are home produced.  The annual consumption  per 
head of beef is just under 50 pounds.  Beef consumption  does however  
fluctuate.  Thus from 1963 to 1965 the average  annual  consumption  per 
head dropped  by 18 per cent from 53 to 44 lb. This decrease  was made  
up by increased  consumption  of poultry  and pig meat, but the con­
sumption  of beef has risen again since 1965.
The national  breeding  herd consists  of about 3,200,000  dairy cows  
and 1,200,000  beef cows. In addition,  between  500,000  and 750,000  
live store cattle are imported  annually  from Ireland  for fattening.
At the moment  just over 40 per cent of our home-produced  beef 
comes  from dairy herd calves  and about  20 per cent from suckler  calves. 
In addition,  17 per cent comes from imported  Irish store cattle. The 
remainder  is made up of slaughtered  culled breeding  cows.
The most important  single source of supply is the by-product  calves 
of the national  dairy herd. The majority  of these are either pure bred 
Friesian  male calves or beef cross Friesian  male and female calves. 
About one third of the national  dairy herd consists  of Ayrshire  and 
Channel  Island cattle. Most of these calves have in the past been 
slaughtered  at birth although  more of these cows, not required  for 
breeding,  are now crossed with the Charolais  through the use of 
Artificial  Insemination.  These cross-bred  calves from the lighter dairy  
breeds  are usually  reared under intensive  feeding  systems.
Approximately  one fifth of our beef comes from the commercial  
suckler  herds and there has been an overall  expansion  in these herds  
during  the 1960s.
In 1967, 3,592,000  cattle were slaughtered  for beef. Even a small 
improvement  in profitability  or meat yield per animal can therefore  
have a major effect both on the overall  farm Income  and on the total 
amount  of beef which is produced  in the United Kingdom.
19
Recording
In the United Kingdonr  feed accounts  for at least two-thirds  of the 
cost of producing  the final beef carcase  and in all our beef systems  
there is a close relationship  between  daily liveweight  gain, the efficiency  
of food conversion,  the food cost per pound of liveweight  gain and the 
overall  profitability.  Thus even within  the same type of beef production  
system  the feed costs per pound of liveweight  gain will range from 1/- 
to over 4/-. This indicates  the wide range in efficiency  which exists 
within  beef enterprises  and also highlights  the scope for improvement.
British  farmers  have become  far more cost conscious  in the past few 
years. Individual  farm enterprises  have been more carefully  costed and 
this has emphasised  to farmers  the low levels of profitability  in beef 
production  generally  and in the traditional  beef system in particular.  
In addition,  the relationship  between  performance  and profitability  is 
being recognised.  As a result of this, there has been a marked  swing  
to more intensive  methods  of production  and more cattle are now being  
slaughtered  before two years of age.
Within  all commercial  beef enterprises  there is a close relationship  
between  performance  and profitability.  Beef recording  on commercial  
farms can be used as an aid to management  and as an indicator  of the 
target  levels of performance  which must be achieved  within  the different  
systems  if beef production  is to be profitable.
The potential  for growth  of beef cattle is strongly  inherited  and this 
means that the development  of recording  schemes  for pedigree  cattle  
will provide  an important  method  of selecting  future breeding  material.
The B.R.A.  was established  in 1964 to encourage  and develop  all 
aspects  of beef recording  and improvement.  In October  1968 the newly  
constituted  Meat and Livestock  Commission  assumed  responsibility  
for livestock  improvement  work in Great Britain  on beef cattle, pigs 
and sheep.  Altogether  about 1,700 beef producers  and breeders  are now 
recording  with the MLC.
On-the-farm  pedigree  recording  schemes
On-the-farm  recording  schemes  are operated  for all beef and several  of 
the dual purpose  breeds.  The scheme  involves  weighing  cattle to obtain  
weights  at predetermined  ages, e.g. 200, 300, 400 and 500 days. Over  
40,000 pedigree  weight  records  are being handled  per annum  and over 
40 per cent of beef bulls licensed  now have authenticated  weight for 
age information.
20
Each of the breed recording  schemes  provides  data which indicate,  
under the breeds ’ normal  conditions  of rearing,  the average  level of 
breed performance  and the range within herds. When sufficient  data 
have been accumulated  it is possible  to identify  the overall effect of 
season of birth, age of dam, sex of calf, and level of rearing  on per­
formance.  This information  is valuable  when comparing  groups of 
progeny  from different  sires within a single herd. The combination  of 
calf type within each group (e.g. from young or old cows and of 
different  sex) can be corrected  to a standard  calf. This enables  a more  
realistic  comparison  to be made of the progeny  groups.
The data which have been collected  in this country  over the past 
three or four years have enabled the contemporary  comparisons  of 
progeny  within pedigree  herds. These results have shown that sires 
which are 100 lb. above the herd average  weight at 400 days are 
producing  progeny  which  are on average  22 lb. above  the weight  of their  
contemporaries  at 400 days. This gives a heritability  value of 44 per 
cent—very similar to the results which have been obtained  over the 
past two or three decades  in North  America.
On-the-farm  recording  has emphasised  the wide range in performance  
that exists both within and between  breeds.  The following  table shows 
the range that exists in the recorded  weights of pedigree  Hereford  
cattle :

The variation  in performance  is so great that even in two distinct  
breeds like the South Devon and Angus there is a complete  overlap  
of performance.  The breeds 400 day average  weights  are 1,150 and 
915 lb. but within the breeds the weights range from 700 lb. to 
1,445 lb. and from 630 lb. to 1,250 lb. respectively.  Obviously  both 
management  and genetic  factors  contribute  to variations  from herd to 
herd. But even within single herds the 400 day weights  have varied by 
over 3 cwt. for bulls kept under similar  managements.
It is of course  the need to provide  better comparisons  between  bulls  
from different  herds that has led to the establishment  of central  testing 
stations.
Central  Performance  Testing
The MLC are currently  operating  five central bull testing stations  
with a total throughput  of 300 bulls. These are:
Centre
Aberdeen  
Dartington,  Devon  
Harrogate
Holme  Lacy, Herefordshire  
Stoneleigh,  WarwickshireBreed
Aberdeen  Angus  
South Devon  
Hereford  and Charolais  
Hereford
Devon,  Lincoln  Red and Sussex
The bulls are taken into the centres  at approximately  seven months  
of age. They are currently  on test for six months  and the criteria  of 
performance  is weight  for age at 400 days, i.e. 13 months  of age.
It must be stressed  that the whole test is a period of adjustment  to 
balance  out differences  in pre-weaning  management  and for this reason 
the liveweight  gain during  test is not taken into account.  The relative 
ranking  of the bulls in terms of weight for age shows considerable  
variation  during the first 4 or 5 months but is relatively  consistent 
during  the last four to six weeks.
The tests have emphasised  the very wide range in performance,  
over 3 cwt. at 400 days of age, which exists within a single breed even 
when management  conditions  are equalised:

Central  testing  has been useful in highlighting  the differences  which 
exist within  a breed— and this has been done by having  a representative  
cross section  of the breed on test. In order to achieve  the maxinium  
return  from central  testing  it will however  become  increasingly  important  
to ensure  that there is adequate  pre-selection  of bulls before  coming  onto 
test so that only the potentially  best bulls are being centrally  tested.  
This has already  been started by imposing  a minimum  weight  for age 
before  bulls can be considered  for testing.
Fortunately  there is no antagonism  between  selection  for growth  and 
the potential  for meat production  in the commercial  animal.  Thus there  
has been no correlation  between  conformation  (as judged  by breeders)  
and performance  at the end of the performance  test so that selection 
for performance  need not result in adverse conformation  changes.  
There is also experimental  evidence  which indicates  that within  a single  
breed, or type of beef animal, the animals  which grow faster will 
produce  a better type of carcase  with a greater  eye muscle  area and a 
lower proportion  of fat.
On current  tests there has been good correlations  between  growth  
rate and feed efficiency  and it has generally  been assumed  that the 
quickest  growing  animals  will have the best feed conversion  from birth  
to slaughter.
However,  as testing  in the future concentrates  on the animals  which 
are all well above average  performance  it may become  necessary  to re­
examine  the feed conversion  efficiency  of individual  animals.  It is likely 
that within breeds the rate of maturity  and hence type of carcase  pro­
duced will be directly  related  to feed conversion  efficiency.
Experimentation  is at present  under way to study the effect of feeding  
single diets in the form of pellets made from chopped  roughage  and 
concentrate.  If diets of this type prove successful  it will be possible  to 
consider  ‘ad lib’ feeding  of a single diet; this could add considerably  
to the accuracy  of the tests. It would also enable  consideration  of group  
housing  of bulls on test and this could in the long term simplify  manage ­
ment and reduce  costs.
2f
The future  development  of central  testing  must be closely  linked with 
on-the-farm  recording  of herds. These herd records  are essential  for the 
meaningful  selection  of bulls for testing and ultimately  it may be 
desirable  to test centrally  groups  of 4 or 5 half-brothers  from a single  
herd. This is already  being done in Canada  and would obviously  add 
greatly to inter-herd  comparisons.
Progeny  testing
Compared  with performance  testing,  progeny  testing is slow and rela­
tively expensive.  However,  it can give a more precise  estimate  of a bulls  
breeding  value for gain. Also it allows  an assessment  of carcase  charac ­
teristics  which is not yet possible  in the live bull during  a performance  
test. For these reasons  progeny  testing  can be justified  on a cost/return  
basis when large numbers  of offspring  are sired through  the use of A.l. 
Thus even if a progeny  evaluated  bull only increases  the average  per­
formance  of his progeny  by 0.05 lb. per day, if he is used to produce  
15,000  calves  the extra profit resulting  from these calves  should be over 
£20,000 .
The British  Milk Marketing  Boards  and the independent  A.l. centres  
have already  announced  their interest  in purchasing  high performance  
bulls —if possible  from central  testing  stations.  These organisations  also 
appreciate  the importance  of progeny  testing  their beef stud as well as 
their dairy bulls in order to add precision  to their original  selection.  
The Milk Marketing  Boards have established  Warren  Farm as their 
central  progeny  testing  station  where  their teams of purchased  bulls are 
finally  evaluated.
The MFC is also developing  a scheme  of progeny  testing for beef 
bulls standing  at the Independent  A.l. centres.  This is similar to the 
Warren  Farm concept  except  that once the progeny  have been brought  
together  as calves and have been early weaned  they will be reared in 
matched  groups  on commercial  farms.
Commercial  Recording
Three basic types of commercial  recording  are carried  out by the MLC.
(i) Weight  Recording
In this scheme  the commerical  beef breeders  use the MFC ’s mobile 
weighing  machines  and within a few days they are given the daily live- 
weight gain of each animal,  the average  gain of each group and the 
average  gain of different  sexes or crosses  within  the groups.
(ii) Weight  and feed recording
Farmers  are encouraged  to keep records  of feed consumption  so that 
when the weight  records  are returned  to the farm they are also given the 
food cost per pound of liveweight  gain. The range in feed costs, even 
in the same type of beef enterprise  is enormous,  and quite commonly  
will range from 1/- to 4/- per pound of liveweight  gain.
24
(iii) Study Groups
The main objective  in commercial  beef recording  is to encourage  
farmers  to join study groups.  Each study group consists  of 8 to 15 
producers  and is based on a single  type of beef production,  e.g. intensive  
cereal beef, semi-intensive  grass beef or commercial  suckler  calf pro­
duction.
Physical  and financial  targets are prepared  for each type of study  
group. These are based on both the results achieved  at Research  and 
Experimental  Husbandry  Earms and on the results  obtained  on mem ­
bers ’ farms.  Gross  margin  costings  are used throughout  as these provide  
the fairest basis for overall  comparisons  over a wide scale where both 
financial  and physical  comparisons  are involved.
Study Groups  form focal points  for the exchange  of information  and 
advice between  the participating  farmers,  advisory  services,  research  
establishments,  experimental  husbandry  farms and the MLC.
Intensive  cereal beef production
This system  normally  involves  pure Friesian  steers which receive  high 
concentrate  feeding  and the system  does not include  any grazing.  The 
feed is usually  based on barley (supplemented  by protein  concentrate),  
although  there are often differences  in the type of cereal  and in the pro­
tein balance.  The roughage  feeding  is not normally  more than 2 lb. dry 
matter  per head per day. The concentrate  may either be fed ad lib or 
restricted.
Using data from research,  experimental  husbandry  farms and from  
recording  farms, the MLC has developed  both physical  and financial 
targets.  These,  together  with results  from farms,  are given in Table 3:

The above table shows the wide range which exists in the overall  
daily gain and in the gross margin  per head between  different  enterprises  
practising  this relatively  simple  type of beef production.
25
Semi-intensive  grass/cereal  beef
During  the past few years there have been considerable  advances  in the 
development  of beef production  from grassland.  Research  work has 
shown how intensifying  both the output  per animal  and per acre could 
give an extremely  efficient  system  of beef production.
Normally,  autumn  born Friesian  steers or Beef cross Friesian  steers 
and heifers  are used in the system.  The cattle have at least one season 
at grass, are slaughtered  at 16 to 22 months  of age at a liveweight  of 
between  580 and 1100 lbs. To achieve  the required  weights  the animals  
should  have an overall  average  daily liveweight  gain of 1.8 lb. per head 
from birth to slaughter.
The calves are reared indoors  during  the first winter  and turned out 
to grass in the spring at about 400 lb. liveweight.  During  the grazing 
season the target is to obtain a daily liveweight  gain of 2 lb. from  
grazing  alone at a stocking  rate of between  1 ^ and 2 cattle per acre. 
The cattle are grazed on a rotational  system around paddocks.  The 
grass should  be no more than 3 to 4 weeks  old when grazed,  and topping  
rejected  herbage  should  be adopted  during  the latter part of the grazing 
season.
Up to 300 lb. of nitrogen  are applied  per acre and surplus  grass is 
conserved  as silage or hay. Cattle  are brought  indoors  during  the winter  
and are fattened  on a combination  of the conserved  fodder  and no more 
than 6 lb. per head per day of cereal supplement.
The physical  and financial  targets for this type of production  are 
given in Table 4:

Range  of study  group  results 1.3 to 2.1 11 to 50 21 to 99
Top 4 of study  group  results 1.8 37 62
The above table again shows the wide range in farm results in both 
performance  and financial  returns.  As in the barley beef units about  
one third of the study group members  are achieving  the targets and 
several are comfortably  exceeding  the gross margin  target of £60 per 
acre. The best producers  are operating  a beef system  which is providing  
a useful alternative  to other forms of grassland  use in terms of gross 
margin  results.
26
The above results  have been obtained  from all over the country.  The 
range in results  is again very large, but there is no relationship  between 
geographical  distribution  of the results.  There is however  a close rela­
tionship  between  daily liveweight  gain, stocking  rate and the gross mar­
gin per acre and generally  the farms with the highest  liveweight  gain 
per acre have the highest  gross margins.
The most commonly  used types of calves in the semi-intensive  system 
are Hereford  cross Friesian  steers or Friesian  steer calves. All have 
been used successfully  in the system.  Other beef breed cross Friesian  
and Charolais  cross Ayrshire  calves have also been successfully  used in 
this system.
A contemporary  comparison  between  pure Friesian  steers and Here ­
ford cross Friesian  steers has shown  that throughout  the grazing  season 
the Hereford  cross will average  just over 0.2 lb. extra liveweight  gain 
per day when compared  with pure Friesian  steers. The earlier matur ­
ing beef cross seems to have greater  resistance  to adverse  conditions  
such as cold, wet weather,  or parasitic  infection,  and it is during  these 
periods  that the greatest  difference  is noted between  the two types of 
cattle.
Commercial  suckler  calf production
There are over one million  suckler  cows in the United Kingdom— yet 
until the early 1960s there had been no experimental  husbandry  work  
on systems  involving  this type of beef production.  There is certainly  
no place in the lowlands  for the traditional  extensive  system  where a 
traditional  beef type cow (with a low milk yield) produced  on average  
less than a calf a year, needed  2 acres or more pter cow and where the 
calf grew at no more than 1 j lb. per day. However,  new evidence  and 
experience  is suggesting  that, particularly  on arable farms in the East 
and the South,  there may well be a place for a new type of suckler  cow 
herd.
The cow will be a beef cross Friesian  (or dual purpose  type) and 
will have sufficient  milk to support  a calf growing  at 2 to 2^ lb. per 
day. High growth  rate beef bulls will be used as the final cross to give 
calves with a high growth  potential  and with the capacity  to finish on 
relatively  low concentrate  diets. The cows will need to be over-wintered  
as cheaply  as possible  on rations  based on straw and other arable by­
products,  possibly  supplemented  with urea. If stocked at a cow, or 
more, to the acre during  the grazing  season  it is possible  to achieve  the 
target gross margin  of £40 per cow and £30 per acre.
More information  is needed on the best dates for calving,  levels of 
supplementary  feeding,  etc. but already  results  from recorded  commer ­
cial farms are providing  valuable  information  in this direction.  As in 
the other forms  of beef production  there are wide ranges  in performance  
and profitability —but the enterprises  in which the calves have the best
27
daily gains also have the best gross margin  results. These results are 
indicating  that worthwhile  productive  systems  can be developed  for 
intensive  suckler  calf production  on lowland  arable  farms.
Results  from commercial  farms are showing  wide ditferences  in per­
formance  both within  and between  herds. Within  the single breed types 
daily liveweight  gains can vary by as much as 2 lb. per head (e.g. from  
0.9 to 2.9 lb. per day). There is thus enormous  scope for overall  
improvement.  It is essential  that calves should  grow quickly  when they 
are suckling  their dams and that they do not mature too early and 
hence still continue  to grow during  the post-weaning  period.
MLC ’s overall  programme
The MLC ’s plans for beef recording  are based on developing  a co­
ordinated  programme  which  will link together  the pedigree  breeder  and 
the commercial  producer.
On-the-farm  pedigree  recording  schemes  will form the base-line  of the 
breed improvement  programmes.  From these will be selected  the best 
bulls for central  testing.  The best of the centrally  tested bulls will be 
progeny  evaluated  to select the nucleus  for A.l. and it is hoped that 
eventually  these superior  bulls may also have a significant  influence  on 
the breeding  programmes  within pedigree  breeds.
Commercial  recording  will continue  to highlight  the range of com­
mercial  results and the relationship  between  performance  and profit ­
ability. The MLC will wish to record sufficient  commercial  farms to 
continuously  assess the effects  that the breed improvement  programmes  
are having.  The study groups  will also play a useful role in evaluating  
progeny  both from tested bulls within a breed and in evaluating  
different  breeds  and crosses  in different  systems.
Finally,  it is intended  that the commercial  recording  in study groups  
and the progeny  evaluation  work will be linked with the carcase  
classification  work of the Commission  so that there will be a complete  
link from the breeding  work —through  commercial  production —to the 
consumer.
Intensification  of 
Single Suckling
by
M. J. Drennan
The Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
In the past the great majority  of our beef animals  were obtained  from  
dairy herds. During  the last few years problems  have been encountered  
in the export of dairy products.  In general,  the international  markets  
for dairy products  is seriously  depressed  and sales in export markets  
require  heavy subsidies.  The Government  have recently  introduced  a 
beef cattle incentive  scheme  the purpose  of which is to expand  beef 
production  without  at the same time increasing  commercial  milk pro­
duction  (1). Thus, it is unlikely  that in the future,  the supply  of calves 
from our dairy herds will be sufficient  to meet the demand  for beef 
animals  and other sources  of beef calves  will be required.  For this reason,  
information  on single suckling  as a potential  source of beef merited  
investigation.
Single suckling  is often referred  to as been biologically  in-efficient.  
Results  from the British  Grassland  Research  Institute  at Hurley  (2) and 
(3) would indicate,  however,  that single sucklers  are at least as efficient  
as sheep when efficiency  is measured  as pounds  of carcass  produced  per 
100 pounds  of digestible  organic  matter consumed.  When compared  
with dairying,  single suckling  is not as efficient  in the conversion  of 
animal  feed to human  food.
Efficiency  may be defined  in various  ways but one of the more useful 
from our point of view would be in terms of pounds  of carcass  (or to 
be more precise,  lean meat) produced  per unit area of land. Thus, in 
investigating  single suckling  as a potential  source of beef we want to 
look at factors  which might influence  its efficiency  as defined  above.
Increased  output  could arise through;
(1) increased  summer  stocking  rate.
(2) Improved  calf performance,  and
(3) Cheaper  feeding  of cows in winter.
At Grange the effects of summer  stocking  rates and some other  
factors  which might influence  calf performance  are being investigated.
29
Summer  Stocking  Rate
The animals  were stocked  at 1.0 (low), 1.5 (medium)  and 2.0 (high)  
cows and their calves per acre for the grazing  season  on grass  white  elover  
pasture  during  the years 1966 to 1968 inclusive.  The pastures  received 
3 cwt. of superphosphate,  1 cwt. of muriate  of potash and 2 cwt of 
calcium  ammonium  nitrate per acre each year. The cows and calves 
were rotationally  grazed around six equally  sized paddocks.  Animals  
were moved to the next plot when, by visual accessment,  those at the 
high stocking  rate were short of grass. The animals  were removed  from  
their treatments  each year when the calves at the high stocking  rate 
ceased  making  further  liveweight  gains. Hereford  cross cows and calves  
were u.sed during  the three years. There were eight cows and calves per 
treatment.
Calf liveweight  gains
1966—The  cows used were all first cal vers. The experiment  proper  did 
not commence  until June the 2nd. However,  the area was grazed from  
the start of the grazing  season.  The average  age of the calves  at the start 
of the experiment  was 31 days. There was a difference  in calf daily  
liveweight  gains when the whole season is taken into consideration  
(Table 1). This difference  is due to the poor performance  of the calves  
at the higher stocking  rates from early August until the end of the 
grazing  season,  when only those at the lower stocking  rate gained at a 
rate of 2.0 lb. daily. No difference  in calf performance  was noted in the 
period June to August  when those at all stocking  rates made average 
daily liveweight  gains of over two pounds.

}967—Mainly  first calving  animals  were again used as those from the 
previous  year were due to calve too late in the season.  The average  dates  
of birth for the calves  at the low, medium  and high stocking  rates were 
28th February,  the 1st and the 7th of March  respectively.
30
The daily gains of the calves differed  from the previous  year in that 
those stocked  at 2.0 per acre gained less than the other two groups  
during  the early part of the grazing  season (Table  2).
No difference  was found between  the low and medium  stocked  calves 
during this period.  From August  until the end of the grazing  season 
calf performance  was somewhat  similar  to that obtained  in the previous  
year with only those stocked  at the low rate gaining  over 2 pounds  
daily during  this period.

1968—The calves on average  were about 40 days old at the com­
mencement  of the grazing  season  on April 11.
Calf daily liveweight  gains followed  a somewhat  similar  trend to that 
obtained  in 1966 (Table 3). No difference  was found in calf per­
formance  between  any of the three stocking  rates during the period 
April to August.  As in the previous  two years increasing  the stocking  
rate from August  until the end of the season resulted  in reduced  calf 
gains. Only those at the low stocking  rate gained over two pounds  
daily during  this period.

Cow Liveweight  Changes
The liveweight  changes  of the cows at the various  stocking  rates followed 
a somewhat  similar trend during all three years. However  as the 
grazing  season  commenced  later in 1966 the magnitude  of the changes  
were not as great in that year. Table 4 shows the average  liveweight  
changes  for the cows during  the 1968 grazing  season.

Despite  the fact that no ditference  was obtained  in calf performance  
during  the period from April to August  1968, a difference  was found 
in cow performance.  The cows at the high stocking  rate gained 190 lb. 
rates gained  on average  63 lb. and 87 lb. more respectively.  During  the 
later part of the season large differences  in cow weight  changes  were  
obtained,  the cows at the high stocking  rate lost 116 lb. in bodyweight 
while those at the low stocking  rate gained  32 lb.
Effect of milk yield on calf performance
The milk yields of the cows were obtained  periodically  throughout  the 
grazing  season during all three years. Estimates  of milk yield were  
obtained  by separating  the calves from the cows and then weighing  
the calves  before  and after suckling.  A large variation  in milk yield was 
found between  cows within any one treatment.  Looking  at the 1966 
data when the variation  in calf age at weaning  was least and milk 
yield was estimated  more frequently  than in the other two years, a 
comparison  is made between  the average  performance  of the calves  from  
the four cows giving most milk in each treatment  and the calves from  
the four cows giving  least milk (Table  5). The milk yield estimates  were 
taken at two-week  intervals  commencing  on July 7.

The better milkers  had calves  which  gained  on average  at least 0.2 lb. 
more per day from birth to weaning  at about 170 days. This means  
an extra 36 pounds  at six months  of age. This response  to milk may not 
however  apply if the average  milk yield of the cows was higher than 
that found in the present  work but it does indicate  that a better  milking  
cow would be a decided  advantage  under those conditions.  It applies  
also for cows calving  earlier  in spring.  When  the same exercise  is under ­
taken for the 1968 data the response  in calf performance  to milk was 
found to be even greater  than that shown above. In 1968, older cows  
were used, their milk yields were higher and the average  calving  date 
was in early March. Results  elsewhere  (4, 5 and 6) also demonstrate  
that milk yield of the cow is a major  factor  influencing  calf performance.
Creep  grazing  for the calf
Work at Grange  has shown that in a rotational  grazing  system the 
digestibility  of the herbage  selected  by beef cattle on entering  a plot is 
much greater  than that selected  a couple  of days later as they leave the 
plot (7). Due to the high relationship  which exists between  digestibility  
and intake (8, 9) one would expect that calves allowed to forward  
creep graze ahead of the cows would obtain a greater  intake of diges-  
table nutrients.  This improved  intake  should  manifest  itself in improved  
calf performance.  In the stocking  rate work just outlined  a forward  creep  
for the calves to the plot ahead of the cows was investigated.  This 
investigation  was made at the medium  (1.5 cows and their calves per 
acre) stocking  rate only. Although  the trend was for the calves to gain 
slightly  better and the cows to make poorer  gains when compared  with 
the animals  not creep-grazed  at a similar  stocking  rate, the differences 
in calf performance  were not significant.  This investigation  is now 
being continued  in greater  detail.
33
Double  suckling
This was again investigated  at the medium  stocking  rate only. The 
same procedure  was adopted  as described  for the stocking  rate trial 
except that in this case the calves were suckled  twice daily and they 
grazed  the plot ahead of the cows. No adjustment  in stocking  rate was 
made for the extra calf.
Calf performance  was somewhat  similar  during  all three years. The 
data for 1968 is shown  with that of single suckled  calves stocked  at the 
same rate (Table  6).
Table  6

April II to August  1 2.3 1.8
August  I to September  24 1.6 0.9
The double sucklers  gained 1.5 lb. daily during the whole grazing 
season  compared  with a figure of 2.1 lb. per day for the single sucklers. 
A good performance  of 1.8 lb. daily liveweight  gain was obtained  with 
the double  sucklers  until August.  Thereafter,  the poor performance  can 
probably  be attributed  to scarcity  of grass.
Finishing  single  suckled  calves
As those calves have been reared on a high plane of nutrition  in early  
life their finishing  treatment  is not likely to be similar  to that of calves  
grown at a slower rate. Thus, an experiment  was designed  to obtain  
preliminary  information  on the finishing  of those calves.
Single suckled Hereford  X bullocks  were fed at three planes of 
nutrition  in winter and subsequently  grazed together  at pasture.  The 
animals  were slaughtered  on reaching  1,000 lb. liveweight.  Silage was 
fed at libitum  to the three groups  in winter  and different  levels of con­
centrates  to the two higher  plane groups  (Table?).
The calves were about 630 pounds  liveweight  at the beginning  of 
winter.

c. 90 percent  rolled  barley  and 10 percent  soya bean meal.
As can be seen from the performance  of the low plane group that 
received  silage only, the quality of the silage was poor (Table 8). 
However,  the response  to meal was quite good, an extra 0.22 lb. daily  
liveweight  gain per pound of meals fed was obtained  at the lower level  
of meal feeding.

time they were let out to pasture  on April 12 to July 3. During  the same  
period the daily gains of the medium  and low plane groups  was 1.9 and 
2.8 lb. respectively.  The poor performance  of the animals  wintered  at 
the high plane of nutrition  on letting out to pasture  would tend to 
suggest  that those animals  when fed on a high plane of nutrition  from  
birth tend to mature  at too low a weight.  Thus, a breed or cross with 
a greater  growth  potential,  which matures  at a greater  weight would  
appear  to be beneficial.  However,  the hot carcass  weight  was greater  for 
the group wintered  on the high plane of nutrition  and thus it would  
appear that liveweight  gains may not have been a true reflection  of 
carcass  gains.

The number  of days from April 12 to slaughter  at 1,000 lb. was 
122, 154 and 178 days for those wintered  at the high, medium  and low 
plane of nutrition  respectively.
Future  targets
The objective  is to feed one cow and her calf to about a year on 1 
acre of pasture  plus some meals for the calf in winter  (Table 10). From  
the information  already  obtained  one can conclude  that it is possible  
to get good calf performance  at stocking  rates of up to 2 cows and their 
calves per acre until August,  i.e. 1 cow and her calf on 0.5 acre. There ­
after, in order to maintain  calf daily gains at over 2.0 pounds the 
stocking  rate must be reduced  to about 1 cow and her calf per acre. 
From April to August  the extra ^ 4cre that is required  for the cow and 
calf unit later in the season  can be cut twice for silage.

The two cuts of silage taken from the I acre should be sufficient  to 
meet the requirements  of the cow and the calf up to 1 year.
One should  aim at producing  a finished  animal  without  having  to let 
those yearlings  to pasture  for a second season.  However,  the weight  in 
April would  be too tow and so we hope to look at methods  of increasing  
the weight  attained  at this time. Some such factors  as breed of bull and 
breed of dam will be discussed  later during  the meeting —both of which 
would have a definite  role to play in increasing  calf performance.
36
The breed of cow would  be important  for two main reasons ;
(a) Milk yield which was shown to influence  calf performance,  and
(b) Imparting  greater  growth  potential  in the offspring.
At Grange,  Harte (10) has shown that bulls grow faster than steers,  
are more efficient  in the conversion  of feed to carcass  and have less fat 
in their carcasses.  Thus leaving  the males  entire is another  way in which 
improvement  in performance  of sucklers  could be brought  about. Of 
course,  one can always  increase  the weight  attained  at any fixed date by 
calving  earlier  but this will increase  the winter  feed requirement  of the 
cow.
However,  T feel that with a calving  date in January  and February  and 
using a good milking  dam and a bull which imparts  high growth  poten ­
tial in the offspring  a weight  of up to 1,000 pounds  could be attained  
for the uncastrated  males at 14-15 months  of age.

In 1963 the Land Commission  leased to the Agricultural  Institute  a 75- 
acre holding  at Ballintubber,  Co. Roscommon.  A field station was set 
up on this farm which is operated  from Grange.  When the farm was 
taken over the pastures  would be classified  as of extremely  poor quality.  
They had been used for summer  grazing  with cattle and as far as was 
known,  no lime or fertiliser  had been applied  in the previous  years. The 
internal  fences on the farm were quite inadequate  and about 40 per 
cent of the total area of the farm needed  drainage.
The Institute  decided  to use this farm to carry out research  work on 
animal-pasture  relationships.  Since the area is a traditional  cattle and 
sheep producing  one a farming  system of which there was very little 
information,  it was decided  that the work at Ballintubber  should be 
primarily  concerned  with this field. The following  questions  were there ­
fore set out;
1. What would the carrying  capacity  of this land be when developed 
in terms of cattle and sheep?
2. What sort of problems  would be encountered  at high stocking 
rates?
3. What would happen  to the performance  of cattle and sheep when  
grazed  together,  as compared  with being grazed  separately?
4. What changes  would occur in poor old permanent  pasture  when  
reasonable  inputs of fertiliser  are given and stock numbers  are 
increased?
The first phase of the development  of the farm was the removal  of the 
ditch fences and scrub, together  with drainage.  This reclamation  work 
was done over the winter  of 1963/64  but all the wet land could not be 
drained  due to a problem  with rock in one section.  The whole  farm was 
limed at the rate of 4 tons of ground  limestone  per acre in 1964. All 
areas where fences were removed  or where the pasture  was damaged  
were oversown  with {perennial  ryegrass  and white clover.
In the Spring  of 1964, 50 acres was selected  to lay out a trial to try 
and answer  some of the questions  set out above. This area did not 
include  the section  of the farm needing  drainage.
The selected  area was then divided  across  each soil type as follows:  
A—10 acres; B—15 acres; and C—25 acres.
38
The following  treatments  were then allocated  to these three units:
A—Fat Lamb Production  unit;
B—Cattle Production  Unit;
C—Cattle and Fat Lamb Production  Unit (mixed  stocking).
Each unit was divided  and fenced into 10 paddocks  of equal size. 
Each treatment  or unit was operated  on a farmlet  basis; all the feed for 
the animals  for the full year (apart from meals fed to the ewes before 
lambing  and to the cattle on silage) was grown within each unit. All 
units were rotationally  grazed.
In the fat lamb unit the ewes were mated in October  with Suffolk  
rams and the lambs were sold out in June, July and August.  In the 
cattle unit yearling  cattle were put out to graze in April and in 
November  they were put into the yards and were fed on silage.
Some meal was fed with the silage. The cattle were sold out when all 
the silage was eaten.
On the mixed stocking  unit the cattle grazed with ewes and lambs  
from April until weaning  in early July. Whenever  land was closed up 
for silage on either of the other two treatments,  an equal area was 
closed up on the mixed unit.
Since one of the objectives  was to a.scertain  the potential  of this land 
and since the sward had never been fertilised  previously,  it was quite  
obvious  that the sward would be improving  every year in terms of yield.  
For that reason  the stocking  rate has been increased  on all units each 
year as is shown in table 1.

There was a different  method  of operation  for each system.  In the 
case of the fat lamb unit, this was operated  on the Grange  system  as set 
out diagramatically  below:

In the early years the ewes were wintered  in one paddock  where they 
were fed silage. This worked  satisfactorily  but it was very muddy  in 
some years. During  the winter  of 1967/68  the ewes were wintered  on a 
sawdust  pad and again in 1968/69  and it is working  reasonably  well.  
When grass runs out the ewes are fed on silage until lambing.  Six weeks 
before lambing,  meal feeding  commences  at [ lb. per day, and this is 
gradually  increased  to 1 \ Ib./head/day  just prior to lambing.
The operation  of the cattle system  has changed  considerably  over the 
years as the stocking  rate has been built up. This applies  particularly  to 
the conservation  programme.  When the stocking  rate was low as in 
1965, it was necessary  only to take one cut of silage from half of the 
farm, but when the stocking  rate was high as in 1968, it was necessary  
to take two cuts of silage from part of the farm. One of the main  
problems  in operating  high stocking  rate systems  is the provision  of 
enough  grazing  and winter feed. In the cattle system as operated  in 
Ballintubber  this is an obvious  antagonism  and the provision  of both  
has to be very carefully  planned.  The operation  of the cattle system 
during  the grazing  season  of 1968 is set out diagramatically  as follows:

In February  a decision  is made as to which paddocks  will be for 
silage and which for grazing.  Nitrogen  is applied  only to the grazing  
paddocks  in February  and, is not applied  to the silage paddocks  until 
April. The work at Grange  has demonstrated  clearly  that it is possible 
to stock 4-42 cwt. cattle at the rate of three cattle per acre for the 
period April to August.  The stocking  rates must then be reduced  if 
high production  per animal  is to be obtained.  Translating  this into farm  
practice  means  that if portion  of a farm is stocked  at this rate that the 
remainder  can be cut twice for conservation  before  the end of July and 
from then onwards  the whole  farm is grazed.  This can be done provided  
that (1) soil fertility  is at a high level, (2) pastures  are rested over the 
winter,  and (3) grazing  does not start too early.
To implement  this system  of integrating  grazing  with conservation,  it 
is necessary  to do some simple  planning  early in the year. If the grazing 
animals  are short of feed there are two options ; (i) apply some nitrogen 
to the grazing  paddocks  or (ii) leave one of the silage paddocks  back for 
grazing.  At farm level the opposite  approach  is adopted  towards  inte­
gration of grazing  and conservation,  that is, all the farm is grazed 
early in the season and then it becomes  obvious  about mid-May  that 
there is surplus  grass on the farm so the decision  is made to close for 
silage. This silage will be cut towards  the end of June and since the 
grass will have flowered  it will be of lower feeding  value than May cut 
silage and it will not be possible  to get a second  cut by the end of July. 
Consequently,  the grazing  area is usually  understocked  in mid-summer  
and this necessitates  a considerable  amount  of topping.  Topping  is 
always  a good indicator  of low stocking  rate and poor pasture  manage ­
ment.

In our system,  the cattle stay on grass until November,  when they are 
brought  into yards and fed silage with 4 lb. rolled barley per head per 
day. They are sold when the silage is finished  which is usually  late 
February  or early March.
The operation  of the mixed system  is a combination  of both the fat 
lamb system  and the cattle system,  as can be seen from the diagram.  
For example  when the 1\ acre area is closed for silage in the cattle  
system  a similar  area is closed up in the mixed system,  and likewise  for 
the all-sheep  system.
The cattle for these units are reared on another  section  of the farm,  
and the system  of calf rearing  is similar  to that developed  by Dr. F. J. 
Harte at Grange;  i.e. 50 gallons  of milk substitute  fed on a calfeteria  
system  on grass with limited  feeding  of rolled barley.

The botanical  composition  and plant density  of the original  pasture  in 
1963 and its composition  after three years of fertiliser  application  and

The main species  in the original  sward was Agrostis  tenuis or bent 
grass which contributed  approximately  50 per cent, and sweet vernal  
contributed  18 per cent. The other five grass species  each contributed  
less than 7 per cent, their combined  contributon  being 16 per cent. 
The main legume  consisted  of white clover and this contributed  almost  
6 per cent to the composition  of the original  sward.
One of the first effects of stock and fertiliser  was to increase  the 
density  of the swards  by approximately  30 per cent and there was no 
difference  between  the three systems,  the Agrostis  species  were reduced  
from half of the original  sward to approximately  11 per cent after three  
years. Sweet vernal  was reduced  from 18 per cent in the original  sward 
to approximately  2 per cent. Weeds were reduced  from 10 per cent 
to approximately  2 per cent.
For the grasses  which improved  with fertilising  and management  the 
most spectacular  change was in the content  of rough stalk meadow  
grass which increased  from just over 2 per cent to almost  40 per cent 
in the cattle system  and to over 50 per cent in the other two systems.  
Crested  dogstail  increased,  particularly  on the all cattle treatment,  and 
the amount  of red fescue also increased.  There was very little change  
in the content  of perennial  ryegrass  but the amount  present  in the 
original  sward was less than 1 per cent. There has been practically  no 
change  in the clover content.

Animal  Production
The percentage  of lambs each year which were sold fat by weaning  is 
shown in table 3.
Every  vear there was an advantage  in terms of lamb growth  rate with 
mixed grazing.  Mixed  grazing  did not have any adverse  effect on cattle  
liveweight  gain, and in fact the liveweight  gains were higher  on mixed 
grazing  every year except 1964. The performance  of the cattle on 
summer  grazing  has been fairly consistent  except  in 1966/67.  It will be 
noted that the liveweight  gains during winter have been improving  
(Table 4). This can be attributed  mainly to improved  quality silage  
which  was achieved  by cutting  at the right time.
Liveweight  gains per acre have been improving  every year (Table  5). 
This has been due to improved  pastures  and to increasing  stocking  rate 
to utilise the extra pasture  production.

Over the years there has been very little change  in the phosphate  and 
potash applications,  but as stocking  rate has increased,  the nitrogen  
application  has also been increased.
Nitrogen  is applied  both to the grazing  area and the silage areas,  and 
approximately  50 per cent of the total nitrogen  is used for silage. On 
the grazing  area nitrogen  was applied  in February  to all paddocks  and 
to some paddocks  in May, June, July and August.
The most consistent  result from this experiment  has been the better  
performance  of the lambs  on the mixed system.  The performance  of the 
cattle on this system  during  the grazing  season  was not depressed  and 
as compared  with the all cattle system  it was better most years.
The higher lamb growth rates on the mixed stocking  treatment  as 
compared  to the all sheep  treatment  could be due to a number  of reasons  
of which  the most obvious  are:
1. more pasture  available,
2. less parasites,  and
3. combinations  of 1. and 2.
Since the cattle liveweight  gains were not depressed  on the mixed 
grazing  treatment  and since sheep graze more closely  than cattle it is 
quite probably  that there was no shortage  of herbage  on treatment  C. 
On the other hand the all sheep pastures  are always grazed very 
closely  in April and it is quite possible  that intake of feed by the ewe 
may be restircted  which would reduce milk yield, and consequently,  
lamb growth  rate.
Since the cattle were not young  they would be resistant  to intestinal  
parasites  and consequently  they would not be contaminating  the pas­
ture. This could result in a lower parasite  burden  on the mixed stocking  
treatment  as compared  with the all sheep  treatment.
The individual  performance  of the cattle has been improving  each  
year particularly  over the winter  period.  This can be attributed  to getting  
the conservation  programme  properly  organised  and as a result making  
better quality silage. For example  in 1965 the land was closed for 
silage on May 15 and cut June 29; in 1966 it was closed  on May 10 and 
cut June 29; in 1967 it was closed May 5 and the first cut was taken on 
June 17 and the second  cut taken in August.  In 1968 it was closed  April  
12 and cut June 1 and the second  cut taken in July. The work by Dr. 
R. B. McCarrick  at Grange  has clearly  demonstrated  the advantages  of 
early-cut  silage in terms of performance  of beef cattle.
Financial  returns
In the sheep system a gross margin  of £23 per acre was achieved  in 
1968. In the cattle system  the gross margin  was £41 per acre whereas  
in the mixed system  it was £36. At first sight the returns  from the sheep  
system  are low but the following  factors  must be kept in mind :
1. Galway  ewes were used in this project  and the lambing  percentage  
per 100 ewes mated was in the region of 115 percent.  Evidence  
from work at Grange  has shown that if cross-bred  ewes (Grey- 
faces or Halfbreeds)  were used the lambing  percentage  could be 
135 percent  and this would mean an extra £7-£8 per acre. This 
aspect is being studied  at present.
2. Wool  prices have been decreasing  in recent years. The return per 
ewe from wool for 1968 was almost the same as that for 1964 
even though  wool yield had doubled.
3. The ewes on this project were lambed in mid-March  and con­
sequently  they were fed meals before lambing.  If lambing  was 
put back until early April meal feeding  could be reduced by 
allowing  the ewes access to grass before lambing.  We are now 
studying  this approach.
47
4. Finally  it should always  be remembered  that in order to set up a 
system of sheep farming  less capital is required  than for most  
other livestock  systems  and most of the capital  is invested  in live­
stock.
N.P. The returns  from the cattle and mixed systems  are quite good  
particularly  when account  is taken of the fact that the cattle came 
into the system  at £11 per cwt. It should be noted that this work 
is being carried  out on permanent  pastures  at high stocking  rates  
and that average  liveweight  gain from April to March is almost  
5 cwt. per animal.
One of the main problems  encountered  on this farm was the winter ­
ing of the sheep. Since the soils are liable to poach easily it was found 
that wintering  ewes heavily  concentrated  on a paddock  did not work 
as satisfactorily  as at Grange.  The paddock  became  so severely  poached  
that ewes had no dry area on which to lie. For the past two winters  
the ewes have been wintered  on a sawdust  pad and this has worked  
quite well.
The results  of this project  again highlight  the potential  of Irish grass ­
land, provided  reasonable  inputs of fertiliser  are used and reasonable  
standards  of management  are practised.  They also show that the return  
from drystock  farming,  while lower than that from dairying  at the same 
level of intensity,  are still very promising.
In conclusion,  I would like to pay tribute  to Aidan McLoughlin  who 
as Farm Manager  has been responsible  for the success  of this project  
at Rallintubber.

The Feeding  and Management  
of the Suckler  Herd
by
Colin Ball
School  of Agriculture.  Inverness
PART  I—SYSTEMS  OF SUCKLED  CALF  PRODUCTION
Before  considering  systems  of suckled  calf production  it is first of all 
necessary  to examine  briefly  the feed requirements  of the cow and calf.
As far as the feed requirements  of the cow are concerned  the year 
may be divided  into two roughly  equal periods  one consisting  of the 
latter stages of pregnancy  and the first four months  of lactation  during  
which her nutritional  requirements  are relatively  high and another  
period during  which her nutritional  requirements  are for maintenance  
only apart from any need to restore  body reserves  depleted  during  the 
more productive  period.  In the case of the calf its requirement  for feed 
independent  of its dam is relatively  small during  the first two months  
of life but subsequently  this increases  rapidly  so that by the time it is 
4 months  old the major part of its diet must be supplied  directly  to the 
calf (1) and if high levels of performance  are to be obtained  the quality  
of this diet needs to be high.
It should be obvious  that systems  of production  designed  to ensure  
that periods  of maximum  demand  for feeds coincide  as near as possible 
with periods  when these feeds are most freely available  are likely to be 
the most efficient.  Again the year may be divided  into two parts, the 
winter period when the diets available  usually  consist  very largely of 
conserved  feeds and the summer  period during  which the cow has to 
rely entirely  upon grazing.
Winter diets can be divided into two major categories,  those of 
relatively  high quality,  usually  conserved  grass products,  and those of 
relatively  low quality  such as those based upon straw or other arable  
by-products.  Similarly  summer  grazings  fall into three major categories.  
Firstly,  highly  productive  pastures  on lowland  and upland  farms  capable  
of responding  to intensive  systems  of management;  secondly  the less 
productive  pastures  often found in the enclosed  improved  areas of hill 
farms, the major function  of which might be to provide  grazing  for 
hill ewes at critical  times,  and thirdly  the true extensive  hill grazings.
All six possible  combinations  of winter  diet and summer  grazing  are 
found in practice  although  some occur much more frequently  than 
others  and there are production  systems  appropriate  to each. The major
:)1
characteristic  of any production  system  is the calving  date and the choice  
of calving date is the most important  decision  associated  with the 
management  of a suckler herd. Various  investigations  (2, 3) have 
shown that when suckled  calves are sold at the usual autumn  sales the 
major factor affecting  prices is calving  date. However,  improving  sale 
prices by means of advancing  the calving  date does not necessarily 
increase  profits  but it must be recognised  that in years when the autumn  
market  is relatively  weak it is the price of the younger  and smaller  calf 
which  suffers  most.
The combination  of high quality  winter diet and highly productive  
summer  grazing  is most frequently  found on the all-grass  lowland  or 
upland farm. On many of these farms the bulk of the winter feed 
available  will be in the form of good quality  conserved  grass. Where  
accommodation  is not available  to house weaned  calves most of this 
conserved  grass will be consumed  by the cows. At the level of feeding 
which is required  to satisfy the appetite  of the cows this quality of 
diet will provide  for much more than maintenance  requirements.  One 
way of exploiting  this situation  is to calve the cows in September  and 
October  so that at least the latter part of pregnancy  coincides  with a 
period of relatively  cheap feed supplies.  This choice  of calving  date has 
the further  advantage  that calving  may take place outdoors  in relatively  
good weather  conditions  so that many of the health risks associated  
with calving  indoors  under closely  confined  conditions  can be avoided. 
Subsequently  the cows and calves may be housed or outwintered  
according  to circumstances.  On lowland  farms it may be necessary  to 
house stock in order to avoid serious  poaching  of the pastures  but on 
upland  farms there are frequently  areas of poorer  quality  ground  with 
shelter which can be used to accommodate  stock during the winter  
feeding  period.  The cost of housing  for autumn  calving  herds is inevit ­
ably fairly high since space has to be provided  for fairly large calves in 
addition  to the cows towards  the end of the winter.  There is no doubt  
that the more recently  introduced  forms  of housing  utilising  slatted  floors  
or cubicles  are the most suitable  for the purpose  since the cost of provid ­
ing bedding  for conventional  housing  is almost  prohibitive.
During  the early part of the winter  the cows must receive  the best of 
the available  feed supplies  but as soon as the cows are satisfactorily  
mated, say at the end of January,  the emphasis  can be changed  to 
feeding  the calves and the cows may be fed the poorer  quality  material  
available.  Since the feed conversion  of the rapidly  growing  calf is high,  
supplementary  feeding  with cereals  can often be justified.
By the time the grazing  season  commences  the feed requirements  of 
the cows are relatively  low but the requirements  of the calves are high.  
If the summer  pastures  are to be utilised  efficiently  then some provision
52
has to be made to prevent  competition  between  cows and calves,  either  
by weaning  at the end of the winter or by practising  some form of 
creep grazing  system.  In either case the calves  can be allowed  access  to 
the best of the available  grass and the cows function  as scavengers.  This 
system  has a considerable  advantage  in that the output  per cow can be 
very high (which may justify the relatively  high cost of housing)  and 
furthermore  it has considerable  flexibility  in that the calves  are sufficiently  
large to be marketed  at any time after mid-summer.
An alternative  system which is probably  more applicable  when  
weaned calves can be retained  on the farm to consume  the better  
quality  winter  feed, involves  the choice of a spring calving  date com­
mencing  say February.  In this system  the mating  period coincides  with 
the early part of the grazing  season so that it is relatively  easy to 
maintain  a regular  calving  pattern.  Furthermore,  the milk yields of the 
cows respond  to liberal supplies  of spring  grass and the progress  of the 
calves  can be quite spectacular  with liveweight  gains approaching  3 lb./ 
day. Experience  at the East of Scotland  College of Agriculture  (4) 
indicates  that there is little difference  in the profitability  of the two 
systems  except  that the spring  calving  system  is much more vulnerable  
to year to year fluctuations  in the market  when the calves cannot be 
overwintered.  On the other hand it must be said that a considerable  
degree of skill and enthusiasm  may be required  to achieve  high levels  
of output  with the autumn  calving  system.  Basically  this is the system 
in combination  with winter  fattening  which is practised  at Flenly Manor,  
the l.C.l. experimental  farm (5).
In some areas, particularly  in upland  valleys,  there exist on the same 
farm areas of highly productive  grass in association  with areas of 
poorer quality rough grazing or improved  hill grazing. The major  
function  of the more productive  areas is to provide  the bulk of the 
winter feed supplies  and frequently  it is the availability  of these  
supplies  which limits the stock carrying  capacity  on these farms. In 
addition,  the more productive  areas may have to be utilised  for grazing  
purposes  until the poorer  quality  grazing  becomes  available.  These less 
productive  areas often carry considerable  sheep stocks throughout  the 
season,  or in the case of surface  reseeded  areas on hill grazings,  are 
utilised  for the hill flock during the lambing  and tupping  periods.  In 
these situations  the suckler  herd, in addition  to providing  income  from  
the sale of calves,  fulfils an essential  function  in maintaining  the poorer  
quality  grazing,  consuming,  during  the periods  of more active growth,  
material  which is surplus  to the requirements  of the sheep.
In these circumstances  a system based upon autumn  calving  is not 
feasible  because  there is not sufficient  good quality summer  grazing 
available  for the calves.  Also, because  of the considerable  pressure  on
53
feed supplies  during the early part of the grazing  season,  there is a 
considerable  risk that calves will not be sufficiently  well grown by the 
autumn  sales when as many as possible  must be sold off the farm.  
Furthermore,  any clash between  the calving  period and lambing  must  
be avoided,  otherwise  excessive  demands  upon labour can occur. 
Under  these conditions,  there is little alternative  to advancing  the calving 
date into January  and February  and accepting  the fact that the cows  
will have to be fed very liberally  at the end of the winter  to ensure  that 
cows are satisfactorily  mated and their milk yields held at a level which  
will ensure  a degree  of protection  for the calves when feed supplies  are 
limited  at the beginning  of the grazing  season.  Inevitably  these higher 
feed costs will affect the profitability  of the suckler herd but most 
farmers  would offset this against  the benefits  derived  from the function  
of the suckler  herd in maintaining  the grazings  for sheep.
The combination  of high quality  winter  diets and very poor open hill 
grazings  occurs most frequently  where farms are situated in steep 
valleys in mountainous  areas and also when separate  farms in both 
extreme  hill and lowland  areas exist in the same ownership.  Tradi ­
tionally  the extreme  hill grazings  have carried stocks of small hardy  
cows calving  in late spring but as farmers  on lowland  fattening  farms  
have placed more and more emphasis  on the size and growth  {xttential  
of the calves they buy it has become  increasingly  difficult  to find a 
market  for the small hill calf. At the same time it is still thought  that 
there are considerable  benefits  to be derived  from the presence  of cattle  
on hill grazings.  One method  which is now being adopted  is to employ  
a variant  of the autumn  calving  system suggested  for lowland  farms,  
weaning  the calves  in the spring  and grazing  them at high stocking  rates  
on the better quality  grass while the dry cows spend the summer  graz­
ing period on the open hill. In this way it is possible  to utilise a larger  
and more productive  cow which,  when freed of the necessity  to produce  
milk, cah still perform  a useful  function  on the hill and at the same time 
produce  a calf more suited to current  market  requirements.  Clearly  this 
is a system which can be very attractive  to the farmer  who has both 
hill and lowland  units but where the area of good quality  grassland  is 
limited  the effect of using some of this for the grazing  of weaned  calves  
must be to reduce the winter feed supplies  and the number  of cows  
kept unless purchased  feed can be used to replace  that lost by grazing 
some of the acres previously  used for conservation.
Winter  diets of low quality  are often based upon arable by-products  
such as straw and are encountered  most frequently  in combination  
with highly productive  rotational  grassland  on arable farms where a 
major part of the income is derived  from cash crops. During  recent
54
years, despite a growing  tendency  towards  continuous  cash cropping,  
many farmers  have expressed  a wish to re-introduce  grass into their  
rotations  as a break crop so as to avoid some of the problems  
associated  with continuous  grain growing.  The major problem  has been 
to devise some means of extracting  sufficient  income  from these acres  
in order to provide  a satisfactory  alternative  to cash cropping.  In this 
connection  some recent work at the North of Scotland  College of 
Agriculture  is relevant  and will be described  in some detail in part If 
since it illustrates  not only a system of production  suitable  for this 
particular  set of circumstances  but also many of the problems  which  
have to be faced in devising  any production  system.
Furthermore,  it is on this type of farm that the major  opportunity  for 
the expansion  of the production  of beef animals  exists. Most of the 
suitable  animals  produced  by the dairy industry  are now being utilised 
and any further  increase  in the supplies  from hill and upland areas is 
likely to be slow and costly.
On many hill farms the area of enclosed  rough and improved  hill 
grazing  is often capable  of carrying  a much greater  number  of cows  
during  the grazing  season  than can be supported  by the limited  number  
of acres available  for the production  of conserved  feed. To overcome  
this problem  additional  feed is purchased  and frequently  much of this 
is in the form of straw or hay of doubtful  quality  and much of the 
home produced  feed may consist of arable silage or green oat hay 
because  of the necessity  to produce  the maximum  bulk of feed from a 
limited area. These feeds provide  a basis for a winter diet similar in 
quality  to that used in the North of Scotland  College  of Agriculture  
experiments.  Flowever,  because  of the necessity  for an early calving  
commencing  in January  on these farms the level of supplementation  has 
to be raised considerably  in the latter part of the winter or at least 
good quality  hay substituted  for the poorer  quality  roughage.
The worst combination  of poor quality  winter  feed supplies  and open  
hill grazings  occurs quite frequently  in the more remote  mountainous  
areas in the north and west of the British  Isles. In these areas it is not 
possible  to augment  winter feed supplies  with bulky purchased  feeds 
because  of heavy transport  costs and purchases  have to be restricted  
to minimum  quantities  of concentrated  supplements.  Inevitably  calving  
has to be delayed  until late spring under these conditions  and because 
of the poor quality  of the summer  grazing  only the smaller  type of hardy  
hill cow can maintain  herself  and suckle  a calf adequately.  Consequently  
many of the calves produced  under these conditions  are small and 
difficult  to market.  It is doubtful  whether  there is much future for this 
form of production.  A modification  of the grazing  conditions  by means  
of surface  treatment  would make it possible  to maintain  a larger cow 
or at least enable  the cow to suckle  a calf sired by a bull of one of the
55
larger  breeds.  In the past it was the practice  to mate many  of the cows of 
the hardy hill breeds  to bulls of a larger dual purpose  type such as the 
Cumberland  Shorthorn  so that although  calves might have been small  
when weaned  they had a considerable  potential  for growth and the 
females  met a ready demand  as replacements  for suckler  herds else­
where. In recent years since the virtual  disappearance  of the large dual 
purpose  type of Shorthorn,  sires of the early maturing  beef breeds  have 
been used instead and although  many of the calves are of attractive  
conformation,  their small size and lack of growth  potential  makes  them 
difficult  to sell to buyers  from lowland  fattening  farms  and the unpredic ­
table maternal  qualities  of the females  considerably  reduces  their value 
as potential  herd replacements.  To suggest  that the Friesian  which has 
largely  replaced  the dual purpose  Shorthorn  in its dairy role might also 
replace  it as a crossing  sire will no doubt be regarded  as heresy by 
many but it certainly  has the potential  to remedy  the major defects 
which  currently  exist in these calves. If these changes  were accompanied  
by some arrangement  to grow the calves on better farms until they 
reached  a more marketable  size then the future of suckled  calf pro­
duction  in these difficult  areas would be more certain.  Fortunately  this 
latter arrangement  has already a small beginning  on a co-operative  
basis in the North  of Scotland.
There  is clearly  a very wide range of circumstances  in which suckled 
calf production  is practised  and a considerable  number  of ways in 
which these systems  can be varied.
PART  II—SUCKLER  COWS  ON ARABLE  FARMS
The major objection  to beef cows on lowland  arable farms is that 
under conventional  systems  of feeding  and management  the acreage  
requirement/cow  is high and therefore  profit/acre  is low.
It was, therefore,  decided  to explore  the possibility  of reducing  this 
acreage requirement.  One way of doing this is to devise a winter 
feeding  system  based upon barley  straw which makes  no demand  upon 
farm acres and restricts  the acreage  requirement  to that necessary  for 
summer  grazing.
At the level of nutrition  required  to provide  for maintenance  or low 
levels of milk production  straw is potentially  a valuable  feed. However, 
a diet of straw alone is likely to be inadequate  in terms of energy, 
protein,  minerals  and vitamins.  The two latter  components  can be readily 
supplied  as a mineral/vitamin  mix. The conventional  way of supplying 
the protein  supplement  would be to use a vegetable  protein  source  such 
as Ground  Nut Cake. A second  source,  currently  attracting  a consider ­
able amount  of attention,  is urea which supplies  nitrogen  in a non­
protein form. Draff (Wet Distillers ’ Grains) is a further possibility 
either fed alone or in conjunction  with barley.
56
The Estiihlishment  Year November,  1965—31st October,  1966.
Since relatively  low levels of nutrition  were to be expected  from the 
diets employed  it was decided  to delay the commencement  of calving 
until February  to avoid the need for heavy supplementary  feeding  to 
maintain  milk production  during a long winter feeding  period. Here ­
ford X Friesian  females  were chosen  for their obvious  maternal  qualities  
which it was hoped would compensate  for the delayed  calving.  40 of 
these were assembled  during November  and December  1965, mostly 
heifers  in calf.
During  the winter 1965/66  it was decided  to feed four groups  of 10 
animals each on 4 diets consisting  of barley straw ad lih. with 
supplements.
A. 25 lb. draff to supply  
Starch Equivalent.1.2 lb. Digestible  Crude Protein,  3.5 lb
B.\2\ lb. draff 2‘ lb. barley to supply  0.8 lb. Digestible  Crude  
Protein,  3.5 lb. Starch  Equivalent.
C. 5 lb. barley + 70 gm. urea to supply 0.8 lb. Digestible  Crude  
Protein,  3.5 lb. Starch  Equivalent.
D. 5 lb. of a mixture  of 3 barley: 1 Ground  nut cake to supply  0.8 lb. 
Digestible  Crude Protein,  3.5 lb. Starch  Equivalent.
All cows received  daily lb. of the following  mineral/vitamin  mix:  
36 lb. Steamed  Bone Flour; 11 lb. Calcined  Magnesite;  1 lb. Manganese  
Sulphate;  8 lb. .Salt; 1 oz. (30 gms.) Copper  Sulphate;  l/5th oz. 
(6 gms) Cobalt Sulphate;  200,000  l.U. per lb. Vitamin  A; 20,000  
EU. per lb. Vitamin  D.
Supplement  A contains  what is considered  to be sufficient  D.C.P. to 
meet all the requirements  of the pregnant  cow.
Supplements  B, C and D contain  only f of this optimum  level and 
expect  the aminal  to meet additional  requirments  either  from the barley  
straw or from body reserves.  This is a level which is commonly  found  
in farm practice  with other diets and also approximates  to that employed  
by other workers  studying  the use of non-protein  nitrogen  supplements.  
All four supplements  have been designed  to supply the same amount  
of Starch  Equivalent  (S.E.) (within  the limits of our existing  knowledge). 
On the evidence  of the relatively  small weight  losses incurred  by these  
heifers and the performance  of their calves, it was decided  that addi­
tional supplementary  feeding  was not required  and the original  levels  
of supplementary  feeding  were maintained  throughout  the whole [period  
until the animals  were turned  out to graze on 2hd May. The differences 
between  the average  bodyweight  changes  after calving  were small and 
appeared  to be associated  with the differences  in average  straw con­
sumption.  Average  daily consumption  of barley  straw was for:
57
Group  A: 12 lb.
Group  B: 14 lb.
Group  C: 17 lb.
Group  D: 17 lb.
During  the summer  period the 40 heifers,  their calves,  4 bulling  heifers 
and a bull were maintained  on 27 acres of permanent  grass divided  
into 8 paddocks.  In order to do this the heifers  were allowed  to consume 
grass to appetite  during  the early part of the season  and as the season  
progressed,  the calves were allowed to creep graze so as to avoid 
competition  between  the heifers  and calves  as grass production  declined. 
During  the early part of the season the heifers gained a considerable  
amount  of weight and even during  August  and September  maintained  
their bodyweight.
Two cases of muscular  dystrophy  occurred  during  the first week of 
the grazing  season.  There was no evidence  that these were due to any 
particular  supplement  fed to the heifers during the winter. However,  
there is a considerable  amount  of evidence  to show that this condition  
is frequently  associated  with other diets based upon low quality  
roughage  and it was decided  that in the future calves would receive  
supplementary  vitamin  E and/or  selenium  during  the latter part of the 
winter.
The fertility  of the heifers  was satisfactory.  A Hereford  bull ran with 
the herd during  May and June and all heifers  except  four which calved 
late were successfully  mated during  this period.
First Full Year 1st November,  1966-31st  October,  1967.
There was no apparent  difference  in performance  between  the groups  
of heifers  receiving  the four different  supplements  during  the 1965/66  
winter.  However,  it was clear that animals  consumed  less straw when  
receiving  draff. In some areas, draff is more readily available  and 
cheaper  than straw. It therefore  seemed desirable  to determine  the 
effect of feeding  draff to appetite  on both straw consumption  and 
animal performance  and so group D were fed draff to appetite  during  
the 1966/67  winter.
During this period, the cows were fed the following  supplements  
and consumed  the amounts  of straw indicated.
Group  A. 25 lb. Draff + 14| lb. Straw.
Group B. 12^ lb. Draff + 2^- lb. Barley + 17 lb. Straw.
Group  C. 5 lb. Barley + 70 gm. urea + 23 lb. Straw.
Group  D. Draff to appetite  (40 lb.) + 11| lb. Straw.
(Minerals  and Vitamins  to all groups).
58
The herd was housed from 1st November,  1966 to 25th April, 1967.  
Calving  commenced  6th February,  1967. The mean calving  date was 
6th March.  During  the 1967 summer  the total herd comprised  48 cows  
and 50 calves which were maintained  on 33 acres of grass. Nitrogen  
usage was 160 units N/acre.  Supplementary  feed was introduced  to 
the calves on 12th September,  1967 and the calves were weaned 
gradually  at the end of September.
At the beginning  of the 1966/67  winter the mineral and vitamin  
supplement  was amended  to include  trace levels of copper  and cobalt  
and all calves were dosed with selenium  as a means of preventing  
muscular  dystrophy.
A Lincoln  Red bull was run with the herd from turnout  to mid-July.  
Second  Full Year 1st November,  1967-31st  October,  1968.
During  the winter  of 1967/ ’68 Groups  A, B and C were maintained  on 
the same basic treatments  as before but Group D was transferred  to 
the barley/urea  treatment  in order to obtain more information  about  
this treatment.  In addition,  the quantities  of the supplemens  were raised  
by 20 per cent, partly to cater for the increase  in the size of the cows 
during the previous  year. The daily supplement  of the four groups  
together  with the approximate  quantities  of straw consumed  were as 
follows :
Group A 30 lb. Draff + 16^ lb. Straw.
Group B. 15 lb. Draff + 3 lb. Barley + 18i lb. Straw.
Groups  C. & D. 6 lb. Barley + 70 gm. urea + 26 lb. Streaw.
The herd was housed from 8th November,  1967 to 24th April, 1968.  
Calving  commenced  12th February,  1968. The mean calving  date was 
13th March.
Again during  the 1968 summer  the cows and calves were stocked  at 
3 cows/2  acres and paddock  grazed. Nitrogen  usage was 160 units  
N/acre.  The calves  were weaned  at the end of September  and the cows  
are again in calf to the Lincoln  Red bull.
Physical  Results  from Years 1966/67  and 1967/68
Table 1 shows the average  weight losses by the four groups of cows  
during the two winters.  During  the 1966/67  winter Group D clearly  
differed  from the other three groups  in that its weight  loss was negligible.  
However,  these figures  do not tell the whole story since Group  C was 
obviously  in poorer  condition  than the other groups  as many who saw 
the cows at the demonstration  will remember.

During  the 1967/68  winter there was again little difference  in the 
losses of Groups  A and B. The loss of Group  C was a little higher  and 
Group D which had retained  its weight advantage  during the 1967 
summer  lost it dtiring  the following  winter.
Table 2 shows the birthweights  of the calves in the two years and for 
Groups  A and B indicates  little difference  between  either the treatments  
or the levels  applied  in the two years. The results  for Group  C, however.

seem to indicate  that at the level applied 1966/67  the Barley/urea  
supplement  seemed to depress birthweights  in a year when straw 
quality  was poor. The superior  birthweights  of Group D are probably  
a characteristic  of this Group  since they have been achieved  on both 
extremes  of diet.
The gain of calves  from birth to turnout  gives a further  indication  of 
the effect of the winter  diets. The data in Table 3 tend to follow the 
same pattern  as the birthweight  data and furthermore  indicate  that the 
levels of supplementation  were more satisfactory  in 1967/68.

Clearly  the final assessment  of the winter treatment  must be based  
upon the performance  to weaning  of the calves. Table 4 shows the 
weaning  weights  for the two years.

These data would seem to indicate  that there is little to choose  
between  the winter diets employed  in these studies particularly  at the 
level employed  in 1967/68.  At the levels employed  in 1966/67  when 
straw quality was poor the Barley/urea  supplement  may have been 
slightly inferior.  However,  one could not recommend  this level of 
supplementation  in practice  since there would seem to be a risk of 
impairing  the fertility  of the cows. It is doubtful  whether  the improved  
performance  of the calves to weaning  in 1968 can be attributed  to the 
improved  level of supplementation  in 1967/68.  (See performance  of 
Group  D). It is more likely that it is partly due to the increased  age of 
the cows and partly  due to the change  of sire. The diagram  showing  the 
progress  of the calves  from birth to weaning  in the two years shows  that 
the superiority  of the 1968 calves increases  with age indicating  that the 
Lincoln  Red sire may be largely  responsible  for the improvement.
Overall  it can be stated that the technical  problems  encountered  in 
developing  this system  have been fewer than might have been expected.  
There still remains  some work to be done to improve  the Barley/urea  
supplement  but even at this stage of development  it is quite acceptable.  
Furthermore  it has been appreciated  from the outset that a modifica ­
tion of the system  to carry the calves through  to slaughter  could make
61
the summer  management  much easier in addition  to stabilizing  returns  
through  selling on a guaranteed  market.
Financial  Returns
Clearly  when an attempt  is made to develop  a system of production  
such as this it is necessary  to apply some sort of financial  appraisal  to 
the physical  data. Two questions  need to be answered.
1. Is the system  capable  of yielding  a satisfactory  return per acre?
2. Is the system  likely to provide  a satisfactory  return on the capital  
involved?
In these circumstances  it is possible  to apply a form of gross margin  
analysis.  The average  gross margin  for the two full years described  is 
£48 per acre and the estimated  return on tenants  capital  is 15 per cent.
62
It must be emphasised  that this form of financial  appraisal  must be 
treated with extreme  caution.  It can only give an indication  of the 
potential  of the system.  However,  these returns  indicate  that the system 
merits serious  consideration,  particularly  by grain growing  farmers  who 
would like to increase  their grass acreage.

Multiple  Suckling  of Calves
by
F. J. Harte
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
Introduction
I wish to describe  a multiple  suckling  system  of calf rearing  which we 
have developed  at Grange.  This system was derived  from our earlier  
work on calf rearing  and particular  attention  was given to the possi- 
blity of using first quality  grassland.  It seems obvious  also that a cow 
of high biological  efficiency  should  be used. The system  involved  suckl ­
ing six calves per cow and even at this stage 1 would ask you to bear 
in mind that in any calf suckling  system the cow is the big eater in 
the acre or whatever  unit of land is chosen.
M. Drennan  gives you details  of his single suckling  work at Grange  
in his paper on page 29.
It is important  also to stress at this stage that ;
1. Barley  prices (and therefore  concentrate  prices) have risen very 
considerably— by about one third over the last eight years.
2. Milk replacer  prices have increased  by over 20 per cent since the 
ruling by the Minister  for Agriculture  that butter fat is the only 
sourc of fat to be used in milk replacers.
3. Whole  milk prices are now either remaining  static or decreasing.  
Taking  into account  that the cost of living continues  to rise then 
it is reasonable  to say that milk, particularly  if it is produced  in 
any sizeable  quantity,  is going down in price.
4. Finally, there is the Government  subsidy towards  encouraging  
beef production.  You will appreciate  therefore  that while a suckl ­
ing system  may not have been economical  a few years ago many  
factors  have now changed,  which look like making  this system  of 
beef production  most interesting.
Background
Before setting  out the system I will refer briefly to some background  
work we have done on effects  of intervals  of feeding  on calf performance.  
I will also give figures on performance  of calves suckled  at different  
numbers  per cow. Many  of you will recall that I presented  this work in 
detail to you some years ago (1).
We showed  at Grange,  like others,  that calves  could be reared  success ­
fully by feeding  once daily, either through  buckets  or through  a calfe- 
teria. You can see from Table 1 that there was no major  difference  in 
calf liveweights  at H, 3 or 6 months  of age.
65

Once daily 5-84 days ... ... 93 120 195 304
Once  daily 12-84  days 94 1.30 205 330
I should perhaps  emphasize  that the level of milk feeding  in the 
experiment  described  in Table 1 was low and I feel this is important.  
All calves received  1 gallon of milk replacer  (one gallon = 1 lb. dry 
powder + 9 lb. water) per head per day and meals were available  
ad lib.
In fact, we found that when we ommitted  Sunday  feeding  to some of 
the treatment  groups  the performance  of these calves was no different  
to that of calves fed every day of the week (1).
Table 2 shows the performance  of multiple  suckled  calves at pasture  
at different  numbers  per cow and over four grazing  seasons.  All these  
calves were born in mid-March  and went outdoors  almost  immediately.

6 calves/cow  (1968) 111 283 356 403 89
In 1965 and 1966 the cows were grazed separately  from the calves  
but in 1967 and 1968 the cows and calves were rotationally  grazed.  
The cows were following  the calves in rotation.  The stocking  rate in 
1968 was higher  than in 1967. Table 2 shows that the performance  per 
calf in 1967 and 1968 was superior  to that of those reared in earlier  
years. This is particularly  noticable  when 1965 and 1967 or 1968 is 
compared,  since the intake of milk per calf in 1965 (131 gallons)  was 
greater  than in 1967 and particularly  so than in 1968. It appears  from 
these experiments  that grass quality  is very important  because  in the 
years (1965 and 1966) in which we had good control over grassland  
management  and had good grass available  throughout  the grazing  
season,  we had the heaviest  calves  at 32 weeks  of age. We had consider­
66
able difficulty  in maintaining  good grass quality  for calves in 1965 and 
1966 but this problem  did not arise in 1967 because  of the presence  
of the cows in the system.  In 1968 and 1969 there was also no problem  
in maintaining  good grass quality.
The system
Armed  with the above data and of course  other facets of calf produc ­
tion that is encountered  over the years in research  and production  we 
set out the following  multiple  suckling  system.  In it we have 8 cows  
suckling  48 calves (i.e. 6 calves per cow). The calves (mainly  Hereford  
X Shorthorns  and some Hereford  x Friesians)  were born in mid-March  
and suckled  the cows throughout  the grazing  season in a controlled  
system  of management.  Suckling  and grazing  finished  in the first week 
of November.  We give each cow and six calves 2| acres (a total of 
20 acres in the system)  to provide  grazing  and silage for the 8 cows and 
48 calves,  i.e. 56 animals  (Diagram  1).
There is a small pen in each grazing  paddock  for suckling  (Diagram  
2). The cows are put into this each morning  about 8.30 and 32 of the 
48 calves  are allowed  to suckle  the cows. In the afternoon  the cows are 
put into the pen again (about 4.30) and the remaining  16 calves are 
suckled.  Each group of calves is therefore  suckling  once daily. The 
"morning ” and the “evening”  calves  are kept separately  to facilitate  the 
suckling  management.
In an experiment  now going on at Grange  we are using a suckling  
race instead of the pen and it is certainly  a much more convenient  
method  of suckling.  It allows the cows to move about a lot less and 
also allows  greater  ease of introducing  calves  on to cows in the first two 
weeks or so. In wet weather  it also has some attractions  over the pen 
idea, in that cows do not have access to the same area as the calves 
and so the ground  does not cut up so easily. Obviously  care must be 
taken to have the lower bar of the race the correct  height.  We are at 
present  looking  into the possibility  of designing  a suitable  mobile  suckl ­
ing race. All calves  go before  the cows in a rotational  paddock  system.  
We have not fully worked  out yet the right number  of paddocks  to use 
but you will understand  that 2 paddocks  are always occupied.  Some 
interesting  work being done at present  by Dan Browne  may help to 
elucidate  this problem.
Grazing  and silage
The 8 cows and 48 calves only require  9 of the 20 acres for grazing  
to the second  week of May. Diagram  3 shows  the proportions  of the 20 
acres used for grazing  and silage  at various  stages  throughout  the grazing  
season.  A further  3 acres is added at that stage and it is only from the 
end of August  that the whole 20 acres is grazed.
We, therefore,  cut silage 3 times off 8 acres and once off 3 acres. 
This gives us a total yield of silage of approximately  200 tons. This
67
provides  us with more than sufficient  silage for the 8 cows (5 tons each) 
and 48 calves (3j tons each).
It is obvious  we are getting  over one of the big problems  in outdoor  
calf rearing  which is grass control  and it is almost  impossible  to main ­
tain good grass growth.  This has also been shown  at Hurley  (2) and at 
Moorepark  (3).
It will also be appreciated  that calves grow in the opposite  direction  
to grass. When the calves  have grown big, by say July, grass growth  is 
easing  off. My colleague  working  on the physiology  of grass growth  at 
Grange  says that about 60 per cent of the seasons ’ grass is grown by 
mid-July  in normal  years (4).
68
GRAZING  & SUCKLING  MANAGEMENT
Parasite  control
We are now finishing  our second  year on the same 20 acres of land and 
we have encountered  to date no major  disease  problems.  The calves  are 
dosed mid-June  and again about six weeks later. Husk has not been a 
problem,  though  some was present.  This is being checked  out by our 
parasitologist.  Dr. Downey.
The cows were kept in outdoor  cubicles  last winter  and this winter  
we hope to keep the calves also in ‘topless ’ cubicles.  This follows  my 
colleague  Dr. McCarrick ’s work at Grange  on wintering  where  he found  
no difference  in cattle  performance  whether  they were outdoor  or indoors,  
when given similar  amounts  of feed (5).

milk intake of the calves for various  periods  throughout  the grazing  
season.

The mean daily milk intakes  of the calves never reached  a gallon a 
day. Milk intakes  are recorded  by weighing  the calf before and after  
suckling  the cow. It was not convenient  to do this before 14 days of 
age. We know,  however,  that the yield f)er cow was lower in the pieriod  
before 29 days than thereafter.  While low intake is undoubtedly  
lowering  performance  in early life it may have the advantage  that you
have less scouring  troubles.  , . •
We looked  at the performance  of individual  calves and related  gams 
to milk intakes.  We found that those calves that had the highest  intakes  
(were consistent  in having  them) were the biggest  calves on the ex{^ri-  
ment and also had the highest  gains. This was true from the various  
periods throughout  the experiment.  However,  taking any group of 
calves within  a particular  weight  range it did not follow  the calves  with 
the highest  milk intake  also had the highest  gains (Table  4).

♦Average  daily gain (lb).
The mean weight  of the heavy and light calves at 2 weeks was 110 
and 90 lb., respectively  and the average  daily gain of the remaining  
calves in the group  was 1.8 lb./day  from 2-18 weeks  of age. In general  
the calves  were fairly heavy but this type of calf is readily  available  on 
the market  in Spring.
71
Milk yields
The average  milk yields of the cows was 768 gallons  for 1968 and the 
mean milk intakes  of each calf was 128 gallons.  The mean liveweight  
of the cows at the start of lactation  was 518 kg. and it was 539 kg. at 
November.  Work  at our dairy research  centre  at Moorepark  and in New 
Zealand  shows that you may expect  an increase  in milk yield due to 
suckling  out rather than milking  out twice daily. Dr. John Walsh is 
in charge  of the work at Moorepark  and he has some interesting  work 
done and in progress  on how a multiple  suckling  system will fit into 
the rearing  of dairy herd replacements  where there is a spread on 
calving.
These multiple  suckled  calves can be got to 6 cwt. at one year old 
having  been wintered  on good silage (and the grassland  management  in 
this system  almost  ensured  good quality  silage) plus 3-6 lb. barley/head  
per day (representing  a daily L.W.G. of 1.75 lb. during the winter  
period).  The liveweight  targets  for various  ages are set out in Table 5. 
Incldently,  it is likely that these targets  could be much higher  if we had 
used a calf of greater  growth  potential.
Table  5

Wt. at 8 months .......................... .............. 205 450 1.70
Wt. at twelve  months .............. 306 672 1.75
It will of course, be appreciated  that it is much easier to get an 
Autumn  born calf to 6 cwt. at 1 year than it is to get a Spring  born 
calf to 6 cwt. when it is 1 year old due to its ability  to use grass in its 
first grazing  season.  It is obvious  therefore  that the earlier  your calf is 
born in the Spring  the greater  will be his weight  at one year old.
Production  per acre
We can now estimate  total production  per unit of 1 cow and six calves  
on acres and then work out production  per acre. From 2| acres you 
can expect a liveweight  gain of 30-31 cwt. (or a total liveweight  of 
animals,  other than cows at the end of one year, of 36 cwt.). This 
means  a liveweight  gain of at least 12 cwt. per acre, and the acre is also 
producing  2/5 of a calf and feeding  2/5 of a cow. To achieve  this
72
production  per acre you will also need approximately  10 cwts. of barley  
(equivalent  to approximately  a further  half acre at most) plus fertiliser.  
Leaving  these male calves entire will further  enhance  production.  This 
has been proved by extensive  work at Grange  on bull beef production  
(6, 7, 8). Changing  the breed of animals  and particularly  earlier  calving  
would also increase  production  per acre.
Fertiliser  requirements
The mean fertiliser  input per acre (over the 20 acres)  at Grange  is given  
in Table 6. I will not dwell on the amount  of fertiliser  we used as this 
will obviously  vary with soil type and climate.
Table  6
Mean  fertiliser  inputs  per acre (on the 20 acres)
Fertiliser
Nitrogen
Phosphate
Potash% active
Units Cwt. ingredient
100 4.3 23
48 3.0 16
200 4.0 50
Indeed it may well be that this amount  of fertiliser  is too high. We 
have a considerable  amount  of work in progress  at Grange  and at other  
centres of the Institute  at present to determine  the “maintenance”  
requirements  of different  grassland  under intensive  farming  systems.
Economic  returns
It is now possible  to draw up a rough balance  sheet for the year and 
this is given in Table 7. Incidently  it will be appreciated  that if we 
ignore  the barley  input as a purchase  then each unit of one cow and six 
calves will require  approximately  3 instead  of 7}^ acres.

This is a very approximate  balance  sheet and the gross margin  can 
obviously  be swayed either way depending  on pricing  of inputs and 
outputs.  I think the costings  1 have given are reasonably  conservative.  
Each individual  can apply his own pricing  depending  on his farming  
system.  It will be appreciated  that a purchase  charge  of 6 calves  at £27 
each is high as it almost  assumes  a mortality  of 1 in 6. In fact we have 
had no mortality  using 48 calves in each of the two years. Allowing  for 
a purchase  of 5 calves (the cow ’s calf will make up the sixth but it has 
an equal chance  of being a heifer) the expenditure  per acre in calves 
would be reduced  from £65 to £55. This would have a result of in­
creasing  the gross margin  by £10 per acre. Using Friesian  calves (be­
cause they are usually  cheaper  at purchase  rather than beef crosses) 
will also likely increase  the gross margin  further.
Tables  8 and 9 clearly  show the effect of calf prices and beef prices 
on margins  per acre. It is obvious  that if calf prices are not too high 
gross margins  will be very good. If calf prices are very high (over £30) 
the systems  which will produce  the calves on the farm, i.e. single  
suckling  and heifer beef both become  attractive.

Assuming  a price of £ll/cwt.  for cattle  6 cwt. @ 12/13 months.
Labour  is also not included.  Allowing  that a man could manage  
60 acres in this system (with help at peak periods)  then the cost of 
permanent  labour  per acre would  be about  £17 per acre (£1000/60)
The Government  subsidy  for beef is not included  but of course  in a 
multiple  suckling  system  this will only have a small impact,  particularly,  
when the subsidy  is per cow and not per calf. In fact the impact  per 
acre is smaller  when the number  of calves per cow is high, yet it is well 
to remember  that the cow is the “hig eater” in the acre and as soon 
as you reduce  calf numbers  per cow you reduce  performance  per acre.  
The investment  per acre is about £100 (allowing  the cow is worth  
£80) and therefore  is higher in stock and lower in equipment  than in 
dairying).
75
Conway  (9) gave the members  of this Association,  last December,  
details of a beef production  system at Ballintubber  and you will see 
the targets  he set for these type of cattle at two years old.
Multiple  suckling  v. Dairying
It is now perhaps  interesting  to contrast  this system  of multiple  suckling 
with milk production  at the present time using 60 acres in both 
instances.  An intensive  cow unit will be stocked  at approximately  one 
cow to the acre.
During  the summer  period there is only 24 cows to be milked  in the 
suckling  unit as against  60 in the dairy unit. At least 16 cows can be 
milked simultaneously  which is a very “large milking  plant”. There is 
also no walking  of cows to and from milking  units, washing  milk 
plant, milk transport,  etc. Sixty cows will have to be wintered  in the 
dairy unit as against  24 cows and 144 calves  in the suckling  unit.
The labour requirements  in the suckling  unit will be lower in the 
summer  than in the milking  unit. The reverse  is true in the winter.  This 
might not be to the disadvantage  of the suckling  unit since most  
systems  of livestock  production  need extra labour  in the summer  for 
silage making.
The economic  returns  from the two systems  are not greatly  different. 
If calf prices are low this will be to the advantage  of the multiple  
suckling  system and the disadvantage  of the dairying  system. The 
reverse  is also true. If all the subsidies  were ignored  then it is likely  
that the miltiple  suckling  system  is a more economically  efficient  system  
per acre than the milking  system.
A few general  points are worth mentioning:
1. From the work at Grange  it appears  that many of the calves for 
this system  could come from beef type heifers.
2. We feel all calves should be foster calves, though some of the 
work being  done by Dr. John Walsh  suggests  that this may not be 
important.
3. It is necessary  to have a bull as it is usually  not possible  to see 
the cows in heat and therefore  you do not know when to call A.I.
4. Like all intensive  grassland  units good fencing  is essential.
5. Compared  with some other systems  of calf rearing,  for example  
group rearing  on milk replacer  to 8 weeks outdoor,  followed  by 
grass and meals,  the multiple  suckling  system  will require:
(a) More labour —though  considerably  less than if you milk the 
cows as in dairying.
76
(b) More acres— 20 acres will keep 8 cows and 48 calves for one 
year while an intensive  calf unit of 20 acres will keep approxi ­
mately 100 calves to one year old.
(c) More capital, but less capital/acre  than an intensive  calf
system.
(d) Less mortality  and veterinary  expenses.
(e) Allows  a greater  flexibility  in selling.
(f) Less wintering  facilities  but somewhat  more silage capacity  
needed .
There are many interesting  research  problems  presented  in this work.  
Parasite  control  and grass utilisation  need further  elucidation.  It will 
of course  also be particularly  interesting  to see what will be the effects 
of (i) earlier  calving  (ii) faster growing  animals  (breeds)  and (iii) using 
bulls instead  of steers.
Summary
It will be appreciated  that the basic principles  of our suckling  system 
are described  here (Indeed  the basic principles  of good calf rearing  are 
also included).  Of course, there are many variations  that could be 
adopted.  Some farmers  may (i) not wish to rear calves outdoors  (ii) 
not wish to suckle  six calves per cow and (iii) wish to suckle  calves  for 
much shorter  periods  than that described  here and thereby  rear con­
siderably  greater  numbers  of calves per cow or return the cows to the 
milking  herd.
In particular  many farmers  could consider  combining  some of the 
earlier  work on early weaning  (10, 11) with suckling,  that is, in effect 
giving small amounts  of whole milk per calf yet instilling  into early  
weaning  the “health  factor ” of suckling.  We have done a little of this 
at Grange  where we reared 8 calves per cow to 30 days and then 
weaned  them off. The milk consumption  per calf was as low as 15 
gallons  in some instances.  We were very encouraged  by the results  and 
we are now developing  this work. In this way one could rear 50 or 
more calves per cow. Much of course,  depends  on the relative  price of 
milk and concentrate  feeding.

Suckling  for Beef
by

INTRODUCTION
Data have been accumulated  over the last three years on the perfor ­
mance  of different  breeds  and crosses,  and on the profitability  of different  
systems  of beef production  by the M.L.C.
In the first part of this paper the performance  of different  breeds  of 
bulls and cows in suckler  herds is discussed,  this is important  because 
the producer  of suckled  beef has an advantage  over producers  of beef 
on systems  dependant  upon purchasing  of stock, in that he has some  
control  over the genetic  raw material  he is working  with.
In the second part of the paper the results  achieved  in practice  and 
targets for suckler beef production  are discussed.  Throughout,  the 
suckler enterprise  is only considered  up to the production  of the 
weaned calf, the subsequent  fattening  of the weaned calves is not 
considerd.
PART  I
Breed of Sire
Table 1 shows the overall  effect of breed of sire on calf performance  
but takes no account  of variations  in the breed of cows used or 
difference  in environments  in which  the sire breeds  were used. However,

contemporary  comparison  analyses  confirm  not only the ranking  of the 
breeds  but also the magnitude  of differences  between  them.
Clearly  breed of sire has marked  influence  on calf performance  even 
at the fairly early 200 day stage.
The top group of breeds comprising  the South Devon, Sussex, 
Charolais,  Lincoln  Red and Devon,  produced  calves with average  200 
day weights  in the range 462-481  lb. Hereford  and Welsh  Black crosses  
averaged  420 lb. Aberdeen  Angus  crosses  were 24 lb. and Beef Shorthorn  
crosses 45 lb. lighter than Hereford  or Welsh Black crosses. The 
Galloway,  which should probably  not be regarded  as a top crossing  
sire, produced  the lightest  calves weighing  370 lb.
It is interesting  that the breed rankings  follow  closely  the ranking  of 
breeds  on the basis of their mean bull 400 day weights.  (Fig. 1).
This also shows the considerable  variation  in performance  within  
each of the breeds.  About 50 per cent of bulls licenced  in Britain in 
1969 will be weight  recorded.  It is important  that producers  use all the 
available  information  when purchasing  a herd sire.
Breed of Cow
There are numerous  types of cows used for suckled beef production  
both within  and between  herds. Results  indicate  the marked  superiority  
of the beef breed x Friesian  over the more traditional  beef cow 
typified  by the Blue-Grey;  Hereford  and Aberdeen  Angus  crosses  with 
the Ayrshire  and the Hereford  Dairy Shorthorn  also ranked above  
specialised  beef cows. (Table 2).

Within beef breed x Friesian  cows, the sire breeds in the cross  
ranked in much the same order as in the overall  analysis  of breed of 
sire on calf performance.
Type of Farms
The results  in Table 3 show the expected  decline  in calf performance  as 
the environment  worsens.  The decline from upland to hill farms is 
particularly  severe but is partly a function  of the breeds used on hill 
farms.
One interesting  feature  is that the decline  in performance  of heifer  
calves is less severe than for bull calves. This may reflect a greater  
resilience  in the female  under conditions  where nutrition  is inadequate.
Relationship  between  the Breed of Sire and Farm Situation
The ranking  of breeds  of bull and the magnitude  of difference  between 
breeds are not much influenced  by mating  with beef breed x Friesian  
on specialised  beef cows.
The ranking  of breeds of sire are the same on lowland,  upland  and 
hill farms but the difference  between  breeds  declined  on upland  farms  
and were reduced  appreciably  on hill farms. (Table  4).
Relationship  between  Breed of Cow and Farm Situation
The decline  in superiority  of the beef breed x Friesian  cow from low­
land to upland  farms is only slight (Table 5). However,  on hill farms  
the beef breed x Friesian  shows only a marginal  advantage  over the 
specialised  beef cow. This illustrates  the restricting  influence  which  
environment  places on the expression  of potential.
Relationship  between  Breed of Bull and Breed of Cow
The order of ranking  of sire breeds  is essentially  the same for matings  
with beef breed x Friesian  and specialised  beef cows. Table 5 also 
shows the consistent  superiority  of performance  of calves from beef 
breed x Friesian  cows referred  to earlier.
The three way cross appears  to have an advantage  (Table 6) over 
the two way cross. These are contemporaries;  the | Hereford  steer  
calves were 29 lb. lighter than ^ Hereford  steer calves at 200 days of 
age, the respective  difference  for heifer calves was 30 lb.
Conclusion  to Part I
Data coll le^ to date has been primarily  concerned  with liveweight 
gain of suckled calves. Obviously  other factors such as calving per­
centage  or ca’’ Tiortality  are of importance  as is the useful productive  
life of different  ,.rosses  of cow in different  environments.  Data are now 
being collected  oii these other characters.  Surprisingly  little is known  of 
the weight  of the various  cross bred cows and a weighing  programme

commenced  this Autumn  to collect information  on this point. This 
information  will be of value in determining  feed requirements  for 
different  types of cow. The most striking  finding  to date is the strong  
influence  of the sire breed on calf performance  during  a period when 
the dam has generally  been regarded  as having  the dominant  influence.  
Tn this respect  the moderate  ranking  of the Hereford,  numerically  the 
most important  beef breed,  is disappointing.
PART  II—Results  and Targets  for Lowland  Herds  
Liveweight  Gain
The choice of type of bull and cow in suckler beef production  is 
important  because  there is a close relationship  between  calf liveweight 
gains and gross margin.
Tables  7 and 8 show the results from recorded  herds m 1968. The 
top third herds produced  the highest output, both physically  and 
financially.  The difference  in the average weaning  weight of calves

between  the top and bottom  third herds was 108 lb. and the difference  
in output was £6 per cow. On average for every 0.1 lb. per day 
increase  in daily liveweight  gain in winter/spring  calving herds, the 
gross margin  was increased  by £1 18s.
Date of Calving  and Feed Costs
Table 9 shows the average  gross margin in 1968 for herds calving  in 
different  periods.  Autumn  calving  herds were the most profitable,  reflect ­
ing the greater  output  from these herds.
However,  date of calving  should be related to the individual  farm  
situation,  i.e., feed available,  buildings  and labour etc. If the right  
choice of calving period for a particular  farm is made, then gross 
margins  should not differ greatly  with calving  period.
Calving  periods  must be planned  and the bull should be allowed  to 
run with the herd for a limited  period only to ensure  calving  dates do 
not spread  throughout  the year. The herds with all year calving  had the 
lowest gross margins  per cow. Planned  calving  is necessary  for feed 
levels to be related  to the herd ’s need and also it ensures  even batches  
of calves at the sales.
Cow Feed Costs
It is essential  that the feeding  of the cow is related  to the date of calving. 
The aim with spring calving  cows should be to feed at maintenance  
level during the winter,  then gradually  increase  the level of nutrition  
during  the last month  of pregnancy.  Autumn  calving  cows must be fed 
on a sufficiently  high plane of nutrition  during  the winter to maintain  
milk yields. Results  for 1968 showed no relationship  between  feed 
costs per cow and the weight  of weaned  calf (Table 10) or the date of 
calving  (Table 11).
The results show that many autumn  calving  herds are being under  
fed during  the winter,  and that many spring  calving  herds are being over 
fed.
87
Creep  Feeding
Results  from different  farms both commercial  and experimental,  reflect  
differences  in response  to creep feeding.  The response  will be related to

the potential  for growth  of the calves and the milk yield of the cows.  
The overall  response  to creep feeding  in recorded  herds is plus 42 lb. 
for steers and plus 38 lb. for heifers.
The response  to creep feeding  is closely  related  to season  of calving 
and this factor  is important  in determining  the economics  of creep feed­
ing in the herd. (Table 12).

The response  to creep feeding  with calves born in the period  Decem- 
ber-May  is lower than the response  for calves  born in the period  June to 
November.  This is a reflection  of the age of the calf in relation  to the 
lactation  of its dam when creep feed is introduced.  Creep feeding  will 
generally  be justified  economically  in autumn  calving  herds, but should  
only be necessary  in limited  amounts  in spring  calving  herds. There is a 
strong need to improve  both grazing  and conservation  management,  
irrespective  of date of calving.

Cattle Production  from Grass  
and Silage on Irish Farms
by
M. Barlow
Department  Agriculture  and Fisheries,  Dublin
The wintering  of cattle is a very important  stage in any system of 
production.  There is a very close relationship  between  profitability  and 
liveweight  gain in wintering  systems,  especially  where low cost foods 
such as silage or hay form a large part of the diet. A simple  example  
will illustrate  this point. We all know that the price of cattle appreciates  
by 30/- per cwt. from Autumn  to Spring.  If an 8 cwt. bullock  puts on 
no weight  during  the winter he increases  in value by about £12 (8 x 
30/-).  Since it costs about  £10 to winter  this type of bullock  it is obvious 
that the margin  of £2 is not a very attractive  proposition.  Suppose  the 
same bullock  gained one cwt. in weight  during  the winter his increase 
in value is now in excess  of £20. It is important  to remember  that this 
cwt. increase  can be got from good silage or hay alone and so at little 
extra cost.
In order to find out the level of performance  obtained  on Irish farms,  
a survey was carried out during the winter of 1966/67.  Twenty  one 
farms in counties  Carlow,  Kilkenny,  Wexford,  Kildare,  Dublin,  Louth,  
Meath  and Westmeath,  wintering  almost  a thousand  cattle, participated  
in the survey.
There were 27 groups  of cattle in all, varying  in number  from 10 to 
128 and averaging  34. Most of the animals  were store bullocks  weighing  
from 7 to 9 cwts. There were a few groups  of weanlings.  The average 
feeding  period  was 107 days varying  from 41 to 148 days. All animals  
were individually  weighed  with a mobile scales shortly  after the start 
of winter  feeding  and again just before  winter  feeding  finished.
Feeding  Programme
The basic feeding  regime  for the 27 centres  was as follows;
(a) Self-fed  silage, 21 centres
(b) Silage and hay ration, three centres
(c) Hay and swedes,  one centre
(d) Hay only, one centre
(e) Barley  straw and swedes,  one centre.
Details  of the feeding  are given in Table 1.

Silage quality
At all centres,  with the exception  of two, silage was made in the con­
ventional  haybarn  roofed silo. There was no additive  used and no 
wilting  was carried  out. Silage  at all centres  was sampled  and chemieally 
analysed.  The range and average  chemical  analysis  of the silages was 
as follows:
Range Average
Dry matter  content  (percent)  ... .............. 16 to 24.8 18.5
Crude  protein  (percent  in dry matter)  .............. 9.4 to 16.1 11.8
Decomposed  Crude  Protein  (percent  in dry matter) 0.1 to 4.8 1.8
PH ......................................................................... 3.7 to 5.0 4.3
The average  dry matter at 18.5 per cent, must be considered  low 
especially  since much of the silage was made from fairly mature  grass.  
The crude protein  average  of 11.8 per cent., ineluding  decomposed  crude  
protein,  was also low. The ammonia  fraction  in many of the silages  
was much too high. Though  the average  PH of 4.3 was satisfactory  it 
was above  4.7 in 25 per cent, of the silages.
In addition  to the ehemical  analysis  a visual assessment  was made of 
all silages. With this information  on silage quality a prediction  was 
made of the expeeted  liveweight  gain at each centre.
Housing
All groups  of animals  with the exception  of one were housed  for the 
entire survey period. Most of the housing  consisted  of lean-to type 
sheds but there was much variation  in housing  conditions  between  
farms. The one outwintered  group had access to a well sheltered 
paddock.
Treatment  for Control  of Stomach  Worms  and Fluke
Three groups  were treated  twice and seven groups  treated  once for the 
control of liver fluke and stomach  worms. Two groups were treated  
once for fluke and one group  received  one treatment  for stomach  worms.  
Fourteen  of the twenty  seven groups  received  no treatment  whatsoever  
for the control  of stomach  worms  or liver fluke.
Results  of the Survey
The majority  of participants  in the survey  were interested  in obtaining  
substantial  liveweight  gains, as most of them hoped to sell their cattle  
out of the yards or after a short period at grass. (Table 2 contains  
details  of the survey).

Liveweight  Gain
The striking  feature  of the survey  results  was the poor liveweight  gains 
obtained.  In nine of the groups  the average  daily liveweight  gain was 
less than .20 lb. In 17 of the 27 groups,  there were some animals  which  
lost weight.  In fact, there were 12 groups  where 20 per cent, or more of 
the animals  lost weight.  Of the 10 groups  that were fed silage alone,  
the average  daily gain was less than .20 lb. in five of those. Only one of 
those silage alone groups  gained more than an average  of one lb. per 
day.
There were only five groups  in all where the average  daily gain was 
over one lb. per day. This very poor picture  of liveweight  performance  
is one of real concern.
Range  in Liveweight  Performance
The range in liveweight  performance  of animals  within groups was 
quite large. There were many groups in which the worst animals  lost 
I cwt. or more and the best animal  within the same group  gained  over 
one cwt.
Silage  Quality
As stated earlier the quality  of many of the silages was low. In fact, 
the quality  was rated poor in 40 per cent, of the cases. Undoubtedly  
many of the silages were far too mature when cut. However,  other  
major  causes  of the disappointing  quality  lay in the lack of application  
of known  practices  in silage making.  These  causes  were as follows:
1. Speed of filling —there were many instances  where it took up to 
two weeks to fill pits of 130 to 140 tons. It is almost  impossible  
to make high quality  silage in this way.
2. Soil contamination —this was evident in many of the pits. The 
reasons  for this were (a) large amounts  of soil brought  in to the 
dumping  area on the wheels  of tractors  in wet weather.  This soil 
eventually  gets into the pit.
3. Failure  to reduce  losses in the pit—it is necessary  to seal olT the 
pit quickly  and effectively.  Plastic sheeting  was not used in some 
silos. In some cases where it was used it was either put on two or 
three days after filling  or was not weighted  down properly.
Stomach,  Worm and Liver Fluke Treatment
On the basis of quality  of the foods fed, the performance  of nineteen  
of the twenty  seven groups  was below that expected.  It is interesting  to 
note that thirteen  of the fourteen  which received  no dosing  are to be 
found in this group of nineteen.  Of the eight groups  where production  
was as good as could be expected,  six of these were treated at least 
once for the control  of liver fluke and stomach  worms.

Some General  Comments
Only two groups  of animals  were treated  for the control  of lice. Lack  
of such control  could be responsible  for reduced  liveweight  gain in some 
cases. It is interesting  to note that within  groups,  there was no consistent  
relationships  between  production  and presence  of permanent  teeth at 
the start of winter  feeding.
At some centres where the results were disappointing  the silage  
appeared  very dense. Silage density  must be taken into account  when 
self feeding  if satisfactory  daily liveweight  gain is to be achieved.  The 
length of feeding  face appeared  to have limited intake and so reduced  
production  in some cases. The effect on production  of silage density  
and length of feeding  face are inter-dependent  and so should not be 
considered  in isolation.  The housing  conditions  were generally  adequate,  
except at three centres where very draughty  conditions  obtained.  At 
these three centres  production  was below that expected.
To sum up, I would say that the major  causes  of the poor production  
were as follows:
1. Poor silage quality.
2. Complete  lack of or inadequate  treatment  for liver fluke and 
stomach  worms.
3. Reduced  silage intake because  of silage density.
4. Absence  of lice control.
5. Draughty  housing.
As a follow-up  to the 1966-67 survey, a further programme  was 
planned  for the winter of 1967-68.  Unfortunately,  because  of the foot 
and mouth  outbreak  in the U.K. the restrictions  imposed  here lead to 
the abandoning  of the work and results are available  from only 11 
farms with 13 groups  of animals.
In the case of this 1967-68  project,  the aim was to ask co-operating  
farmers to follow certain guidelines  with respect to silage-making,  
cattle dosing  and general  husbandry,  and to see whether  it was possible 
to attain at farm level, the winter liveweight  gains which had been 
reported  by research  workers.
The results  can be briefly summarised  as follows:
99
1. There was a very substantial  improvement  in liveweight  gain. In 
over 50 per cent, of the groups  the liveweight  gain was in excess 
of one lb. per day.
2. A greatly  improved  approach  to the use of anthelmintics  obtained.
3. Though  the average  dry matter, crude protein and PH of the 
silages  differed  only slightly  from the survey  figures  the quality  was 
greatly  improved.  This was because  much greater  care was taken  
at silage making  time.
4. The range in performance  of animals  within groups  was reduced 
to reasonable  proportions.
5. There were only two centres where animals  lost weight. These, 
incidentally,  were at the only two centres  where the silage fermen ­
tation was rated poor.
To obtain satisfactory  liveweight  gain from self-feed  silage it is 
necessary  to provide  a good quality  silage with adequate  feeding  face 
per animal  taking  into account  silage density.  In addition  to the normal  
day to day management/husbandry  practices,  it is important  that a 
proper programme  for the control  of stomach  worms,  liver fluke and 
lice be carried  out.
The very poor production  obtaining  on very many farms can be 
substantially  and quickly  improved  by simple attention  to some vital 
husbandry  factors.  It is important  that this improved  production  takes  
place quickly.
In conclusion  Table 3 gives a brief outline  of some of the results  to 
date from the grazing  animal.  These figures show that we have been 
more successful  with the grazing  animal  than with the silage fed animal  
in our efforts  to achieve  satisfactory  liveweight  gains.

Beef for the Mid-Seventies
by
Michael  Carroll
Meat Research  Department,  The Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea.
The question  is what kind of beef carcases  will be required  for the 
nineteen  seventies?  I will attempt  to answer  this question  by listing  the 
carcase  characteristics  which might be taken into consideration  when  
evaluating  beef in the next decade  and then discuss  each characteristic  
in turn. As a result of this discussion,  1 hope to be able to suggest  to 
you what kind of beef is going to be needed  for the future.
The characteristics,  which might be considered  in carcase  evaluation  
are;
1. Carcase  weight
2. Carcase  composition
3. Carcase  conformation
4. Meat quality
(a) Colour  of fat and lean when fresh
(b) Waterholding  capacity  of lean when fresh and cooked
(c) Tenderness  of lean when cooked
(d) Juiciness  of meat when cooked
(e) Flavour  of meat when cooked
Carcase  weight
The method  of retail cutting  practiced  in the British Isles demands  a 
relatively  light carcase  of about 500 lb. if the rolled roasts from along 
the back are to have a reasonable  depth when cut into family joints. 
The heavier  the carcase  the shallower  the rolled roast must be for any 
given joint weight.  Of course,  this problem  does not arise when you 
are providing  roasts for the catering  trade.
About thirty three per cent, of a carcase  goes into roasting  joints  
and carcase  weight  has no effect on the quality  of the other joints. So 
one can assume  that in the British Isles the retail butcher  demands  a 
light carcase  because  small roasts  of depth  can be cut from it. However,  
another  factor, which retail butchers  may sub-consciously  be taking  
into consideration  in demanding  light carcases  is that within the same  
breed or cross and sex the heavier  the carcase  the fatter it is.
On the other hand, the French  method  of cutting  for the retail trade  
demands  a heavy  carcase  of about 800 lb. The reasons  for this are :
102
(a) Their method  of cutting  is virtually  a muscle  by muscle  dissec ­
tion of the carcase.  The smaller  muscles  make reasonable  joints  
from 800 lb. carcases,  but are hopelessly  thin from light carcases.
(b) With this method  of cutting  the same amount  of skilled labour  
goes into cutting  a carcase  whether  it is light or heavy.
(c) The French in their beef demand  the full-bodied  beef flavour,
which can only be had from mature  animals.
If a dropped  calf costs twenty  pounds  (400 shillings)  and the animal  
is killed at 400 lb. carcase  weight  then the charge  on the carcase  for the 
calf is a shilling  a pound.  If killed at 600 lb. carcase  weight,  it is eight  
pence a pound and six pence a pound if killed at 800 lb. There are 
other economic  considerations  to be taken into consideration  when look­
ing at the economics  of producing  carcases  of different  weights,  but 
often get the impression  that the differential  paid for light carcases  may 
not be enough  to cover the extra costs. ^ ^
I think more and more in the future, farmers  will be inclined  to 
market  their cattle at carcase  weights  which give lean meat production  
at the least cost per pound and they will only be willmg to change  
from this if the butcher  is willing  to pay a worthwhile  differential  tor 
lighter or heavier  carcases.  Butchers  may find that they will not be 
able to afford to pay this differential  for what may be a marginal  
difference  in quality  namely,  the depth of a rolled roast of beef.
Carcase  composition;  fat; lean; bone
To illustrate  the prrints I wish to make about carcase  composition  an 
conformation  I am going to use data from Dr. Harte ’s* experiments,  
which were carried  out at Grange  Research  Station  of the Agricultura  
Institute.  In these experiments,  he was comparing  the Performance  of 
Friesian,  Hereford  X Shorthorn  and Aberdeen  Angus X Shorthorn  
bullocks.  See Table 1. In experiment  one, the Friesian  Hereford  Cross  
and Aberdeen  Angus Cross animals  were killed at 1,200, 1,100 ana 
1,000 lb. liveweight  respectively.  In experiment  two, the animals  were 
killed at an equal age of 737 days.
Carcase  composition
The carcase  composition  of these animals  are given m Table 2. brom  
this table, it can be seen that the fatter the animal,  the less lean in the 
carcase Any method  of carcase  grading,  which  gives marks  for fat over 
and above that amount of fat, which is required  for cooking,  is 
bound  to be unrealistic  as it is favouring  a reduction  in lean percentage.  
There is a great need at the moment  for a detailed  market  survey on 
carcase  fat requirements  and the price differential  that would be paid 
for carcases  of different  fatness.

efficiency  in cattle production.  Ph.D. thesis,  University  of Dublin,  1966.
103
An increase  in bone in the carcase  decreased  the amount  of lean in 
the carcase  in exactly  the same proportion  as does an increase  in fat 
of the same amount. Despite this, butchers  seem to down grade  
heavy boned animals  much more than fat animals.  Also, the fatter the 
animal  the less bones will be in a carcase.  In comparing  the bone size 
of breeds  of animals  I think it is very important  to compare  them on a 
muscle  to bone ratio basis. In Table 3, 1 have calculated  the carcase  
composition,  disregarding  fat and I have calculated  the “lean” to bone  
ratio. You will see how the Friesians  compare  unfavourably  with the 
other two breed crosses,  but because  they have less fat in their carcases,  
they have a much more favourable  lean content  (see Table 2).
Carcase  conformation
All lean in a carcase  is not of equal commercial  value. The roasting  
meat is of less value per pound than the frying meat and the stewing  
meat is of less value still. Because  of this, the animal  with the highest 
percentage  of its total lean in the expensive  cuts is the best. This is one 
of the basis on which live animals  and carcase  conformation  is judged. 
In Table 4, I have calculated  the lean in each cut as a percentage  of 
total lean in the carcase  for the three types of animal.
It is obvious  that there is very little if any difference  between  these  
three types of animal  when conformation  is accessed  in this way. The 
Aberdeen  Angus  crosses  have significantly  more round than the Here- 
fords in experiment  one and less shin than the Friesians  in experiment  
two. Good points in favour of the Aberdeen  Angus crosses. The 
Friesians  have significantly  less flap in both experiments  and less clod 
and sticking  in experiment  two both credit points to the Friesians  as 
these are cheap  cuts.
Conformation  may also be measured  in a different  way. It is possible  
to have two animals  with the same percentage  of total carcase  lean in 
the round or along the expensive  cuts of the back but having  different  
lengths  of leg or back. The animal with the shortest  length will have 
the thickest  fleshing.  This may be a quality factor. I doubt if it is 
important  in beef cattle where one side may be cut into as many a 
50-100  family  joints. It could be more important  in lamb and pork.
Meat Quality
Some people speak about carcase  quality  as if it were independent  of 
meat quality  which it is not. Meat quality  is an important  factor in 
carcase  quality.
Colour  of fat
In most markets,  a pale creamy  fat colour  is sought  after. Excessively 
yellow fat is undesirable  and the consumer  may associate  it with cow 
beef.

Colour  of lean when fresh and cooked
Colour of lean when fresh is most important  as the housewife  is 
attracted  by cherry  red colour  at the point of sale. I think we will hear 
a lot more about this colour in the next decade because  colour fade 
in prepacked  fresh meat is one of the limiting  factors  in the shelf life 
of the prepacked  product.  Lengthening  the shelf life of prepacked  fresh  
meat is the challenge  of the moment.
We do not know nearly  enough  about the factors  affecting  colour  in 
beef although  we do know that the method of slaughter  in pigs 
influences  the colour.  In fact, by measuring  the acidity  of pork within 
an hour after death,  you can predict  with reasonable  accuracy  what the 
colour  of the fresh pork will be days later. We do know that this same  
measurement  taken 24 hours after slaughter  tells us a lot about the 
colour  of the fresh beef, but it may not tell us everything.
106
Colour  of the lean when cooked
You all know the story of the objection  to the pale colour of barley  
beef when cooked.  How acceptable  this is compared  with the dar^r  
colour of meat from more mature animals,  it is hard to tell. My 
opinion,  for what it is worth, is that barley beef is acceptable  to a 
certain market where its tenderness  characteristics  outweigh  the dis­
advantage  of its lack of maturity.
Waterholding  capacity 'can
The waterholding  capacity  of meat is important  firsUy, because,  if it is 
poor the freshly cut meat will ooze bloody looking  moisture  when  
displayed  for sale or prepacked.  Secondly,  there will be excessive  coo 
ing losses and the meat will not be good for canning  and sausage  
making.  As in the case of colour of the fresh meat, the published  
literature  on the factors influencing  the waterholding  of pork meat is 
far more extensive  than in the case of beef, although  some private  com­
panies may have considerable  informaton  on beef. As m the case with 
colour in pork, the acidity of the meat soon after slaughter  will in­
dicate whether  the waterholding  capacity  of the meat will be good or 
not. It is not known  whether  this holds good for beef or not, but it 
is known  that low acidity  twenty-four  hours after slaughter  is associated  
with dark coloured  sticky beef, which has a high waterholding  capacity.
Tenderness
I need not emphasise  how important  a quality  tenderness  is. However,  
there is need for market  research  work to be carried  out, which would 
answer  the question  ; What is the relative  importance  to the consumer  ot
tenderness  as compared  to flavour?  , . . ^In America,  it is well established  that the British  Breeds  of beef cattle  
are more tender than cattle with Bramen  blood and there are indica ­
tions that, within  breed,  tenderness  is an inherited  character.
A former  colleague  of mine in the Agricultural  Institute,  Dr. Hill, 
has shown why beef gets tougher  as the animal  gets older. Collagen,  of 
which connective  tissue is made, is responsible  for a considerable  
amount  of the toughness  of meat. On cooking  in the presence  ot 
moisture,  the collagen  turns to gelatin.  Dr. Hill has shown that as the 
animal  gets older, the solubility  of the collagen  decreases.  This means  
that in cooking,  less of the tough  collagen  is converted  to gelatin.
There is conflicting  evidence  on the role of marbling  fat in influenc ­
ing toughness  in meat. There seems to be little reason why it should 
influence  the toughness  of meat. Whether  marbling  influences  the juici­
ness of meat is also open to question.  We, in the Agricultural  Institute  
regard toughness  as a wide open field for research.
107
Flavour
Flavour  is important,  but how important  compared  with tenderness  or 
colour  of the fresh meat needs to be answered  by the market  research  
people.  1 know little about it that I can usefully  discuss  with you today.
Beef for the nineteen  seventies  will be that which  can be produced  at 
the lowest cost per pound of lean taking into consideration  the costs 
from conception  to consumption.  The carcases  will have to be classified  
so that they can be bought  internationally  on the ’phone.  This classifica­
tion will be based on:
1. Carcase  weight.
2. Sex.
3. An accurate  assessment  of the carcase  fat percentage  and some  
measure  of the fat cover distribution.
4. The age of the animal.  It may be necessary  to leave the teeth  
hanging  on the carcase  for this purpose.  Or maybe the age may 
be obtained  from the ear tag.
5. A measure  of acidity  at slaughter  or twenty-four  hours afterwards  
or both.
6. If by the 1970s, butchers  think that thickness  of fleshing  is impor ­
tant in a beef carcase  and are prepared  to pay a differential  for it 
then it may be necessary  to describe  the amount  of lean meat in 
the carcase  per inch of length  of back or leg.

The Price Difference  between  
British and Irish Fat Cattle
by
Michael  J. Behan
Department  of Applied  Agricultural  Economics.  University  College,  
Dublin  (now with Irish Livestock  and Meat Commission)
Cattle are produced  in Ireland for both the home and the export  
market,  mainly the United Kingdom.  In recent years total exports,  
including  stores,  live fats and carcase  beef, amounted  to 80 per cent, of 
total cattle output. Store cattle are usually Ireland ’s most important  
export. For example,  in 1967 618,000  stores were exported,  earning  
£40.5 million. This store trade is a very old one (1). Despite its 
traditional  nature and its importance  to Irish farmers  and the Irish  
economy,  relatively  little is known  by non-participants  about its opera ­
tion and efficiency.  While such a long established  trade is not likely  
to vanish overnight,  there are certain trends in consumer  preferences 
that may adversely  affect it in the future.  One of these is the preference  
for lighter  carcases.  The more prosperous  consumer  of to-day  demands  
better quality  food. The trend in demand  for beef is for leaner and 
more tender  meat. These qualities  are more likely to be obtained  in the 
young intensively-fed  animal than in the traditional  slowly grown 
Irish store (2). English  butchers,  who are buying to cater for their 
customers,  express  a growing  preference  for the nicely finished  nine 
cwt. bullock  by paying  an increasing  premium  per cwt. for them (1).
In view of this preference  it is reasonable  to enquire  if Irish stores 
are too heavy for the British market?  Will the traditional  forward  
store become  obsolete  as more affluent  housewives  seek younger  beef  ? 
On the other hand, if Irish farmers  produce  the younger  animal will 
it be suitable  for the traditional  feeder  of Irish stores?  The aim of this 
study was to assemble  information  on price by weight of Irish and 
British cattle and to assess the extent of the price gap that existed in 
1666 between  the prices paid to Irish and U.K. farmers.
The Price Gap between  British-fattened  Irish stores and home-bred  
animals
Data were collected  on the weights  and prices of Irish store bullocks  
fattened  in Northumberland  and the border  counties  (2) and of home ­
bred cattle fattened  in the same area. This area is a major importer  of 
Irish store cattle taking  between  15 and 20 per cent, of our total store

bullocks  and Qj-ll cwt. bullocks  (reported  in the Agricultural  Market  Report,  
produced  by the Ministry  of Agriculture,  Fisheries  and Food) has widened.

Lothians  and Fife.
no
exports annually  (3). The data consisted  of a sample of the 1966 
records  of a livestock  auction  market  at Edinburgh  and of a slaughter ­
house at Wooler  in Northumberland,  one of a national  network.
The sampling  density differed by market because of the wide 
differences  in the throughputs.  The average weekly throughput  at 
Edinburgh  was approximately  200, 25 per cent, being of Irish origin. 
The slaughterhouse  at Wooler  had an average  weekly throughput  of 
40 bullocks,  with varying  proportions  of fattened  Irish steers. A 20 
per cent, sample of home-bred  cattle and a 50 per cent, sample of 
fattened  Irish stores were taken at Edinburgh  for every second week  
throughout  the year. All the records  for alternate  weeks of 1966 were 
used in the case of the Wooler  slaughterhouse.  Heifers  were excluded  
in all cases since the number  of heifers of Irish origin was minute  
relative  to home-bred  heifers. Records  were collected  for a total of 
2,000 cattle, half of which were sold on a liveweight  and half on a 
deadweight  basis. The numbers  were also evenly divided  according  to 
country  of origin.
Results
Irish cattle at Edinburgh  averaged  10.8 cwt. compared  with 9.4 cwt. for 
home-breds;  the corresponding  average  carcase  weights  at Wooler  were 
677 lb. and 567 lb., respectively.  The heavier  weight  of Irish cattle is 
well known and compares  with the average  weight of store bullocks  
sold in Dublin,  at approximately  nine cwt. The average  weights  of 
fattened  Irish and home-bred  bullocks  at Edinburgh  and of store cattle  
at Dublin  are presented  in Table 1, and the corresponding  Wooler  data 
are given in Appendix  Table 1.
The weights  of Irish stores at Dublin  varies by season,  being highest 
in the Autumn  at 9.5 to 10.0 cwt. and lowest in the Spring  months  at 
about 8.25 cwt. No such seasonal  pattern  is evident  in the weights  of 
fattened  Irish cattle sold at Edinburgh  and Wooler.  It would appear  
that British farmers  carry Irish stores to about the same weight re­
gardless  of the weight at time of purchase.  This involves  putting  on 
much more weight on spring purchased  stores than on autumn pur­
chased  ones, which is easy to do in any case because  the spring  store is 
typically  leaner and emptier  than the autumn  animal.  The large weight 
gains are probably  necessary  to secure a satisfactory  degree of finish.  
It is also probably  necessary  to put more weight on the spring store  
which is purchased  at a high per cwt. price and sold on the falling  
summer  market,  in order to maintain  profit margins.  In contrast  to the 
uniform  seasonal  weights  of Irish cattle, home-breds  tend to be heavier  
in the spring than in the autumn.  This is possibly  attributable  to the 
better finish on shed-fed  animals  sold in the spring than on grass-fed 
animals  sold in the autumn.
Irish cattle sold on average  for 17/6d. per cwt. less than British,  
the prices being 173/3d. and 190/9d.  per cwt. respectively.  The dead ­
weight price of fattened  Irish bullocks  was 33.5d. per lb. as against
111
36.3d. per lb for home-bred  bullocks,  an average  price differential  of 
2.8d. per lb. The principal  reason for this price penalty  against Irish 
cattle is their heavier  weight.  Other  contributory  factors  are; the time of 
marketing  and the high incidence  of liver fluke in fattened  Irish stores. 
The prices of both categories  of cattle and their associated  differentials  
for Edinburgh  and Wooler  are presented  in Table 2 and Appendix  
Table 2, respectively.
It is well known that as the weight of cattle increases  the price per 
cwt. usually  falls. The edinburgh  data were classified  by weight into 
three categories,  viz. under 8.5 cwt., 8.5 to 10.5 cwt. and over 10.5 
cwt., and the average  price for all cattle in each category  calculated.  
The results,  together  with the distribution  of Irish and British cattle  
by weight  category,  are shown in Table 3.
The heavier  weight  of Irish cattle is also evident  from Table 3 where 
nearly 60 per cent, of the cattle of Irish origin exceeded  10.5 cwt.,  
whereas  only 13.5 per cent, of the home-bred  cattle fell into this 
category.  Deadweight  prices and weight  distribution  at Wooler  showed  
a similar  pattern,  as may be seen in Appendix  Table 3.
When the price of fattened  Irish cattle was compared  with home-  
breds of similar  weight,  the price differential  between  the two types 
was insignificant.  If anything  Irish sold at a premium.  The prices of 
Irish and home-bred  cattle are plotted  against  their weight  in Figure 1.

Both categories  of cattle have a weight at which the price per cwt. 
is a maximum.  For British  cattle this is around  8.5 to 9.0 cwt. and for 
Irish cattle it is around  10.0 to 10.5 cwt. Below these weight  ranges  the 
price per cwt. is lower,  presumably  because  of lack of finish,  and above 
these ranges  there is a price penalty,  presumably  because  the cattle are 
overfat.
The price differential  between  home-bred  and British-fattened  Irish 
cattle is higher in the autumn  when cattle prices generally  are lowest  
than it is in the spring.  From the data in Table 2 and Appendix  Table  
2 the average  differentials  for the first and second  halves  of the year can 
be calculated  as 8/6d. per cwt. and 21/6d. per cwt., respectively,  at 
Edinburgh,  and 1.7d. per lb. and 2.4d. per lb. respectively,  at Wooler. 
The reasons  for this seasonal  price pattern  are probably  a mixture  of 
price levelling  by butchers  and factories,  i.e. taking low profit margins  
when cattle prices  are high and substantially  higher  margins  when cattle  
prices decline,  thus eliminating  large fluctuations  in retail prices,  and of 
reduced  discernment  by consumers  when prices are high. The majority  
of fattened  Irish stores in the U.K. are marketed  in the latter half of 
the year when the price differential  is highest.  For example,  in 1966 
68.2 per cent, of fattened  Irish stores were marketed  in the second  half 
of the year (4). The change in the price gap between  spring and 
autumn  is not solely a seasonal  phenomenon  since the average  weight  
gap between  the two categories  of cattle also widens  in the latter half 
of the year, as can be seen from Table 1 and Appendix  Table 1.
The high incidence  of liver fluke in Irish cattle is well known,  and 
all cattle whether  infected  or not tend to be penalised  on account  of 
this disease  (5). For example,  all Irish cattle sold on a deadweight  basis
114
are penalised  0.25 pence per pound. The annual national  loss at this 
rate would approximate  £900,000,  since undoubtedly  British  purchasers  
of Irish stores pass the penalty  back to Irish producers,  as do buyers  
on the domestic  market.
The Price Gap between  Britain  and Ireland
In addition  to the price gap that exists between  prices paid for 
home-bred  and British fattened Irish cattle, there is also a gap 
between  the average  Dublin fat cattle price and average  U.K. prices.  
It has been alleged from time to time that the price gap between 
Dublin and the U.K. is higher than is warranted  by transport  and 
marketing  costs. In particular,  exporters  have been accused  of weak 
selling on the U.K. market and of dumping  cattle and beef on the 
market  when it is glutted,  thereby  reducing  the returns  to Irish farmers.
Part of the evidence  used to justify this argument  is the difference 
that exists between  the average  price, inclusive  of subsidy,  paid to 
U.K. farmers  for all fat cattle qualifying  for the Fatstock  Guarantee  
Payment,  and the price of fat cattle at the Dublin  market.  This price 
differential  varies considerably  over time. The average  differentials  for 
each of the five years 1963 to 1967 were 43/9d.,  25/-d.,  21/-d., 32/-d.,  
and 38/3d. per cwt., respectively.  The average  differential  for the five 
year period was 32/- per cwt. If these statistical  comparisons  were 
valid, then it would appear  that Irish farmers  have a genuine  grievance. 
The widening  of the price gap in the latter half of 1966, associated  
with the depressed  state of the market  in that year, would seem to be 
evidence  of the alleged  weak selling.  There were many abnormal  factors  
operating  at that time however.
The British beef and cattle market  was under unusual  pressure  from  
supplies  diverted  from the self-sufficient  E.E.C.  market  and from record  
home production;  while demand  was depressed  by a tight credit situa ­
tion, and reduced  home consumption  of beef. In addition,  there was 
a U.K. shipping  strike in May and June followed  by a bank strike in 
this country.
Apart from the abnormality  of the market in the second half of 
1966, the comparability  of the average  price paid to U.K. farmers  and 
the price of fat cattle at Dublin  is questionable.  The price of fat cattle in 
Dublin,  although  an aggregate  of the prices of bullocks,  heifers,  bulls 
and cows in a single market  only, is a reasonably  accurate  indicator  
of what factories  pay for fat cattle destined  for the British con­
sumer (3). This price would have reflected  the subsidy  paid on all beef 
cattle slaughtered  for the U.K. market  in 1966 and the headage  pay­
ment made on all live fat exports  to the U.K. market  during  the period  
31st August  to 5th December  of that year.
3. In 1966 the Dublin  fat cattle price showed  little or no variation  from other  
published  fat cattle prices,  such as the price of 10-11 cwt. bullocks  at Dublin  
store sales and 2-3 year-old  cattle at fairs and marts.
115
On the other hand, the price paid to U.K. farmers  for all cattle is 
an average  over a large number  of geographically  dispersed  markets  and 
a wide range of cattle types. It encompasses,  for example,  the lighter, 
earlier finished home-breds  and the heavier and older Irish reared,  
British  finished  cattle. The price to the British  farmer  also included  the 
full Fatstock  Guarantee  Payment.  It is unlikely,  therefore,  that these two 
prices are comparable.
Conceptually  the differential  between the price received by Irish 
producers  for cattle slaughtered  in Ireland  for the U.K. market  and the 
price received  by British producers  for home-finished  animals  can be 
divided  into five components,  as follows:
1. transport  and handling  costs including  agents ’ margins;
2. processing  and marketing  cost differences  between Ireland and 
Britain;
3. quality  differences  between  Irish cattle killed in Ireland and in 
Britain;
4. quality differences  between Irish cattle killed in Britain and 
British  cattle;  and
5. distributor  or consumer  prejudice.
Transport  and handling  costs for cattle between  Ireland  and Britain  
can be estimated  fairly closely.  This cost varies according  to place of 
dispatch  and final destination,  but in 1966 it was between  15/- and 
20/- per live cwt. (6). Uikewise,  in the case of carcase  beef transport  
and handling  costs vary according  to destination  and type of outlet. 
For example,  a commission  of 4.5 to 5.0 per cent, has to be paid on 
all beef sold at wholesale  markets.  Beef delivered  direct to distributors  
probably  incurs a higher  delivery  cost than that destined  for wholesale  
markets.  Consequently,  the handling  and transport  costs (4) for carcase  
beef varies between 2d. and 4d. per pound deadweight.  No such 
eivdence  is available  on processing  and marketing  costs, but it is 
reasonable  to hypothesise  that any difference  that exists favours  the 
Irish factories.  The price differential  between British fattened Irish 
bullocks  and their home-bred  counterparts  at Edinburgh  and Wooler  
is some indication  of the importance  of quality  differences.
Since there were substantial  differences  between  the prices paid for 
fattened  home-bred  and fattened  Irish cattle at Edinburgh  and Wooler,  
namely  17/6d. per cwt. and 2.8d. per lb., respectively,  it appears  that 
it would be more nearly comparing  like with like if the Dublin fat 
cattle price was contrasted  with the average  price for fattened  Irish 
stores in the U.K.
4. In addition  to the actual  transport  cost, loss for shrinkage  in transit,  the cost
of ice, muslin,  insurance  and possible  commission  are included.
116
The Real Price Gap
If it is assumed  that the differences  at Edinburgh  and Wooler  are 
representative  of the British market  as a whole, it is possible  to cal­
culate the “real” price gap between  Ireland and the U.K. It is not 
certain that the two markets  studied are representative  of the overall  
U.K. market,  but they are probably  reasonably  representative  of those  
areas in the U.K. where Irish stores are fattened in appreciable  
numbers  and this is the segment  of the market  relevant  to the present  
discussion.  The area serviced  by the two centres  studied  takes about  
20 per cent, of Irish store exports  annually  and there is no evidence  
to suggest  that either Irish or British  cattle in this area are atypical  for 
the country  as a whole.
The average  price of fat cattle at Dublin in 1966 was 148/3d. per 
cwt. Average  U.K. returns  for fat cattle in the same year were 180/3d.  
per cwt. so that the apparent  gap was 32/- per cwt. Assuming  that the 
l7/6d. per cwt. differential  at Edinburgh  is representative  of the 
national  situation,  the weighted  average  price of fattened  Irish stores  
in the U.K. as a whole was 164/6d.  in 1966 (5). Therefore,  with these 
assumptions  the “real” price gap in 1966 was not 32/- but only 16/3d.  
per cwt.
If it is further assumed  that the 17/6d. price differential  between 
British  fattened  Irish cattle and home-bred  animals  is constant  from one 
year to the next, the “real” price gap for the period 1963-67  would 
also have been close to 16/- per cwt. on average.  The data for each 
of the years are presented  in Table 4. Since cattle prices and differen ­
tials fluctuate  widely from year to year, this figure of 17/6d. is also 
likely to vary considerably.  However,  even if the figure was as much as 
25 per cent, lower, the real gap would still only be 20/- which leaves  
little room for major inefficiencies.
The estimated  real price differentials  presented  in Table 4 would be 
just about sufficient  on average  to cover marketing  and transport  costs,  
so that—in so far as the evidence  goes—it does not suggest  an un­
warranted  gap between  prices of Irish fat cattle in Dublin and in 
Britain.  Therefore,  the price paid in Dublin  appears  to have been at a 
reasonable  level.
The availability  of suitable  data makes  deadweight  price comparisons  
between  Ireland and the U.K. even more hazardous  than is the case 
for live cattle; nevertheless,  some estimates  are possible.  Two major  
assumptions  are necessary,  firstly that the price paid for fattened  Irish  
cattle slaughtered  at Wooler  is representative  of the national  situation  
for all fattened  Irish cattle sold by deadweight;  and secondly,  that the
5. The weighting  factor used was 10 per cent, on the assumption  that Irish  
comprise  10 per cent, of total fatstock  certifications.  Even if the figure in any 
year was as high as 15 per cent, of total certifications,  the effect on the 
estimated  price of fattened  Irish stores would be less than 1/- per cwt.

to Irish farmers.  The data for the carcase  price comparisons  are pre­
sented in Table 5.

The price gap shown in Table 5, which averaged  4.3d. for the 
year, makes no allowance  for transport  and handling  costs between 
Ireland  and Britain.  It has been estimated  above that this cost varies  
between  2d. and 4d. per lb. deadweight  depending  on the destination  of 
the meat and the type of outlet through  which it is marketed.  If it is
118
average  price gap net of transport  costs is 1.3d. per lb. This gap of 
assumed  that the average transport  cost is 3d. per lb. the annual  
1.3d. per lb. may be due to Irish killed beef selling at a discount  in 
Britain relative  to beef from fattened  Irish cattle slaughtered  in the 
U.K., or as a result of Irish factories  being less efficient  or making  
greater  profits  than their British  counterparts.  The price gap varies  from  
one period  of the year to the next, being greatest  in autumn  when prices 
are low, and least in spring the period of high prices. This indicates  
that factories  practise  price levelling,  taking  a loss or very much reduced  
profits  when prices are high and greater  than normal  profits  when prices 
are low.
If the comparisons  made at Edinburgh  reflect the situation  at live­
stock marts in general and the Wooler comparison  represents  the 
picture for all factories,  it appears  that there is not as large a price 
gap between  the price of fat cattle in Dublin  and the U.K. as is often  
alleged.  Nevertheless,  the analysis  presented  is far from complete;  for 
example,  it could hardly be taken to represent  Smithfield,  where weak 
selling of Irish beef is frequently  alleged and no doubt occurs on 
occasion.  In addition,  price parity with U.K. home production  should  
not be accep'ed  as the optimum  situation.  It may be possible  to achieve  
a premium  for Irish beef.

The Availability  of Dairy  
By-Products  for Feeding  to 
Farm Animals

Introduction
It is unnecessary  to stress the importance  of the Irish Livestock  industry  
to the national  economy,  particularly  in the light of recent develop ­
ments in price supports  for agriculture.  Because  of the importance  of 
the livestock  industry  it is essential  to avoid, as far as possible,  any­
thing which will seriously  upset it. This on the other hand must be 
balanced  as far as possible  with the necessity  to develop  an efficient  and 
progressive  dairy products  industry.  It is, in a large measure,  through  
the development  and maintainence  of a highly successful  dairy products  
industry  that the dairy farmer  is guaranteed  his income  and will continue  
to make available  the large numbers  of calves  required  for the livestock 
trade.
To operate  a successful  dairy products  industry,  both in terms of 
internal  efficiency  and in the context  of exporting  a substantial  volume  
of its products,  requires  as great a range of products  as possible.  This 
involves  the utilisation  of a substantial  amount  of skim milk both in 
whole milk and skim milk products.  From the point of view of 
establishing  and retaining  Ireland as a force in international  dairy  
product  markets  it is important  that all major products,  at least, be 
manufactured  and sold even when the return is not so satisfactory.
Skim Availability
In recent years this has led to an extension  in the manufacture  of 
cheese,  skim milk powder  and chocolate  crumb with the result that a 
smaller  proportion  of skim than heretofore  has been returned  to farms.  
Even with the frequently-quoted  “skim milk powder  crisis ” the total 
proportion  of skim returned  to farms in 1968 as compared  with 1967 
was only marginally  higher up to mid-October.  This of course  is taking  
skim returned  to farms as a percentage  of total intake of whole milk.  
The relevant  figures  were 43.6 per cent, in 1968 and 41.6 per cent, in 
1967. When total quantities  are taken into account  the figures  are quite  
different  because  of the significant  increase  in intake in 1968. Up to
123
mid-October  this year 183.5 million gallons of skim were returned  
compared  with 159.2 million  gallons  in the same period in 1967.
If the same rate of return to farms continues  up to the end of March  
(i.e. the end of the 1968 milk year) then it seems that a total of 
approximately  225 million  gallons  of skim will have been made avail ­
able for on-farm  feeding  of livestock.  This compares  with approximately  
190 million  gallons  in both 1966 and 1967. One of the problems,  how­
ever, is to establish  precisely  what the demand  is for skim at farm level.  
Essentially  the determining  factor is the price at which skim can be sold 
to the local creamery  but it would appear  that there are other factors  
involved.  Included  in these no doubt is the question  of the convenience 
of selling all the milk to the creamery,  particularly  if can washing 
facilities  are available.  1 will refer more specifically  later on to the 
question  of the demand  for skim but it is sufficient  at this stage to 
point out that the level is far from clear and perhaps  not in any way 
constant.
Location  of Skim Supply
Information  on the exact amount  of skim returned  to farmers  in any 
given year is not readily  available  for each creamery  area or even each 
county.  It seems, however,  that, if the suggested  figure of 225 million 
gallons is returned  to farmers in the 1968 milk season, it will be 
distributed  throughout  the provinces  roughly  as follows:
Munster
Leinster
Connaught
Ulster150 m. gallons  
32 m. gallons 
32 m. gallons  
11 m. gallons
225 m. gallons
This distribution  is based on the experience  up to mid-October.  In 
the case of Munster,  it is reasonable  to assume  that very little skim was 
returned  to farmers  in the areas served by Ballyclough,  Mitchelstown  
and Waterford  co-operatives.  It is equally  likely that the percentage 
returned  to farmers  in the area served by the member  creameries  of the 
Golden  Vale federation  was not particularly  high either.  As a result the 
total skim returned  to farmers  in other Munster  areas must have been 
considerably  higher than the average  for Munster  as a whole. It is 
worth pointing  out, in passing,  that in the three Ulster counties  the 
quantity  of skim returned  to farmers  as a percentage  of total intake is 
lower than in any of the other provinces.  Furthermore  the average  price  
received  by producers  for their skim has, throughout  1968, been con­
siderably  higher  in the three Ulster  counties  than in any other province.
124
Demand  for Skim
As mentioned  earlier  it is extremely  difficult  to estimate  precisely  what  
the demand  is for skim for animal feeding.  In 1967 in a document  
prepared  by the Department  of Agriculture  for the N.A.C. it was 
assumed  that it would be very difficult  to convince  farmers  to use a 
greater  quantity  than was then being used, i.e. 190 million  gallons  per 
annum.  In fact this document  pointed  out that in 1967 farmers  would 
probably  not have utilised that much if all creameries  were able to 
obtain a market for the skim. The Department  considered  at that 
stage that the quantity  of skim being returned  was adequate  to meet  
the existing  demand.  This, however,  was before the real selling crisis 
for skim milk powder  became  effective.  The price available  for skim 
milk as a result was at least Id. per gallon higher  on average,  than it is 
now or even was throughout  most of the year.
In a further  document  prepared  by the Department  of Agriculture  
in May 1968 when the price available  for skim powder  and as a result  
skim milk, had dropped  considerably,  a different  point of view is 
stressed.  This document  sets out to show desirable  levels of feeding  to 
calves, pigs and sows at differing  values for skim. These levels of 
feeding  are then applied to the existing  livestock  numbers  in each 
county and as a result a theoretical  demand  is calculated  for the 
different  value levels of skim milk. For example:
If the value  is Od. then the demand  should  be 919.5  m. gallons.
If the value  is 3d. then the demand  should  be 687.4  m. gallons.
If the value is 6d. then the demand  should  be 208.3  m. gallons.
Even at the very high value  of 6d. per gallon it would  appear  that the
livestock  industry  could profitably  absorb almost the total quantity  
presently  being returned  to farms. On the other hand if the price is 
3d. per gallon (perhaps  a more realistic  price in the light of present  
circumstances)  the effective  demand  should be almost three times the 
amount  available.
This exercise  in theoretical  demand  is furthermore  shown for each 
county with the result that if the value placed on skim milk is 3d. 
per gallon then the demand  from each province  would be as follows :
Munster  314.0  m. gallons
Leinster  198.4  m. gallons
Connaught  99.2 m. gallons
Ulster  77.5 m. gallons
125
It must be emphasised  that these are what are termed  desirable  levels  
of feeding  at a given value of 3d. f>er gallon. They are not by any 
means effective  levels of feeding  which would arise even if skim was 
available.  These figures compare  with actual availability  in the 1968 
milk season as indicated  already,  of Munster 150 million gallons, 
Leinster  and Connaught  3,2 million  gallons  each and Ulster 11 million 
gallons.
Prospects  for Skim
In giving any assessment  of the likely development  in skim one is 
automatically  entering  the realm of prophesy  because  forecasting  ahead  
the likely development  in the market  for skim milk products  is not easy 
in itself. Coupled  with this is the necessity  to forecast  the likely develop ­
ment in milk supply. This latter point in itself is not particularly  
difficult  if we are talking  about a relatively  short-term  projection  be­
cause it now seems certain  that milk supplies  in the 1970 milk season  
will be considerably  in excess of the 550 million  gallons  forecast  and 
may even exceed the 600 million gallons. On the other hand the 
recent statement  from the Minister  for Agriculture  on the future of 
the Irish Dairy Industry  suggested  that there may have to be some  
tapering  off in the rate of increase.  If total creamery  milk production  
increases  to a figure of approximately  600 million gallons  and if the 
value of skim return was to be maintained  then the total level available  
for on-farm  feed in 1970 would be in the region of 260 million  gallons. 
This is also on the assumption  that price levels for skim products  do 
not change  significantly  in the period and also on the assumption  that 
farmers  are prepared  to utilise this quantity  of skim milk.
The situation  with regard to international  markets  for skim products  
is much more complex  but it does seem likely that in the next two 
years the situation  will not have improved  significantly  but is equally 
not likely to have deteriorated  any further.  In this context  it must be 
mentioned  that there is every possiblity  that the Irish Dairy industry  
will become  involved  in the manufacture  of Casein  on a reasonably  large  
scale but it seems that it is likely to be at the expense  of skim milk 
which is currently  being made available  for skim milk powder.
Whey Supplies
The question  of the availability  of Whey for pig feeding  has within the 
past year aroused  a considerable  amount  of controversy  largely be­
cause of the intention  of most of the cheese manufacturers  to erect a 
factory  for the manufacture  of Lactose.  Such a factory  to be economic 
would require  about 40 million  gallons  of Whey per annum.  Estimates  
which have been prepared  by the manufacturers  suggest  that there is at 
least this quantity  of Whey available  or likely to be available  when the 
factory  is erected  over and above  the existing  requirements  of pig feeders. 
This quantity  would arise at the following  points:

3.0 million 
5.0 million
3.5 million 
3.0 million
4.5 million
4.5 million
6.6 million 
5.0 million
At an early stage in the discussions  on the establishment  of a Lactose  
factory  cheese manufacturers  met representatives  of the pig fattening  
co-operatives  and discussed  with them their requirements.  One of the 
difficulties  envisaged  was that although  the pig fattening  co-operatives  
and others could easily have absorbed  a considerable  amount  of this 
surplus  40 million  gallons  it was not clear at what price they would be 
prepared  to purchase  the Whey. Estimates  of the likely return to the 
cheese  factory  suggested  that a Lactose  factory  would yield about Id. 
per gallon and most of the pig fattening  co-operatives  would not have 
been prepared  to buy Whey ex-factory  at this price. In the present  
circumstances  without  a Lactose  factory  Whey is readily  available  and 
is being sold at a figure considerably  lower than this.
In 1967 it is estimated  that the total volume of milk utilised in 
cheese making  in Ireland  was in the region of 55 million  gallons.  This 
would suggest  that the total Whey resulting  from cheese making  was 
approximately  49 million  gallons.  In the figures  given already  in regard  
to the availability  of Whey for a Lactose  project 15 million  gallons  is 
in respect of factories  which are not, or were not in production  in 
1967. As a result the existing  factories  are indicating  an availability  
of 25 million  gallons.  It would seem, therefore,  that a further  24 million 
gallons of Whey from the already existing  factories  had been ear­
marked  for pig feeding.  Estimates  of milk usage for cheese  manufacture  
in 1970 suggest  that 65 million gallons  will be used and this would  
indicate  that the total amount  of Whey available  from this would be 
58.5 million  gallons.  On this basis it would seem that the amount  of 
Whey being made available  for feeding  after the erection  of a Lactose  
factory  in 1970 would only be slightly  smaller  at 18.5 million  gallons 
than the existing  figure of 24 million  gallons  which seems to have been 
utilised  in 1967. There is no definite  information  available  with regard  
to Whey usage in 1968 but it seems certain  that a substantial  amount  
of it was dumped  or disposed  of in some way other than pig feeding. 
This has probably  arisen largely from the fact that the skim milk 
powder  crisis made more skim milk available  but it also arose from the 
fact that many of the pig feeding  areas in the country  would find it 
too expensive  to transport  Whey from the existing  available  source.
127
In the light of current  difficulties  with regard to cheese making  it is 
unlikely  that total cheese  production  in 1970 and subsequent  years will 
require  very much more than the 65 million  gallons  already  indicated.  
As a result there seems little liklihood  of any great increase  in the 
total quantity  of Whey available  for feed unless the plans for the 
Lactose  factory  are not implemented.  There is one further source of 
Whey, however,  which may well arise in the near future and this 
concerns  the Whey resulting  from the manufacture  of Casein. Since  
any new Casein development  in this country is likely to be one 
involving  the use of hydrochloric  acid there is still some doubt as to 
whether  the resultant  Whey will be suitable  for feeding to animals  
without  further  treatment.
Summary
One of the major problems  with regard to the availability  of dairy by­
products  for animal  feed is that the greatest  proportion  of these dairy  
by-products  arise in the southern  half of the country whereas  the 
demand  exists in most parts of the country.  In particular  there seems to 
be a considerable  discrepency  between  available  supplies  in Leinster  
and the potential  demand  in that province.  This applies  equally  to the 
counties  of Cavan and Monaghan  where an extremely  high percentage 
of the total skim resulting  at the creameries  is utilised  in the manufacture  
of skim milk products.  On the other hand both of these counties  have 
a high incidence  of calf and pig feeding.  Whether  or not there is a long­
term future in the feeding  of milk substitutes  to farm animals  is not 
yet clear but in areas where a successful  industry  has been established  
and utilising  skim milk farmers  have made considerable  use of these  
products  and apparently  have suffered  no financial  disadvantage.  The 
important  factor however  is that they are able to dispose  of their skim 
milk at what would be termed “a good price”.
The future is particularly  difficult  to predict because  very much 
depends  on the price available  for skim milk products  and indeed  
whole milk both on international  markets,  on the structural  re­
organisation  which could occur in the industry  and on the value which  
farmers  place on the convenience  of having  their cans washed  at the 
creamery  premises  and returned  empty.

Introduction
The provision  of young cows is an important  component  of the dairy  
enterprise  not only in relation  to replacement  per se but also for ex­
pansion.  Presently  about 300,000  young  cows are entering  the national  
herd each year (Table 1) but the actual percentage  is dependant  upon

whether  the industry  is in a dynamic  or stationary  phase. In practice,  
rearing  heifers  can be viewed as a separate  enterprise  on a farm or a 
separate  farm system which supplies  replacers  to the market.  In this 
situation  where heifers  are reared in conjunction  with the dairy enter ­
prise (and this is, by far, the more common)  their contribution  to total 
gross margin per unit of land is usually unsatisfactory  by comparison  
with the major enterprise  on the farm. This comment  is prompted  by 
some experience  in examining  farm account  data. It must be recognised,  
however,  that the capital investment  per livestock  unit for milking  
facilities  together  with the labour  requirement  for this type of livestock 
are somewhat  less than for dairy cows.
Methodology
In this exercise  we are assuming  that a replacement  animal can be 
calved at 2 years of age in early March. The desirability  of early  
rather than later calving  can be illustrated  by the fact that once feed 
becomes  restrictive  towards  the end of the grazing  season milk yields 
irrespective  of stage of lactation  will be severely  affected.  Furthermore,  
it has been demonstrated  by Mr. Gleeson  at Moorepark  that the cost 
of boosting  yields by supplementary  meal feeding  towards  the latter end 
of the lactation  is about twice as expensive  as at the beginning.
Setting  the problem  in the context  of a farming  system will render  
the exercise  more meaningful  and it resolves  itself into one of buying  in 
young  Friesian  heifer calves in March  and selling  the surviving  animals  
as in-calf heifers 2 years later. This involves  synthesizing  and incor ­
porating  into the system  the various  components  involved  in the process  
and the costs of rearing  replacements  from birth to first calving.  As 
cattle prices are notorious  for their variability  it will be necessary  to 
take cognisance  of this factor.  Accordingly  three different  purchase  and 
sale price combinations  are used. For each stage of the process an 
attempt  is made to minimise  costs for a particular  addition  to output  
(i.e. weight).  In effect growth  should be accelerated  as far as possible 
when feed costs are cheap (e.g. summer).
The physical  data for this exercise  is derived from appropriate  
experiments  in both Moorepark  and Grange.  Although  it is difficult  to 
define  an “optimum ” for each stage from inter-experiment  comparisons,  
nevertheless  it is possible  to make recommendations  from these which 
are quite acceptable  in the sense that the response  anticipated  should 
be attainable  with a reasonable  degree of confidence.
Starting  then in March  by purchasing  young calves of about 90 lb. 
weight  we employed  the physical  and financial  data as set out hereunder.

Results
As mentioned  previously  the problem  is set in a farm system  context.  
Hence  we will estimate  output,  costs, and gross margins  for a 75 acre 
farm with one permanent  labour  unit. It is also assumed  that silage is 
made on contract  at a cost of 10/- pier ton. The distribution  of variable  
costs is given in Table 2.
Output,  variable  costs, and gross margins  per acre for each price 
combination  are given in Table 3 for the low level of calf mortality.

Comments
The gross margin per acre in Table 3 varies from £40 to £18 
depending  upon which price combination  is used. The former figure  
would  be achieved  with calves  purchased  at 1967 prices  and sold at 1969 
prices. Of course we must remember  that when calf prices are low 
heifer prices also tend to be low but the percentage  variation  for calves 
is usually  much greater  than for heifers.  However,  if we adopt a figure  
of £30 or so as being a reasonable  indicator  of the gross margin  from 
this enterprise  one might  expect  a gross margin  in the region  of £50 per 
acre for the dairy enterprise  with a comparable  level of efficiency.
In effect, then, it would cost a farmer  about £20 per acre for each 
acre he had devoted  to the replacement  enterprise,  or alternately  his total 
gross margin  would be reduced  by this amount  for each acre. Against 
this must be set the risk involved  in purchasing  in-calf  heifers  with its’ 
attendant  problem  of introducing  disease  into a dairy herd. However, 
when it is clearly  pointed  out to a farmer what it is costing  him to 
rear his own replacements,  it will make his decision-making  problem  
less difficult.

The Use of Dairy By-Products  
in Pig Feeding
by
T. J. Hanrahan  and J. F. O’Grady  
Pig Husbandry  Department,  An Foras Taluntais,  Moorepark.
The dairy by-products  available  to the pig industry  are skim milk,  
buttermilk  and whey. In terms of the nutrients  they supply,  these by­
products  may be treated  under two headings,  (A) protein  sources  (skim  
milk and buttermilk),  (B) energy  sources  (whey or all three depending  
on the level at which they are fed). The approximate  quantities  available  
nationally  for pig feeding  are as follows,  skim milk, 85 million gal.; 
buttermilk.  18 million  gal.; whey, 50 million  gal. (1). In terms of meal 
the combined  quantities  of skim milk and buttermilk  are equivalent  to 
57,500  tons of balanced  pig feed, while whey is equivalent  to a further  
16,750  tons of barley.
Production  of dairy products  is seasonal and consequently  the 
availability  of skim milk and whey varies from a situation  of too much 
at some stages of the year to too little at others. The over plentiful 
supply of these by-products  during the summer  months  lowers their 
economic  value to such an extent  that they are a much cheaper  source 
of pig feed than conventional  feedstuffs.  Pig farmers are therefore  
often faced with the problem  of forcing  the pig to drink larger  quantities  
of skim and whey than required  for efficient  utilization  or optimum  
production  by the pig.
Dairy by-products  can form a very valuable  portion  of the pigs diet 
provided  certain precautions  are taken both with regard to the feeding 
system  and general  hygiene.  Milk products  should  always  be introduced  
gradually  to the pigs diet, especially,  where pigs have been fed for a 
period on cereal based diets. This adaption  period is necessary  be­
cause the activity  of the enzyme  lactase,  responsible  for the degradation  
of lactose,  decreases  when pigs are weaned  from a milk based diet and 
consequently,  milk products  will be inefficiently  utilized  until such time 
as the activity  of this enzyme  increases.
Milk products  are an excellent  media for the growth of moulds, 
yeasts and bacteria.  When this is combined  with the high temperatures  
that exist in many piggeries,  then the importance  of hygiene  where 
dairy by-products  are fed becomes  very evident.  Failure to observe 
caution  with regard to either of these points is hazardous,  as it can 
onlv lead to poor nerformance  and increased  mortality  in pigs.
136
Skim Milk as a food for pigs
Skim milk (skim) is a very good source  of nutrients  for pigs. It can be 
fed to pigs of all ages but is particularly  useful for growing  pigs be­
cause of their high protein  requirement.
While skim is highly nutritious  an examination  of Table 1 shows 
that it is not a completely  balanced  feed for pigs. The total solids con­
tent is low and if given nothing  but skim, pigs daily nutrient  intake  would 
be marginal.  Skim is devoid of vitamins  A and D which are removed  
with the milk fat, but is a good source  of the water soluble  B vitamins.  
Calcium  and phosphorus  are present just in sufficient  quantities  to 
balance  the dry matter of skim, while minerals  such as iron, zinc, 
manganese  and copper  are present  in very minute  quantities.  The crude  
protein content of skim is high and is also very digestible.  This 
protein is high in lysine and other essential  amino acids thus making  
skim an excellent  protein  source  for pigs.
To get best utilization  of skim it must be fed in conjunction  with 
barley (or some other cereal) to which supplements  are added (Table  
2). Where properly  supplemented,  each gal. of skim can be equated  
to 1.25 lb. of a balanced  diet. In terms of its protein  content  each gal. 
is equivalent  to 0.5 lb. of fish meal or 0.75 lb. of soyabean  meal while  
the actual protein  has a higher biological  value.
Feeding  skim to growing-finishing  pigs
There are essentially  two situations  encountered  when feeding  skim to 
pigs, (1) The supply of skim is limited and it is used to supply the 
protein  portion  of the diet.
(2) The supply of skim is unlimited  and it is used to supply both 
protein  and energy  to the diet.
Situation  (1) results in the most efficient  utilization  of skim and is 
more desirable  nationally.
Skim, even in small quantities,  over-supplies  the protein  requirement  
of the pig while the energy requirement  is under-supplied.  This has 
led to the traditional  system of feeding  skim in limited quantities  to 
meet the protein requirement,  the energy being supplied  by a cereal.  
This system  allows  a maximum  of 6 pints of skim daily, the remainder  
of the diet eonsisting  of cereal.  Recent  research  (3) indicates  that there  
are advantages  to be obtained  from feeding  higher levels of skim as 
outlined  in Table 3. This higher level will result in leaner carcasses  
with eonsequent  improved  grading  provided  allowance  is made for the 
extra skim by reducing  the meal allowance  proportionally.  When feed­
ing skim in limited  quantities  it is best given at one feed as this ensures  
each pig getting  its quota.

When skim is plentiful  and competing  economically  with cereals  as 
a source  of energy,  a different  feeding  system  becomes  desirable.  In this 
situation  it is important  to have pigs consuming  the maximum  amount  
daily, without  unduly affecting  performance.  However,  at very high 
intake,  skim is not efficiently  utilized  and its replacement  value drops  
to 1.1 lb. of meal per gal. (4).
Skim has been fed as the sole source of feed for pigs (5) but this 
system is prone to digestive  upsets and consequently,  may be accom ­
panied  by poorer  performance.  Better  results  are obtained  where part of 
the diet consists  of meals as this restricts  skim intake and reduces  
the incidence  of digestive  upsets.  Therefore,  even where skim is plenti ­
ful, the best system to adopt is to feed 2 lb. of cereal per pig daily  
plus skim ad libitum. The cereal may be given at a single feed 
either in the morning  or evening  and to ensure  maximum  intake  of skim 
water should not be available.  The peak daily consumption  of skim 
using this feeding  system  would be 3 to 3.5 gal. per pig.
There is very little difference  between  the two systems  outlined  for 
feeding skim, in terms of pig performance.  The system to choose  
depends  entirely  on the relative  costs of skim and other feeds. Table  
4 shows the results  of an experiment  comparing  both systems.

Effect of feeding  skim on carcass  quality
Theoretically,  diets containing  a high proportion  of skim should  
produce  leaner carcasses  because  of the high protein  intake,  which is 
also high in lysine. If however,  allowance  is not made for the energy 
content  then fatter carcasses  may result on feeding  skim, simply  due 
to increased  energy  intake. For each extra pint of skim fed, the meal 
allowance  should be reduced  by 2.5 oz. If this is done, then increasing  
the skim content  of the diet will result in leaner carcasses  (3). Where  
skim is being fed in limited quantities  care must be taken to ensure  
that all pigs get their quota, otherwise  pigs may become  overfat  due to 
insufficient  protein  intake.
139
Feeding  skim milk to sows
With regard to the gestating  sow, the present  practice  is to feed her 
4.5 lb. of a balanced  diet daily. The same nutrients  can also be pro­
vided by 1 gal. of skim plus 3.4 lb. of a cereal,  supplemented  as shown 
in Table 2. Where skim is readily available  larger quantities  may be 
fed. Four gallons  of skim would supply  the protein  and energy  needs of 
the sow but certain  minerals  and vitamins  would be deficient.  There is 
also the possibility  of digestive  upsets on a complete  milk diet. There ­
fore, part of a gestating  sow’s diet should consist  of cereal (1 to 2 lb. 
daily).
In the case of lactating  sows (rearing  9 piglets)  an average  daily feed 
intake is 13 lb. of a balanced  diet. If skim were used to supply the 
protein  requirement,  the daily feed allowance  would be 3 gal. of skim 
plus 10 lb. of cereal. Larger  quantities  of skim could be fed to meet  
some of the energy  requirement,  but for the lactating  sow the energy  
requirement  is high and cannot  be met entirely  by skim. The maximum  
daily intake  of liquid by a sow is in the region  of 6 gal., which  in terms  
of skim represents  7.5 lb. of a balanced  diet. Where skim is plentiful  
the lactating  sow should get a minimum  of 7 lb. of cereal daily, plus 
skim ad libitum.
A problem  often encountered  when feeding  skim to lactating  sows is 
that young  piglets  may also drink from the sows trough.  This need not 
be a problem  if troughs  and the area around them are kept clean 
and skim may, in fact, form part of the suckling  pigs diet. If hygiene  
is poor then mould and bacterial  growths  may develop  which if in­
gested  could cause digestive  upsets.
Should  skim be fed sour or sweet?
Feeding  skim in either the sour or sweet state does not seem to have 
any significant  effect on pig performance.  However,  it is important  to 
feed consistently  in one or other state. If skim of variable  sourness  is 
fed, then digestive  upsets develop.  For very young pigs sweet skim is 
more desirable  because  of its palatability.
If skim is being fed sour, then a two-day  period should be allowed  
between  separation  and feeding  for souring  to be completed.  Where  
skim is being fed sweet, it should  be used on the day it is separated.  If 
this is not possible,  skim can be prevented  from souring  by the addition  
of 0.15 per cent, formalin  (1.5 Ib./lOO gal. milk). Under normal  
conditions,  treated skim will remain sweet for approximately  8 days. 
(6 days during very warm weather).  Formalin  treated skim may be 
slightly  less palatible  than untreated  skim but it has the advantage  that 
it can be fed through  drinking  bowls and nipples.
140
Economics  of feeding  skim
Skim may replace  the protein  or both the protein  and energy  fractions  
of the pigs diet depending  on the quantity  fed. Consequently  its econo ­
mic value depends  on the quantity  fed.
Where  quantities  of not greater  than 1 gal. of skim are fed daily then 
this gal. may be equated  to 0.43 lb. of soyabean  meal plus 0.82 lb. of 
barley. At current  prices for these ingredients  this represents  a value  
of 5d. per gal. Where  intake  is greater  than 1 gal. per day, skim replaces  
barley  in the diet and is worth approximately  3.7d. per gal.
These calculations  give an indication  of the economic  value of skim. 
They do not however  take into account  the higher biological  value of 
skim protein,  neither  do they account  for the cost involved  in transport,  
handling  and maintaining  hygiene  where  skim is fed.
Buttermilk  as a food for pigs
Buttermilk  has practically  the same composition  (Table  5) as skim and 
may be treated  as such when being fed to pigs. Economically  it has the 
same value as skim.

Whey  as a food for pigs
Whey may be used successfully  as a feed for pigs provided  its 
deficiencies  are recognised  and supplemented  adequately.  It gives best 
performance  when fed in limited  quantities  and can form part of the 
diet for pigs of all ages.
The composition  of whey shown in Table 6 reveals some of the 
deficiencies.  Total solids  content  is very low and pigs could not possibly
141
consume  enough  whey daily, to meet their nutrient  requirements.  Ap­
proximately  75 per cent, of the whey dry matter consists  of lactose, 
consequently,  whey must be introduced  gradually  to the diet of mature  
pigs that have been fed for a period on cereal based diets. The crude  
protein  content  of whey is low but the amount  present  is very diges ­
tible. Whey is a good source of B vitamins  but does not contain  
vitamins  A or D. Calcium  and phosphorus  are present  in a concentra ­
tion sufficient  to meet the pigs requirements  but insufficient  to make  
whey a source  of these minerals.  Iron, zinc, manganese  and copper  are 
present  in trace amounts  and may in cases be deficient.  The concentra ­
tion of soluble chloride  salts varies with the manufacturing  process 
but should not be a problem  even where large quantities  of whey are 
fed.
While the total solids content of whey is low, if it is properly  
supplemented,  each gal. of whey may be equated  to 0.75 lb. of barley.

Feeding  whey to growing-finishing  pigs
Whey can be fed in varying  amounts  to pigs but best results  in terms  
of whey utilization  are obtained  when it is fed in limited quantities.  
Where  limited  feeding  is practiced,  whey is gradually  introduced  to the 
pigs diet (each gallon replacing  0.75 lb. of barley),  to a maximum  of 
2 gal. daily at 100 Ib. liveweight.  At this stage the whey allowance  is 
fixed and thereafter  the meal allowance  is increased.  Daily meal and
142
whey allowances  per pig for this feeding  system are given in Table 7 
and the composition  of the meal (whey supplement)  is given in Table  
8. This feeding  system gives very good results in terms of daily gain 
and feed efficiency  as shown in Table 9.

In situations  where whey is plentiful,  quantities  greater than two 
gallons  may be fed. The system of feeding  in such a situation  is one 
that ensures  high intakes  of whey and at the same time does not unduly
143
reduce  pig performance.  The amount  of whey consumed  by pigs can be 
increased  by reducing  the quantity  of meal fed (Table 10). However,  as 
the quantity  of meal fed decreases  the performance  of pigs decreases  
such that even where large quantities  of whey are available,  it is not 
practical  to feed less than 2.5 lb. of meal per pig daily. If whey is fed 
ad libitum  with this allowance  of meal, pigs will consume  4 to 5 gal. 
daily in the final stages  of fattening.  Daily  liveweight  gain will be reduced  
somewhat,  as compared  to an all meal diet, such that days to slaughter  
(50 to 200 lb. liveweight)  will be increased  by approximately  15 days (7).

Feeding  whey to sows
Whey may be included  as part of the diet for gestating  sows. However,  
it is not possible  to feed these sows entirely  on whey, as nutrient  intake 
would be insufficient.  The system  of feeding  should  include  a minimum  
of meal equivalent  against a requirement  of approximately  13 lb. A 
meal are fed, then whey should be restricted  and fed on the basis of 
one gal. being equivalent  to 0.75 lb. of barley. The whey supplement  
outlined  on Table 8 may be used for gestating  sows.
With regard to lactating  sows, whey can form only a small part of 
the total diet. A sow consuming  6 gal. per day would be getting  4.5 lb. 
of meal equivalent  against  a requirement  o fapproximately  13 lb. A 
suitable  feeding  system  for lactating  sows is, 9 lb. of meal (Table 8) 
daily plus whey ad libitum.
Storage  of whey
Untreated  whey cannot  be stored for long periods  and yet maintain  its 
feeding  value. After 2 to 3 days in storage,  yeast, mould and bacteria  
counts increase  and cause deterioration  by converting  lactose  to lactic 
acid. Formalin  added at the rate of 1.5 lb. per 100 gal. slows this
144
deterioration  somewhat,  but even then storage  beyond 3 to 4 days is 
not recommended.
Due to the seasonality  of whey there has been quite a lot of interest  
recently  in storing  whey during  the summer  months  for feeding  during  
the autumn  and winter months.  Two approaches  to the problem  have  
been studied  at Moorepark  and are summarized  as follows:
1. Lagoon  storage  of whey —this is a simple and cheap method  for 
storing  whey but is very inefficient  in the preservation  of nutrients.  
Moorepark  results  suggest  that after 10 days storage  whey has lost 
at least 50 per cent, of its feeding  value. (8)
2. Lagoon  storage of condensed  whey —with this method whey is 
first concentrated  to 20 per cent, total solids and then stored in a 
lagoon. Whey maintains  its chemical  composition  for up to 3 
months  under this system  of storage.  (9)
Economics  of feeding  whey
Whey substitutes  for the cereal portion of the pigs diet, hence its 
economic  value may be compared  to that of barley.  One gal. of whey 
supplies  the same nutrients  as 0.75 lb. of barley and this substitution  
rate holds even where large quantities  of whey are fed. In situations  
where whey intake is limited  (2 gal./day  and less), the substitution  rate 
may be higher. Therefore,  costing barley at £31 per ton, whey is 
worth approximately  2d. per gal. In practice  however,  whey is not 
worth this price for a number  of reasons.
Transportation  of whey is costly, as is the handling  of whey on the 
farm, where it increases  the labour  requirement  of feeding.  Glazed  tile 
troughs are essential  since whey is corrosive  and pen floors also 
deteriorate  faster where whey feeding is practiced.  The overall per­
formance  of pigs decreases  when large quantities  of whey are fed and 
the incidence  of digestive  upsets increases.  Considering  all these points,  
it is difficult  to put a single price on the value of whey. It depends  
on: haulage  distance,  feeding  system,  quantity  fed and most important,  
the price of other feeds.

Problems  of Animal Health  
in Relation  to Intensive  Grassland

It is well known  that there are a variety  of diseases  and disorders  which  
are confined  to grazing  animals,  and the occurrence  of which is related  
to the pasture.  As the system of grazing  changes  from an extensive 
range-type  pasture to an intensive  production  enterprise,  there is a 
concurrent  change  in the disease  pattern.  Obviously  there are problems  
of management  in intensive  grassland,  and one has to appreciate  at 
least some of these in order to understand  many of the diseases  which  
assume  increased  importance.  From the point of view of this paper,  
probably  the most relevant  problem  is the maintenance  of a food 
supply  with something  approaching  a constant  nutritional  value.
By now, I imagine,  all are familiar  with the pattern of seasonal 
variation  of quality in a grass pasture.  During  the early part of the 
year the grass is growing  quickly,  in the leafy stage, and supplies  a 
highly digestible  product,  rich in soluble carbohydrates  and protein. 
However,  by the latter part of July the feeding  value of the grass 
falls off and, almost in spite of any variation  in management,  from 
there on through  the autumn  it is a product  of moderate  value. The 
addition  of clover to this pasture  will alter the pattern  considerably,  
giving a food in July and August  of a higher value to the ruminant  
than grass of the same period.  It is not for me to discuss  the problems  
of managing  a grass/clover  sward,  nor to theorise  on the possibility  of 
grass supplies  for the early season and of clover for later on, but it 
is my purpose  to look at some of the health implications  of these 
nutritional  changes.  For instance,  a few years ago we undertook  an 
experiment  on a cobalt-deficient  pasture  and compared  the growth  rates  
of two groups  of lambs of varying  age (1). The first group were born 
in mid February  and were slaughtered  in June; the response  to cobalt  
was about 4 lbs. per lamb. The second  group were born early in April  
and were run on the same pasture;  by mid July there was a clear  
effect in favour  of cobalt in this group,  and within the next few weeks  
many of the undosed  lambs were losing weight,  whereas  the cobalt-  
supplemented  lambs continued  to thrive satisfactorily.  By the end of 
August  there was a difference  of 17 lbs. between  the average  weights  
of the treated  and control  lambs in this group.
146
This diiTerence  in performance  may have been caused by one or 
more of several  factors— but important  amongst  these, 1 am sure, was 
the quality  of the herbage.  Cobalt  deficiency,  in the degree which we 
commonly  see it, affects the value of the food to the ruminant  a re­
duction  in the quality  of a pasture  as measured  in the laboratory  will 
affect the cobalt deficient  lamb much more seriously  than the lamb  
which has an adequate  supply  of cobalt.  In addition  the length of time 
that the lambs were exposed  to the low cobalt diet would be impor ­
tant; as the rate of gain for cobalt supplemented  lambs was a 1 lb. per 
day in the first experiment  and a 3 lb. per day in the second  experi ­
ment, it is obvious  that the control  lambs had much longer (in fact 45 
days longer)  to become  seriously  depleted.
Another  pasture  factor which varies considerably  during  the grazing  
season is the mineral  content  of the sward. We now know quite a lot 
about the way in which stage of growth and the time of the year 
affects the chemical  constituents  of the pasture  species  (2). We would  
like to know more than we do of the -easons  behind  these changes  and 
how we might influence  them. G-ass tetany,  affecting  the lactating  cow 
or ewe in the early spring,  has been the topic of much discussion  and 
a great deal of work. Clearly,  there are several reasons  for the high 
ocurrence  of this disorder  in March and ^pril, but foremost  amongst  
these is the low content  of magnesium  in the, grass at that time of 
vear (3).
Much has been said about the part played by clover,  which is rich 
in magnesium,  in the prevention  of grass tetany;  but in fact even in an 
all-grals  sward the magnesium  content  rises so clearly as the season 
progresses  that the risk of grass tetany will not persist.  1 feel therefore,  
that probably  the most important  factor in the incidence  of grass  
tetany is the production  and use of early grass. The part played by 
fertiliser  applications  is closely linked with this, it is obvious  that 
nitrogen  applications  are necessary  for early grass; they cause some 
increase  in the nitrogen  content  of the herbage,  but one is faced with 
the alternative  of using nitrogen  and having  a high protein product  or 
not using nitrogen  and having  virtually  no grass. Potassic  fertilisers  are 
rather different,  the use of them in the late winter leads to a rapid  
uptake  of potassium  by the grass, which undoubtedly  increases  the risk 
of hypomagnesaemia.  The use of potassic  fertilisers  during the late 
summer  and autumn  avoids this effect to a considerable  extent. In 
passing,  it may be worth commenting  on the excessive  use of potassic  
fertilisers  on occasional  farms —I know  of several  farms  where  the advice 
had to be given that no potassic  fertiliser  applications  for pasture  were 
needed  for a few years. In this connection,  advertising  pressure  to use 
compound  fertilisers  may suggest  to the farmer  that N, P, and K are 
always  required  together.  For pasture,  I can’t see the value of potassic 
fertiliser  in combination  with nitrogen.
147
Returning  to grass tetany, obviously  there is no alternative  if we 
want to utilise  early grass for milk production  (and of course  we do)— 
extra magnesium  will have to be supplied.  Now if the supply  of grass 
is inadequate  for maintenance  and production  requirements,  additional  
food may be desirable,  and the magnesium,  as calcined  magnesite,  can 
be combined  with this. If, however,  there is adequate  grass and the 
cereal rations are given purely as a conveyor  of magnesium,  then I 
think other means  are preferable  and there are two practical  possibilities. 
For the farmer  who wants to be really sure, pasture  dusting  gives a 
good degree  of safety.  Calcined  magnesite  is applied,  either by hand or 
using a spinner-type  fertiliser  spreader,  at the rate of 28 lb. per acre (4). 
The use of molasses-magnesite  mix in tubs gives a useful means of 
supplying  magnesium,  especially  where the size of the area involved 
makes pasture  dusting  uneconomical.  It has the disadvantage  that one 
has to rely on the voluntary  co-operation  of each cow to ensure its 
success,  but experience  has shown that sufficient  cows do co-operate.  
Of course one also gets the over-keen  cow—the individual  who feels 
it necessary  to eat her neighbour ’s portion  as well as her own, and the 
results  are obvious  but not serious.
It was interesting  to compare  the blood levels of cows on dusted  
pasture  with those supplied  with M.M. mix tubs on a very similar  
pasture (5). Although  the average blood magnesium  levels for each 
group were very similar— 2.1 mg% for dusted pasture  (21 cows) com­
pared with 2.3 mg% (23 cows), the variation  between  individuals  
within the groups  was quite different —the cows on the dusted pasture  
varying  by +/— .2 mg% whereas,  those having  free access to the tubs 
varied by +/— .5 mg%. In dusted pasture no samples  fell below  
1.7 mg%, whereas,  in the free access group 2 cows had magnesium  
values as low as 1.1 and 1.2 mg%. Obviously  the chances  of a failure  
in the latter group  was far greater.
Of course  part and parcel  with the intensive  grassland  is the extended  
grazing  season— with improved  drainage,  improved  soil fertility  and the 
possibility  of spelling  the pastures  by controlled  grazing,  it is possible 
in most areas to extend the grazing  season at both ends. In addition,  
most intensive  systems  provide  for hay or silage to be taken as part of 
the system,  so that animals  will be, in effect, living in a largely self- 
contained  nutritional  environment.  In many cases the only input is in 
the form of fertilisers  (N, P and K) and lime. Even farm-yard  manure,  
in that it is usually  produced  within the system,  only returns  some of 
the nutrients  but cannot be looked on as a supply  for new ones. The 
farmer  relies on the soil as a supply  source  for a variety  of major and 
minor elements  and is fortunately  seldom  disappointed.  Unfortunately,  
lime, which is a necessary  soil conditioner  and controls  the uptake  of 
certain  elements  which are toxic to plants,  also controls  the uptake  of
148
essential  or undesirable  elements  for animal nutrition  with, at times,  
unfortunate  consequences.  Whether,  in the long term, we are creating  
problems  as yet undetermined,  is not within the ambit of this paper  
but there are some conditions  which are becoming  too well known  for 
comfort  and which  do spring  into prominence  in systems  such as I have 
described.
In East Galway  and Roscommon  for example,  the light texture  lime­
stone soils, when developed  in this way to a state of relatively  high 
production,  do not contain  sufficient  cobalt to maintain  the health of 
rapidly  growing  lambs. Ewes, probably  from the combination  of age, 
low productivity  and the availability  of selective  grazing  for parts of 
the year (for example  between  weaning  and flushing)  do not show 
any ill effects.
Copper  deficiency  is another  condition  often associated  with an in­
tensive  system,  particularly  one which involves  calves or young cattle.  
In Ireland  copper  deficiency  in cattle and cobalt  deficiency  in sheep  can 
be looked  on as our two most common  animal  trace element  deficiencies. 
In the case of copper  it is not a shortage  of supply,  but the inability  of 
the animal  to make full use of the supplies  which are available.  Many  
of the soils in North Leinster (limestone  drift soils), and many  
of the cut-over  bogs, as well as the marine  alluvial  soils, contain  high 
levels of molybdenum.  The availability  of this molybdenum  for herbage  
varies considerably  depending  on the soil, but it is increased  as the 
soil pH rises. Thus the application  of lime, particularly  as large dress ­
ings, can release the element  and result in a very high molybdenum  
content in the herbage.  In spite of normal amounts  of copper,  the 
cattle are unable  to maintain  the level necessary  for health.  The exact  
reasons for this are not fully understood  but it appears that the 
absorption  of copper  in the intestine  is interfered  with.
This is a good example  of a disorder  which,  with the change  to in­
tensive  systems,  will become  much more important.  As the reduction  in 
copper  can be quite slow, the effects of the extra few weeks of the 
grazing  season can be quite significant.  The newborn  calf is usually  
supplied  with very high reserves  of liver copper,  but in the case of 
calves born in a high molybdenum  area, this reserve  can be reduced  
(6). Obviously  this calf will be less capable  of contending  with the 
molybdenum  excess as a weanling  than a calf bought  in from another  
area.
The effects  of this on cattle production  can be seen in some of our 
experiments  (7). For instance,  with single-suckled  calves,  copper  treated  
groups  can have an average  weight in October,  100 lb. greater  than 
the untreated  control animals. Perhaps more important  than the 
actual weight increment  is the uniformity  and healthy  appearance  of 
the cattle in the copper  treated groups,  compared  with those that did 
not receive  copper.
149
In a recent trial using Friesian  bullocks,  the effect on liveweight  was 
again seen, although  after a dry summer  it was only noticeable  in 
September  and October,  when the copper  treated  cattle put on up to 
60 lb. more (8).
There is obviously  considerable  variation  from one year to another,  
depending  on the weather.
It is also apparent  from our work that stock given a good supply 
of highly nutritious  fodder will show the ill-effects  of induced  copper  
deficiency  much more rap dly and more obviously  than those kept in 
poor condition.
Since clover contains  very much more molybdenum  than grass, and 
since nitrogen  appears  to reduce the uptake  of molybdenum  by grass, 
an all grass-high  nitrogen sward might be worth consideration.  I 
mention  this here to illustrate  how much pasture  management  and the 
type of stock can influence  a condition  which might at first glance 
appear  to be a simple  matter  of the shortage  of a trace mineral.
Some intensive  systems  involve  animals  experiencing  enforced  under ­
nutrition  for periods  of the year when high production  is not expected.  
The advisability  of such procedures  is questionable  and 1 feel that in 
most cases the saving  in costs is largely  offset by the stress suffered  by 
the animal and the resulting  effects on health. The autumn  nutrition  
of the single-SLickler  cow is an example,  when a pregnant  or early  
lactating  cow is expected  to survive  on the remains  of the last season ’s 
grass and the hope of silage later on. Winter  tetany,  a disorder  closely  
akin to grass tetany in which low blood magnesium  is usually seen 
together  with reduced  calcium,  is known  to occur under these circums ­
tances.  Although  one would expect calcined  magnesite  to prevent  this 
condition,  its success  is only moderate  unless the standard  of nutrition  
is improved —in fact the use of magnesite  is generally  not required  when  
such cows are reasonably  well fed. It may well be that much of the 
infertility  seen in our dairy herds is the after-effect  of a very moderate  
winter  nutrition,  since it is known  that the nutrition  of a pregnant  cow 
has a subsequent  effect on her reproductive  performance  (9).
I have not mentioned  the role of intestinal  parasites  in animal ill- 
health, these are largely outside my own field. However,  many of 
the considerations  regarding  nutrition  and the length of the grazing 
season  etc., which I have tried to relate to the mineral  nutrition  of the 
grazing  animal,  will also be relevant  to the presence  and effects of 
gastro-intestinal  parasites.  In addition  one can get interaction  effects,  
for example,  in cobalt  deficient  lambs the ill effects  of moderate  worm  
burdens  can be much more severe  than in cobalt  sufficient  animals  (10).
In summary,  highly productive  pastures  will require  efficient  and well 
managed  stock to utilise them profitably,  giving reasonable  financial  
returns.  This high level of production  by the individual  animal  involves  
considerable  stress and shows up any weaknesses  that may be present. 
There may be need to consider  furtiicr  the development  of stock suit­
able for such intensive  grassland.

Modern  Methods  of Swede  
Production  and Traditional  Methods  
of Swede Utilization
by
T. F. Leonard
The Agricultural  Institute,  Oukpark
Introduction
Although  the area under swedes fell from nearly 200,000  acres to 
slightly  less than 100,000  acres during  the period 1930-1960,  it is still 
the most popular  root crop in this country.  Shortage  of labour is the 
main cause for this reduction  in acreage.  However,  modern  cultural  
techniques  are gradually  reducing  the amount  of hand labour needed 
and the acreage  being grown  is rising again.
The practice  of growing  swedes  for in situ grazing  by sheep is very 
old in Ireland  and the present-day  increase  in the area grown is mainly 
for this purpose,  particularly  for hoggets.
The object of the present  project  at Oak Park is to obtain informa ­
tion on the production  of the maximum  amount  of utilizable  swede  
food per acre, at the minimum  cost per ton. In order to get this in­
formation  the following  trials were laid down in 1965;
(a) Variety  trials
(b) Spacing  trials
(c) Herbicide  trials
In order to find out if a particular  variety  was acceptable  and if such 
a variety  had any detrimental  effect on the teeth when eaten, all the 
above trials were grazed in situ by hoggets.  The average  live weight 
gain of the 240 hoggets  used to graze these trials was 12 Ib./head  in a 
period of 12 weeks.
As the investigations  proceeded  the results being obtained  and the 
many queries coming in from outside dictated  that additional  trials  
both from a cultural  and a utilization  viewpoint  were necessary.  There ­
fore in 1966 “a time of spraying  with paraquat”  trial was added. In 
the spacing  trial an “on the drill” treatment  was included  and the 
yield and percentage  utilization  was compared  with the “on the 
flat” treatments.  An N, P, K, spacing  factorial  trial was laid down in 
1966, 1967 and 1968 to find out if it was necessary  to vary the pro­
portions  of N, P and K as the plant populations  changed.
In 1967 and ’68 special areas of green top turnips,  hard and soft 
swedes and marrow  stem kale were grown and grazed separately  by 
different  breeds  of hoggets.  A long-term  experiment  to find the effect on
153
sheep ’s teeth when grazed on hard (Bangholm)  and soft (Broadland)  
swedes  and marrow  stem kale were grown and grazed separately  by 
sowing ” trial was added in 1968.
The varieties  selected  for these trials were the ones that had consis ­
tently given high yields of dry matter per acre over a wide range of 
soils for a number  of years, in the trials conducted  by the Plant Breed ­
ing Department  of An Foras Taluntais.  These varieties  were Broadland,  
Bangholm  and Wilhelmsburger.  Tipperary,  being a very popular  variety  
was included  from the start and later a few other varieties  were added.
METHOD  AND MATERIALS
(A) 1965 Trials
In 1965 all the cultural  trials were laid down in 4 randomised  blocks.  
All the trials were sown with the precision  seeder  to a pre determined  
stand and there was chemical  weed control.  After estimating  the yield  
per acre the entire area was strip grazed across the treatments  with 
mixed breeds  of hoggets.  When the swedes  were grazed  off as uniformly  
as possible  the amount  uneaten  was estimated  by lifting the uneaten  
portion  at 4 randomised  points in each treatment,  in the variety and 
spacing  trials.

Age of stale seedbed  trial
The object of this trial was to ascertain  the most suitable  time interval  
between  preparation  of the seedbed  and sowing of the seeds, using 
the stale seedbed  technique.  The seedbed  was finally prepared  on May
157
2. 3\ pints Paraquat  in 50 gal. water per acre was applied at three  
2-week intervals  to randomised  plots. For the first two applications,  
the paraquat  was applied  immediately  after sowing;  for the latter two 
applications  the plots were sprayed  first and the seeds precision  spaced  
about 1 hour afterwards.  The herbicide  burned  off all the green herbage  
in all the treatments.  In the “end of June treatment ”, although  the 
leaves and stems of the knotgrass  and red shank plants disappeared  
the plants were not killed. They produced  new leaves and stems and 
completely  colonised  the plots, particularly  the knotgrass.  Some knot ­
grass plants grew to a size of 12 feet in diameter.  There v/as no crop 
obtained  from this last treatment.

Herbicides  on Fresh and Stale seedbeds  V Cultivations
This experiment  consisted  of 15 treatments  and was laid down in six 
randomised  blocks.  Each treatment  was 70 yds. long and consisted  of 
4 rows, 18 in. apart.
In the post emergence  application  of the nitrophene  plots, the swede  
plants became  badly twisted  and distorted,  but as soon as new leaves  
developed  the crop recovered.

Bullocks  V. Hoggets  swede  Utilization  Trial
In November  1967 a trial was laid down to find out if 2 year old 
bullocks  would utilize  swedes  by in situ grazing  as efficiently  as hoggets.  
Forty 2-year old bullocks  (with 2 permanent  incisors)  were randomly  
drawn into 4 groups of 10 each. Forty Galway  wether hoggets  were 
drawn into two random  groups and forty Suffolk  X wether hoggets 
were drawn  into two random  groups  and the following  treatments  were  
arranged.
A. 10 Friesian  x bullocks  in situ grazing  Bangholm  swedes 10.6%
D.M.
B. 10 Friesian  x bullocks  in situ grazing  Bangholm  swedes 10.6%
D.M. + 4 lb. meal daily/head.
C. 10 Friesian  x bullocks  on self feed silage only.
D. 10 Friesian  x bullocks  on self feed silage only + 4 lb. meal daily/  
head.
E. 20 Galway  hoggets  in situ grazing  Bangholm  swedes 10.6% D.M.
F. 20 Galway  hoggets  in situ grazing  Bangholm  swedes 10.6% D.M. 
+ 1 lb. meal daily/head.
G. 20 Suffolk  X hoggets  in situ grazing  Bangholm  swedes  11% D.M.
H. 20 Suffolk  X hoggets  in situ grazing  Bangholm  Swedes  10.9% D.M. 
+ 1 lb. meal daily/head.
All bullocks  were fed 7 lb. barley straw daily per head and the 
meal mixutre  consisted  of equal parts of rolled barley and dried beet 
pulp. The original  intention  was to keep the bullocks  on the in situ 
grazing  for 12 weeks,  but they cut up the ground  very badly,  trampling  
and soiling  the swedes.  It was therefore  decided  to house the bullocks  
and feed them pulped  swedes  for the remaining  6 weeks.

(D) 1968 Trials
The following  cultural  trials were laid down in 1968:
(a) Variety  trial, consisting  of 8 varieties.
(b) Time of sowing  trial, consisting  of 7 different  sowing  dates.
(c) Age of stale seed bed, having  5 different  soil preparation  dates.
(d) Deep v. shallow  sowing  on stale seedbed.
(e) Herbicide  trial, consisting  of 10 different  treatments.
(f) N.P.K.  spacing  factorial  trial, identical  with the 1967 trial.
(g) Spacing  trial, having 12 different  treatments.
(h) Time of spraying  with nitrophene  trial, having 12 different  treat ­
ments.
All the returns  to date for this year ’s trials are provisional  because  it 
has not been possible  to have the figures  statistically  analysed.

Time of Sowing  Trial
This trial was laid down in 5 randomised  blocks.  The seeds were sown  
2 in. apart in 18 in. rows and there were 4 rows in each treatment.  
At the 3-4 leaf stage the crop was singled  to 8 in. apart by hand. Weeds  
were controlled  manually.  The yield was obtained  by harvesting  45.4 
feet of the middle  two drills in each treatment.

Observations  on this trial
There  were very severe  attacks  of aphids  on the treatments  sown on the 
first three sowing dates. Any infection  or attacks on the last four 
treatments  came from the first three sowings.
A large sack of bulbs of each of the treatments  was stored away 
immediately  after harvesting,  and storage  investigations  have been made  
on them.
Age of Stale Seedbed  Trial
In the “Age of Seedbed ” trial laid down in 1966, the seedbeds  for all 
the treatments  were prepared  on the same date, and the dates of sowing  
and spraying  varied. In this trial the dates of preparing  the seedbeds 
varied  and all treatments  were sown and sprayed  on the same day. This 
eliminated  the risk of different  sowing  dates affecting  the yield.
There were 5 dates of seedbed  preparation  and 2 rates of paraquat  
application.  The treatments  were as follows :

Deep Sowing  v. Shallow  Sowing  on a Stale Seedbed
Very often when seeds are sown on a 6-7 weeks old seed bed, many  
of the seeds are badly covered  or not covered  at all. Frequently,  the 
soil that is dragged  (by the drag chain of the seeder)  into the groove  
containing  the seeds is just hard dry crumbs  of soil. In the case of the 
Stan-Hay  seeder, the rear pressing  wheel is too wide to fit into this 
groove and under the dry hard soil conditions  associated  with stale 
seedbeds,  the rear wheel rides on the hard shoulders  of this groove. 
Under such conditions  the rear wheels play no part in breaking  the 
little hard lumps of soil, which would help to cover the seeds.
It was hoped to get over this difficulty  by fitting a f” x V belt 
to the middle  of the rear wheels.  The V belt would fit into the grooves  
and should help to break the lumps and press the soil down on the 
seeds. With this object in view the following  trial was laid down.
A. Shallow  with normal  wheel, deep. Notch 5.
B. Shallow  with V belt fitted, deep. Notch 5.
C. Deep  with normal  wheel, Ij” deep. Notch  7.
D. Deep with V belt fitted, l^” deep. Notch  7.

Spacing  Trial
This trial consisted  of 12 treatments  and was laid down in 5 randomised  
blocks. Each treatment  had 4 rows and was 30 yds. in length. All 
treatments  were on the flat. The seeds were sown with the precision  
seeder 1 in. apart and thinned  by hand to the required  spacings  at the 
3-4 true leaf stage.
The yield was obtained  by harvesting  1 random  drill from the middle  
two drills in each treatment.  The bulbs and tops were weighed  separately.  
There was an effort made to find out what weight of the bulbs was 
overground  by cutting  the bulbs across at ground  level. After the crop 
was reasonably  well grazed the uneaten portions  in the remaining  
middle  drill were lifted and weighed.

Time of spraying  with Nitrophene
It is well known that when nitrophene  is applied  post-emergence  to 
swede plants that severe distortion  of the leaves takes place. The 
reduction  in yield (if any) caused by this distortion  is not definitely 
known and there are various opinions  on the subject. Tyson and 
Bartlett  (1) claimed  that the post-emergence  application  of 3^ pints  
of nitrophene  per acre at any stage of crop growth  from emergence  to 
the 3-4 true leaf stage does not cause any reduction  in yield. However,  
in 1966 trials, the yield per acre from post-emergence  application  of 
nitrophene  was 4.5 tons less than from pre-emergence  application,  
although  in the visual assessment  of weed control  the post-emergence
169
application  was placed third and the pre-emergence  application  was 
placed fourth. In the estimation  of weeds present  at harvesting  time 
there were practically  3,000 more weeds present  per acre in the pre­
emergence  treatments.  Also there was over 2000 more bulbs per acre 
in the pre-emergence  application  treatments.  Further  the recommenda ­
tions on the leaflets being distributed  with nitrophene  are changing. 
Some  years ago, application  at the 3 rough  leaf stage was recommended;  
in 1968 it was recommended  to apply the herbicide  when the first true 
leaf was J” across.
In view of these diverse  findings  it was decided  to design  a trial that 
might measure  the effect of this distortion  on yield. The following 
treatments  were laid down in 5 randomised  blocks.  All treatments  were  
sown on May 27.
A. Soil prepared  May 21, herbicide  applied  June 8, Cotyledon  fully
expanded.
B. Soil prepared  May 21, herbicide  applied  June 12, 1st true leaf

The object of changing  the date of seedbed  preparation  was to have 
a larger number  of weeds emerge  at the optimum  time for herbicide  
application.  Unfortunately  there were large numbers  of Shepherds  
purse. Groundsel,  Chickweed,  Fumitory,  Sow thistle. Wild pansy.  
Speedwell,  Deadnettle  and some Charlock.  The herbicide  did not con­
trol these weeds in any of the treatments,  and many Lambs quarter  
plants were not controlled.  In all the treatments,  the plants became  
disotrted.  In mid July when the weeds were about 18” high the Swede  
crop was practically  smothered  and the weeds were pulled out to 
prevent  seeding.
Summary
1. Swede growing  by the stale seedbed  method  can give satisfactory
crops of turnips  and swedes.
2. The optimum  age for the stale seedbed  is 3-4 weeks  and it should  not
be prepared  until late April. Too early preparation  does not permit  
all weed seeds to emerge  in the 4 weeks and if left longer than 4 
weeks the soil hardens,  giving a reduced  crop population  and 
reduced  yield. The weeds Redshank,  Knot grass and Shepherd ’s 
purse will recover  from paraquat  application  and take over a stale 
seedbed  completely  if the seedbed  age extends  beyond  4 weeks.
3. In grazing  trials with swedes there were no varietal  preferences  
when grazed by sheep. Bangholm  swedes were responsible  for a 
greater  loss of milk teeth in hoggets  than were either Broadland  
swedes  or Greentop  turnips.
4. Average  liveweight  gain of hoggets  on swedes  showed  wide varia ­
tion between  breeds  and between  years.
5. The percentage  of the swede utilised  in situ was as high in crops  
grown on the flat as that from crops grown on the drills. The 
utilisation  was better in low density  (20,000/ac.)  than high-density  
(45,000/ac.)  crops.

THE IRISH GRASSLAND  ASSOCIATION  was 
founded  in 1947 with the aim of promoting  the knowl ­
edge of grassland  production.
In 1961, the name of the Association  was modified, 
in recognition  of the fact that good grassland  husbandry  
is intimately  associated  with, and inseparable  from, good  
livestock  husbandry.
The Association  provides  an opportunity  for those 
interested  in modern  grassland  farming  to gather and 
interchange  views and ideas; it provides  a platform  for 
forward-looking  farmers  and scientists  to expound  their  
ideas; it fosters  and encourages  research  into the produc ­
tion and utilisation  of grassland,  and it aims to co­
operate with organisations  which has in common  the 
improvement  of grassland  farming.
If you or your organisation  would like to join the 
Irish Grassland  and Animal  Production  Association,  the 
Secretary,  24 Earisfort  Terrace,  Dublin 2, would be 
pleased  to hear from you. mu
