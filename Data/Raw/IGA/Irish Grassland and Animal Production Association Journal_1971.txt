Editorial
Dr. Jim O’Grady is Head of the Agricultural  Institute ’s Pig Husbandry  
Department  which is located  at Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy.  
He was born in Killenaule,  Co. Tipperary  and took his early education  
at the local National  School and the Patrician  Brothers  Schools  at 
Fethard  and Ballyfin.  Following  Secondary  School  he attended  the one 
year course  in Agriculture  at the Albert  College,  Glasnevin.  From there  
he enrolled  at University  College  Dublin  and graduated  with an Honours  
B.Agr.Sc.  degree  in 1958. He received  his M.Sc. degree  from University 
College  Cork in 1961 and Ph.D.  from that College  in 1967.
In 1960 he spent a period of study with Professor  I. A. M. Lucas  
and Dr. G. A. Lodge at the Rowett  Research  Institute  in Aberdeen.  
In 1967 he was awarded  a Senior Visiting  Fellowship  by the Royal  
Irish Academy  and studied  pig production  in the U.S. He spent a year 
from August  1970 to August  1971 at the University  of Alberta  where 
he was engaged  as a post-doctoral  fellow on research  into the energy 
nutrition  of young  pigs with Dr. J. P. Bowland.
Dr. O’Grady has had published  some 25 scientific  papers and 50 
popular  articles. He has lectured  at farming  and scientific  meetings  
both in Ireland  and abroad.  In 1970 he presented  a series of 5 pro­
grammes  on pig production  for Telefis  Eireann.  His research  responsib ­
ility is concerned  with the nutrition,  management  and carcass  quality  
of pigs. His personal  research  is now concerned  with sows and young  
pigs.
Introduction
At the outset I would hke to express  my thanks to the Trustees  for 
inviting  me to give this fourth  Edward  Richards-Orpen  Memorial  lecture.
1 have now been engaged  in pig research  for over thirteen  years. In 
that period there have been many changes.  The annual  output  of pigs 
has increased  by over 90 per cent, the greater  part of this increased  
production  being  exported  so that the industry  now ranks  among  the top 
earners  of foreign  currency.  The genetic  merit of the national  pig herd 
has improved  markedly.  We now have leaner,  faster growing  and more  
efficient  pigs that at any time in the past. The controversy  in the past 
is no longer with us and fatteners  are now happy to examine  housing  
from an economic  point of view, while keeping  in mind the type of 
system they plan to operate.  The concern  with animal protein,  of so 
much concern  a decade  ago. is lost and replaced  by an appreciation  of 
amino  acid balance  and relative  costs.
The idea of co-operative  fattening  centres  — then in embryo  state — 
is now firmly established  and supplemented  with weaner groups as 
well as pig selling  and feed purchasing  groups.
Many held the view at that time that indoor  sow keeping  could not 
be practiced  without serious loss in performance.  Today one hardly  
considers  systems  other than total confinement  ones and herd outputs  
in excess of 20 pigs per sow per annum are regularly  achieved  with 
such systems.
As in other branches  of agriculture  the past decade  has been one of 
very rapid change  and progress  for the pig industry.  The challenge  of 
the future  remains  a demanding  one. Although  production  efficiency  has 
increased  so has competition  and there is still a very great spread in 
the level of efficiency  achieved.  Better organisation  is certainly  one of 
the most urgent  needs. A successful  pig industry  requires  high levels of 
efficiency  at production,  feed compounding,  meat processing  and market ­
ing levels.  There  is need for much  closer  integration  of all these activities  
in the future.
TRACE  MINERALS
The earlier  experiments  undertaken  at Moorepark  reflected  the prob ­
lems encountered  at that time and indicated  a low level of management.  
Where sows were kept indoors  during lactation,  anaemia  became  a 
problem  on some farms. Oral dosing  with iron salts or putting  earth  
into the pen each day solved  the problem  but were laborious.  Injectable
5
iron preparations  had just come on the market  and we found in several 
experiments  that these were as good as oral dosing.  Work in Britain  (I) 
demonstrated  that higher  strength  injections  (200 mg Fe) gave improved  
results and in a large scale experiment  we tested one of the higher  
strength  products  against oral dosing (2). The results clearly showed 
the superiority  of the injectable  product.

We have had no reason to modify  our recommendations  since then.
Copper  sulphate  (0.1 per cent in the diet) had been shown  to improve  
growth  rate and feed conversion  eftiecicncy  as early as 1955 (3). Because  
it was cheaper  than anti-biotics,  gave the same degree  of growth  pro­
motion and did not present problems  of bacterial  resistence,  copper  
supplementation  of pig diets gained widespread  acceptance.  Occasional  
reports  of toxicosis,  when fed at the recommended  level, reduced  con­
fidence  in its acceptance.  An outbreak  of copper  poisoning  occurred  at 
Moorepark  in 1965. Previously  copper  supplementation  had been used 
successfully  for a number  of years. Experimental  work (4) undertaken  
then showed  that the zinc and protein  levels in the diet were involved 
although  the former  had the greater  effect. Some selected  results are 
given in Tables  2 and 3. It was clear that the addition  of 130 ppm Zinc  
completely  eliminated  the deaths  associated  with copper  supplementation  
and reduced  liver storage  of copper  by 33 per cent. This clearly  demon ­
strated  interaction  between  zinc and copper  probably  also explained  the 
intermittent  occurrence  of copper  toxicity.  Wheat  offals are known  to 
contain  high levels of zinc and so their inclusion  probably  supplied  
adequate  zinc in many  diets. Since  this period  I have not seen any further  
reports  of copper  toxicosis  in pigs and as a feed additive  its safety is 
not now questioned.

More recently  concern  about the use of antibiotics  in feeds has in­
creased  and legislation  in many countries  prohibits  the use of some or 
all antibiotics  as feed additives.  This has had the effect of increasing  
the importance  of copper sulphate  as a growth stimulant.  There is 
presently  great commercial  interest  in the development  of non antibiotic  
additives  and a number  are available.  It is not clear if they offer advan ­
tages over copper  sulphate.
Trace mineral concentrations  vary with ingredients  and probably  
with the region  where  grains and other  feeds  are grown.  We have adopted  
the practice  of adding  a supplement  to all feeds  which  meets  requirements  
even where feedstuffs  have unusually  low concentrations.  At present  
it costs 5.5p per ton to add iron, iodine,  zinc, copper,  manganese  and 
selenium  at nutritionally  required  levels. As the toxic level of these  
minerals  ranges  from 40 to 200 times  the nutritional  requirement  there is 
no danger attached  to adding a blanket  allowance.  In this situation  
research  into trace minerals  is low on our list of priorities.
FEED INGREDIENTS  — ALTERNATIVES
Dairy byproducts.  The past decade  has seen very great changes  in the 
supply of dairy byproducts  available  for animal  feed. Skim milk was 
important  in the 50’s and 60’s but is now so valuable  for processing  as 
to exclude  it from pigfeeding,except  in those areas where  rationalisation  
of dairy processing  is retarded.  Production  of whey on the other hand  
has increased  from 9.3 million  gallons in I960 to about 100 million 
gallons in 1972. Predictions  of future production  arc liable to great  
errors. With milk production  up 7.5% in 1972 and with cheese pro­
duction  in 1972 nearly  50% higher  than in 1971 it is possible  to visualise 
that production  of whey will reach 200 or even 300 million  gallons  per 
annum  before  the end of this decade.
The availability  of whey offers the Iri.sh pig industry  a clearcut  ad­
vantage  over its competitors.  In 1972 the total amount  of whey available  
represented  4.5% of total pig feed or 7.5% of feed used in the fattening  
period.  Data available  from Moorepark  (6. 7, 8 Tables  4 and 5) clearly  
show that liquid whey can represent  up to 22% of total feed in fattening  
while maintaining  maximum  performance.  If whey is concentrated  or 
dried the limit on inclusion  can be raised  to nearly  40%.

If whey is available  delivered  at Ip per gallon and compound  feed 
costs £45 per ton there is a saving  of 1.5p for every 3 gallons  of whey  
used on £500,000  per annum on a usage of 100 million  gallons.  It is 
worth emphasising  that this sum would offset a £2 per ton carriage  
charge  on the total feed required  to produce  an extra million  pigs (5) 
and is unquestionably  a valuable  asset that must be utilised  fully. In 
my opinion  the research  has been done on whey feeding.  It is up to 
producers  separately  or in groups  to solve the necessary  organisational  
problems  associated  with fully utilising  this natural  advantage.
Grains  and offals. Despite  good housing  and management  and rations  
that were obviously  adequate  in crude protein,  slow growth  and poor  
F.C.E. have been a serious problem  on many farms. To attempt  a 
solution  to this problem  Tom Hanrahan  and 1 initiated  a project  into 
the interchangeability  of feed ingredients.  Imported  wheat offals  
appeared  of questionable  value and this assessment  was confirmed  in 
digestible  studies.  (9) Some  results  are given in Table  6.
Table  6

Digestibility  % 77.2 72.0 68.3
Digestible  energy  Mcal/kg 2.94 2.73 2.52
Although  gross energy  of pollard  containing  diets was slightly  higher  
than that of barley based ones, per cent digestibility  decreased  by about  
0.2 units for each 1 per cent inclusion  of pollard.  From this it was 
calculated  that the D.E. concentration  of imported  pollard was 2.2 
Meal/kg  compared  to a value of 3.0 Meal in the case of barley — a 
decrease  of almost  27 per cent. Growth  trials confirmed  the digestibility  
data. The inclusion  of 20 and 40 per cent pollard  reduced  growth  rate 
by 6 and 12 per cent respectively  while F.C.E. was poorer  by corre,s-  
ponding  amounts.
An extension  of this work by Tom Hanrahan  (19) has shown that 
maize  and milo are some 10 per cent higher  than barley  in D.E. although  
in growth  trials their superiority  was less — some 3 to 5 per cent. This 
probably  reflects poorer  amino acid balance  but unquestionably  they 
represent  better value. Work just completed  shows the D.E. value of 
native  wheat  to be variable.  On the basis of work in other  countries  one 
would have expected  wheat to be considerably  superior  to barley.

Any expansion  of pig production  will necessitate  increased  imports  of 
feed ingredients  and only through  a knowledge  of the nutritive  value  
of the different  alternatives  can a rational  import  policy be based. In a 
world where  efficiency  is the basis of success  Irish farmers  cannot  afford 
the luxury  of lower quality  feeds. Table 7 shows the imports  of wheat  
offals since 1965 and the maximum  extent  to which  they could  have been 
included  in the average  pig ration.  It is evident  that foreign  pollard  is on 
the wane, whether  through  an appreciation  of our findings  or not I 
cannot be sure. It is however  a development  in the right direction.

1 do not condemn  the use of low energy  ingredients  per se. If price is 
right they may represent  good value. The feeder  however  must be made  
aware  that the resultant  diet is lower in energy  and will result in poorer  
performance.  Only then can he determine  the economics  of using such 
feeds. Under  E.E.C.  conditions  however  the relative  cost of energy  will 
be higher  and low energy  feeds incur higher  transport  costs per unit of 
energy.  For example,  2 tons of maize have the same nutritive  value as 
3 tons of foreign  pollard  and the relative  transport  costs of nutrients  
may be even more divergent  when volume  is taken into account.
Where  a wider range of ingredients  is available  more complex  diets  
can be expected  — in many  instances  formulated  by linear  programming.  
The feeding  value of such diets depends  on the nutritional  specification  
used and on the accuracy  of the information  available  on ingredient  
composition.  It is easy to visualise  the error resulting  from assuming  
that foreign  pollard  contains  2.7 Meal DE/kg  when in fact its energy 
content  is only 2.2 Mcal/kg.  There  are many  other  instances  where  errors
10
can result from inadequate  knowledge  of ingredient  composition  or of 
variations  v/ithin  a particular  ingredient.
The increasing  emphasis  on environmental  protection  and the need 
to avoid pollution  is another  factor in favour  of the use of high energy 
diets. Our data showed  that the inclusion  of 40 per cent pollard  in diets  
increased  the output on wet faeces by about 60 per cent and that of 
faecal  dry matter  by about  35 per cent.
Many more restrictions  about the use of various  feeds are known 
to man than to the pig. We are now feeding  80% wheat diets to pigs 
without  any of the predicted  digestive  upsets. Similarly  we are using  
levels of molasses  a good deal higher  than recommended  and not yet 
encountering  the expected  scours.
I envisage  a continuing  need for more information  on the nutritive  
value  of many unconventional  ingredients  and so consider  the programme  
of research  on this topic nov/ underway  at Moorepark  of great import ­
ance. It is a pleasure  to acknowledge  the support  given to this work by 
the U.S. Feed Grains  Council  from 1967 to 1972 and the fact that this 
support  has now been taken over by a group  of Co-operatives.
CARCASS  QUALITY
Success  in exporting  pigmeat  can hardly be achieved  without  having  
genetically  lean pigs and in my introduction  I have mentioned  the 
improvements  that have taken place in the Irish national  herd in recent  
years. Within  any particular  strain of pig however  carcass  leanness  and 
efficiency  of production  can be influenced  in a number  of ways. These  
effects  are important  both to the producer  in that they influence  profit ­
ability and to the processor  in that they effect the quality  of the final 
product.
Sex has the largest  effect on carcass  leanness.  Under  standard  housing, 
feeding  and management,  boars are considerably  leaner  than gilts which 
in turn are leaner  than castrates.  As boar taint prevents  the use of entire  
males, this superiority  cannot  be exploited  at present.  The rapid con­
centration  of fattening  into large units does allow separate  housing  of 
sexes which can then either  be fed differently  or slaughtered  at different  
weights  to manipulate  carcass  leanness.  Where  pigs are being diverted  
into markets  other than Wiltshire  bacon this latter may be attractive.  
The potential  for such manipulation  is .clear from data published  in 
1966 (10). Both fat measurements  and dissectable  fat increased  at higher  
slaughter  weights,  while meat percentage  decreased  (Table 8). In the 
same experiment  sex effects  on carcass  quality  were demonstrated  and 
are shown  in Table  9.

Meat % 64.3 60.7
It can be calculated  from the data given in Tables  8 and 9 that the 
sex differences  are comparable  to those brought  about by a difference 
of 15 kg in slaughter  weight. For Wiltshire  cure standard  weights  of 
sides are of great importance.  Should  pigs be cut up and sold as pork  
cuts or other processed  products  however  it may be possible  to use 
different  slaughter  weights  to even out leanness.
Higher  levels  of feed result  in faster  growth  but also in fatter  carcasses  
so that the relative  advantages  of each effect are important  in determin ­
ing profitability.  The carcass  studies referred  to above indicated  that 
fast growth  could be combined  with lean carcasses  by reducing  slaughter  
weight.  Higher  feeding  giving  an 11 per cent increase  in growth  rate can 
be practiced  without  deterioration  in leanness  if pigs are slaughtered  
7 kg lighter.  This combination  gives a 20 per cent increase  in throughput  
of pigs.
Slaughter  weight has been a bone of contention  in pig production  
for many years. There  will always  be some conflict  between  the require ­
ments of factories  and markets  and the production  costs of farmers.  
Undoubtedly  killing costs are lower where weights  are higher. Some 
factories  may have outlets  for fat and so the increased  fat content  of 
heavier carcasses  may not influence  profitability  unduly. Processors
12
will undoubtedly  do their own economics  but it is important  for every ­
one to have information  on basic production  costs. In the Netherlands  
this conflict  between  production  and processing  costs is solved by pay­
ing a higher  price per kg carcass  for pigs of heavier  weights.  The earlier  
experiments  referred  to (10) were further  examined  by Kearney  (11) and 
feed conversion  efficiency  calculated  at various  weights.  Overall  per­
formance  in the experiment  was not good as at that stage we had not 
developed  what has since become  known as the ‘Moorepark  Ration ’. 
It was however  comparable  to the level of performance  achieved  pres­
ently on many farms i.e. daily gain 558 g (1.23 lb) and F.C.E. 3.7. the 
relationship  between  weight  of pig and F.C.E.  is shown in Table 10.

102.7 226 5.8
This experiment  showed  that there was increase  in overall  daily gain 
when pigs were kept to weights  in excess  of 175 lb.
More recently  Hanrahan  and Carroll (12) have undertaken  some 
extremely  comprehensive  work on a wider range of slaughter  weights.  
The same pattern  emerges  showing  that keeping  pigs to higher  weights 
does not improve  rate of gain while F.C.E.  constantly  deteriorates.  This 
aspect is shown in Figure I. In this experiment  overall  rate of gain 
was in excess of 800 g/day (1.75 Ib) and F.C.E. up to 85kg (187 lb) 
3.14. Feed conversion  for the increments  above  this have been calculated  
and are shown in Table 11. The data clearly  demonstrate  the increased  
feed necessary  to put on liveweight  as the pig gets heavier  even where  
overall performance  is extremely  high. Where  overall  performance  is 
poor weight  gains above 180 Ib is clearly unprofitable  at normal  feed 
and pig prices.

HOUSING  OF BACON  PIGS
Perhaps  no area of pig production  was so confused  at the beginning 
of the last decade.  Several  types of fattening  house  had their supporters  
and detractors  all of whom believed  that efficient  pig production  was 
impossible  without  the aid of their chosen  house.  The fact that facilities  
were being built at Moorepark  offered  a unique  opportunity  to examine  
different  types of house. The results  are now well known (20). In two 
experiments  involving  a total of 1,328 pigs, performance  on a range of 
feed levels and slaughter  weights  was compared  in Danish,  Jordan  and 
Solari houses.  Overall,  pigs in the Danish  house  grew 5.2 per cent faster  
and converted  feed some 5 per cent more efficiently  than those in the 
other houses.  Carcass  differences  were small but tended to favour  the 
Jordan  and Solari houses.  Despite  the better  performance  in the Danish  
house an economic  evaluation  of the data showed  profitability  per pig 
to be greater  in the Jordan  house  due to its lower capital  cost and con­
sequent  lower housing  charges.  A most important  concept  was apparent  
from this finding  — namely  that performance  as such is not the sole 
criterion  by which a house  must be judged.  If housing  charges  are lower 
a slightly  lower level of pig performance  can still leave most profit. In 
a situation  where capital is limiting  this factor of lower housing  cost 
becomes  even more important  as it allows not alone a lower housing  
charge  per pig but also a greater  size of enterprise for the same 
investment.  For example  a choice  of a £10 per pig house  vs. a £25 per 
pig house allows  a 20 per cent increase  in enterprise  size for the same  
investment  using present  day weaner  and feed prices. Following  this 
earlier work, findings  from Britain  and from Moorepark  (21) demon ­
strated that the differences  recorded  between  our houses could be 
entUcly  accounted  for by the fact that feeding  was from troughs  in the 
Danish  and off the floor in the other types. Developments  since then 
allow trough feeding  in Jordan houses so that they or other efficient  
low cost houses  are more profitable  on a per pig basis as well as demand ­
ing a lower  investment,  per pig space.
14
Occasionally  one still hears of statements  from other countries  that 
the Jordan  house does not work. Irish pig keepers  planning  for expan ­
sion might well be pleased.  It has been clear for at least a decade  that 
the Jordan  house requires  a climate  having  neither  extremes  of heat or 
cold. Most countries  do not have such a climate.  It is however  one of 
our great advantages  in pig production  as well as in grass growth.
Developments  in dairying  and whey production  emphasise  one further  
advantage  of the Jordan  house. It is designed  to withstand  humid  con­
ditions.  Where  large quantities  of whey are fed it is impossible  to avoid 
humid conditions  so that the Jordan  house and whey feeding  are com­
plementary  and represent  the two great natural advantages  of Irish 
pig production.
The Jordan  house has often been described  as an unventilated  hou.se  
and this is completely  inaccurate.  It is a draught  free house but well 
ventilated.  An example  of the elTects of inadequate  ventilation  has 
recently  been observed  at Moorepark  where a prototype  new design 
of house  — the Gemini  was tested.  Some results  are given in Table 11A

FEEDING  AND MANAGEMENT  OF SOWS  AND LITTERS
Developments  in intensive  sow keeping  were slow in coming  compared  
to those in managing  growing-finishing  pigs. There were a number  of 
reasons  for this. Outdoor  exercises  were considered  essential  for normal  
reproductive  performance.  This belief reflected  a lack of information  
on the nutritional  needs of the sow as well as a belief that exercise  was 
an essential  component  of the normal processes  of pregnancy  and 
lactation.
The development  of total confinement  housing  — firstly  group  housing  
with individual  feeding  and later stalls — gave the necessary  stimulus  
to initiate  studies  on the protein  and energy  requirements  of sows.
Pregnancy.  Initial studies at Moorepark  were concerned  with the 
effects  of level and pattern  of feeding  in gestation  (13). In conjunction  
with other studies  abroad  this work demonstrated  that low feed intakes
in gestation  depressed  birth  weights  and that this etTect remained  to 
weaning  and indeed  to slaughter  where a 1 lb difference  in birthweight  
resulted  in a 9 day difference  in age at slaughter.  The extent of some 
effects  are shown in Table 12. It is pertinent  to note that in this as in 
most other experiments  low feed intake  in pregnancy  did not influence 
number  of piglets  born. The effects  on birthweight  and subsequent  per­
formance  can be caused  either by a low level of feed as shown or by 
a higher  level of a lower  energy  feed. Further  studies  (14) demonstrated  
that 2.0 kg per day of a barley  based  diet (3.0 Meal DE/kg)  gave normal  
birthweights  (Table  13).

This level of feed in pregnancy  has been used as a standard  in the 
Moorepark  herd for many  years and is totally  satisfactory  under reason ­
able environmental  conditions  and for sows free of heavy  parasite  infes ­
tation. It may be that we have not adequately  stressed  these qualifica ­
tions. Certainly  we have found cases of extremely  thin sows on farms  
where this allowance  appears  to have been adhered  to. Comparisons  of 
sow and weaner  diets (15) have shown  that FCE and presumably  DE of 
some commercial  formulations  can be up to 18.5 per cent poorer  than
our standard  known  to contain  3.0 Meal DE/kg.  If such a formulation  
is fed sows would require  2.37 kg (5^ lb) to supply  the same energy  as 
2 kg of our recommended  standard.  This again illustrates  the necessity 
for knowledge  of the energy concentrations  of diets if management  
decisions  are to be soundly  based.
Nutritional  recommendations  have indicated  increased  requirements  
for protein and energy with the advancement  of pregnancy  in sows.  
V/hilc these are based on metabolic  data they do involve  a complicated  
feeding  system. Con.sequently  we considered  it important  to compare  
such a system  with one allowing  a constant  feed level throughout  preg­
nancy.  Some  results  arc given in Table 14 and clearly  show no advantage  
whatsoever  from the more complicated  system.  More recently  Elsley et 
al (16) examined  constant  and variable  systems  where the overall  level 
of feed was lower.

No. weaned 7.9 7.6
Litter  wt. at birth 12.9 12.9
Litter  wt. at weaning 118.5 117.0
Again no improvement  on the constant  system was obtained.  It is 
now an accepted  maxim  of sow management  that litter size should  be 
standardised  soon after birth by fostering  on or off piglets.  Thus standard  
feeding  systems  can be safely recommended  in pregnancy  and lactation.  
This is an important  advance  in management  and allows  labour  output  
to be increased.  In turn this allows bigger sow herds on many mixed  
farms  and improves  the structure  of the industry.
Rather  surprisingly  all recent  research  indicates  that the sow requires  
less protein than previously  estimated.  This is easily explained  from  
findings  in Britain  and France  that protein  utilisation  is more efficient  in 
pregnancy.  While no experiments  have been completed  on this topic  
in Ireland,  findings  from abroad  have been implemented  in Moorepark  
and a 13 per cent crude protein  diet has been u.sed as a standard  for 
some 4 years with excellent  results.  The vast majority  of compounders  
now market  such a sow feed.
17
Lactation : Two experiments  have been undertaken  to examine  the 
response  of lactating  sows to quantity  and quality  of protein.  In the 
first of these (14) reproductive  performance  was equally  good at 11.7 
and 15.8 per cent crude  protein  in the diet and where  fishmeal  or ground ­
nut meal were used as the source  of supplementary  protein  (Table 15).

2 86.4 84.1 84.2 86.2
3 80.0 86.3 86.8 79.4
An experiment  has just been completed  (17) where the low protein  
control  has only 9.3 per cent crude protein and this is supplemented  
with synthetic  amino acids and different  levels of soyabean  meal in 
an attempt  to obtain  information  on the limiting  amino  acids in lactation.  
During  each of three lactations  there were no differences  in litter per­
formance  or in milk composition  between  treatments  so that sows getting  
diets composed  only of barley,  vitamins  and minerals  performed  similarly  
to those given diets having 11.8 and 14.3 per cent crude protein.  There  
were no indications  of a response  to supplementation  of barley or 
barley-soya  diets with lysine and methionine.  Sows given lower protein  
diets lost more weight  after weaning  their first and second  litters. This 
latter effect is important  and further  studies  are underway  to examine  
its causes.
It is clear however  that the sow is much more efficient  in utilising 
dietary  protein  than had been expected  some years ago. It is also inter ­
esting that weight  change  and regularity  of breeding  are the most sen­
sitive areas  rather  than yield or composition  of milk.
Energy  requirement  for a 6 week lactation  were examined  in a joint 
experiment  undertaken  at the Rowett  Institute,  Aberdeen  and at Moore ­
park (18). Low energy  levels in lactation  (4.2-4.5  kg/day)  progressively
18
reduced  milk yield from Isl to 3rd lactation  and this was reflected  in 
differences  in litter weights  in the 3rd lactation.  When  slaughtered  at this 
stage it was seen that body fat reserves  of sows had been seriously  
depleted  where  dietary  energy  was restricted.  Some of the more import ­
ant results  are siven  in Tables  16 and 17.

Skim and fat % 16.5 17.5 22.7 26.9
Meat % 68.1 68.2 63.0 60.2
This experiment  illustrated  very clearly  that sows can draw on body  
reserves  to maintain  milk yield. There  is obviously  a limit to the length 
of time they can continue  under such a system  and in the experiment  
referred  to this seemed  to be about 3 lactations.  Where  it is normal  and 
economical  to keep sows in the herd for several  cycles,  only results  of 
long term experiments  can give accurate  information  on treatment  
effects. Unfortunately  this means  fewer experiments.  It also means  that 
U.S. results,  where it is general  to discard  the sow after one litter, are 
of lesser value.
On the positive  side, results in the joint experiment  demonstrated  
complete  consistency  between  centres  so that we can avail of British  
findings  with considerable  confidence  in the future.  Overall  conclusions  
from the study show that where moderate  feeding is practiced  in 
gestation  (2.0 kg/day)  and with 5 or 6 week lactations,  sows should  be
19
fed highly  in lactation,  i.e. up to 7.0 kg/day  for best overall  eftieciency.  
The advantages  of this system  will be most pronounced  in the 3rd and 
subsequent  lactations.
There remains  the period between  weaning  and remating,  the length 
of which is a very important  determinant  of sow output. Very little 
is known  about  optimum  nutrition  in this period.  Work  at the University  
of Nottingham  suggested  a gain from Hushing  during  oestrus  but further  
work was unable to confirm  the earlier findings.  Rather  than look at 
the oestrus period we decided  to examine  feeding  during the entire  
period and an experiment  has been completed  where three levels of 
feed were given from 24 hours  post weaning  to the 2nd service.  Follow ­
ing this all sows received  the standard  allowance  of 2.0 kg/day in 
gestation.  Some  results  are given in Table 18.
Table 18
Effect of level of feed post weaning  on sow performance
Level of feed kg/day
2.0 3.5 5.0
Days weaning  to mating 6.1 5.1 5.5
Litter  size at birth 12.0 11.6 10.9
These  differences  were not significant  but do show some slight advan ­
tage for the medium  level of feed. As environmental  conditions  on many  
farms may not be as good as those at Moorepark  this level of feed 
seems a reasonable  compromise.  In summary  then a level of 12.5 to 
13.5 per cent crude protein  seems suitable  for sows at all stages  of pro­
duction.  Where  diets contain  3.0 Meal DE/kg  recommended  daily levels  
of feed are 2.0 kg in gestation,  6.0 to 7.0 kg in lactation  and 3.5 kg 
between  weaning  and re-mating.  This system  of course  applies  to 5 or 
6 week weaning. Different  systems  may be necessary  with earlier  
weaning.
The past decade  has seen a great increase  in intensive  sow keeping. 
It is not unreasonable  to ask if there are any indications  that sows are 
reacting  to this and that regularity  of breeding,  litter size and longevity 
are now poorer  than when sows generally  had access  to pasture,  a good 
deal more exercise  and both higher levels of feed and protein.  Data  
from Moorepark  might give some clues here as we have gone through  
the developments  mentioned  in the past decade.  Every indication  we 
have shows that the overall  position  is improving.  For example  in our 
first sow experiment  81.8% of control  sows produced  third litters; in 
the most recent experiment  the comparable  figure is 86.3%. Number
20
weaned  per litter has increased  by 0.84 in the same period  and weaning  
to mating  interval  and conception  ratios are now close to the biological  
limit. Of 337 sows mated  at Moorepark  in the first 10 months  of 1972,  
314 or 93.2 per cent conceived  and of the 23 repeats  all but 2 were 
pregnant  after the repeat mating. The monthly  pattern is given in 
Table 19. A high proportion  of gilts (30%)  were included  in the figures  
for August  to October.
Table 19

Month mated repeats ratio %
January 39 2 94.9
February 32 3 90.6
March 31 2 93.5
April 27 4 85.2
May 29 1 96.6
June 34 2 94.1
July 33 3 90.9
August 42 1 97.6
September 38 2 94.7
October 32 3 90.6
Weaning  to mating intervals  in control sows are only 7 days on 
average  and this represents  over 2.3 litters per sow per annum  and 20.7 
pigs per sow per annum  with 9 pigs weaned  per litter — a highly  profit ­
able situation.
Future Research : A theoretical  examination  of the output figures  
just described  shows  two potential  areas of improvement  — more litters  
per annum which means earlier weaning  and more pigs weaned  per 
litter. In both cases a different  type of re.search  involving  whole herd 
systems  is required.  There is a considerable  volume  of research  docu ­
menting  the optimum  environmental  requirements  of the young pig. I 
believe  we now need work on fitting these needs into a sow and litter  
situation  or indeed  a house  of sows and litters. This means  co-operative  
work involving  the disciplines  of physiology,  husbandry  and engineering. 
I am convinced  that as much as 2 extra pigs could be reared  per litter if 
such a project  were successful  in devising  the correct  house and fitting  
it into a pig keeping  .system.
In relation  to earlier  weaning  it is clear from work abroad  that the 
physiology  of the sow presents  greater  problems  than the rearing  of 
the early weaned  pigs. Again this must be examined  in the context  of 
a whole  herd system.
21
Perhaps  no area of pig keeping  generated  more controversy  in the 
past than housing.  Today our ability to produce  pigs profitably  in 
cheaper  houses  than any of our competitors  require  is a major  advantage  
which  will benefit  the Irish pig industry  in the future.  Compared  to mo^st  
European  countries  it represents  a saving of up to £1.00 per pig in 
production  costs and together  with the availability  of whey constitutes  
our greatest  advantage.  No doubt we can make further  improvements  
which will be labour  saving  and ease management.  We must never  forget  
however  that housing  here has to exploit  our moderate  climate.
An area which is in the news and undoubtedly  needs research  is 
effluent  disposal.  It is crazy to accept  that the disposal  of animal  wastes 
presents  a pollution  problem  in Ireland  when it can be handled  in the 
Netherlands  where the density  of pig production  is at least 15 times 
that here and is combined  with a high density  of humans.  Regrettably  
many of the planning  authorities  are imposing  inflexible  regulations  
which could prevent  the pig industry  from achieving  its potential  con­
tribution  to the economy.  Research  is urgently  needed  into the efficient  
use of animal wastes with emphasis  on fertiliser  value rather than 
pollution  potential.  Only on the basis of information  from such a pro­
ject can sensible  planning  legislation  be drawn  up.
Finally  a word of warning  in relation  to breeding.  It has recently  
been postulated  that intensive  selection  for leanness  without  due regard  
for other criteria  has resulted  in disease  prone pigs of low fecundity  in 
Denmark  and the U.S. Proving  or disproving  such an assertion  may not 
be possible.  It does seem important  to me however  to record that work 
in Canada  shows that selection  for growth rate and vigour can be 
combined  with that for leanness  without  any slowing  in the rate of 
improvement  in either  characteristic.
Acknowledgements:  The work which I have described  was made  
possible  only by the constant  help of all my colleagues  at Moorepark,  
at other Institute  centres  and abroad.  If 1 attempted  to name them all! 
the list would be a long one. I would like however  to single  out three : 
Michael  Walshe  who was a constant  help for nearly  twelve  years, Tom  
Hanrahan  who has shared  in all my work since the beginning  of 1965 
and Bill Murphy  who has been herdsman  on sows since 1961. To these 
and to all who have helped  through  work,  encouragement  and discussions  
I am extremely  grateful.

THE IRISH GRASSLAND  ASSOCIATION  was 
founded  in 1946 with the aim of promoting  the knowl ­
edge of grassland  production.
In 1961, the name of the Association  was modified,  
in recognition  of the fact that good grassland  husbandry  
is ultimately  associated  with, and inseparable  from, good  
livestock  husbandry.
The Association  provides  an opportunity  for those  
interested  in modern  grassland  farming  to gather and 
interchange  views and ideas; it provides  a platform  for 
forward-looking  farmers  and scientists  to e.xpound  their  
ideas;  it fosters  and encourages  research  into the produc ­
tion and utilisation  of gra.ssland,  and it aims to co­
operate  with organisations  which have in common  the 
improvements  of grassland  farming.
If you or your organisation  would like to join the 
Irish Grassland  and Animal  Production  Association,  the 
Secretary,  An Foras Taluntais,  Creagh,  Ballinrobe,  Co. 
Mayo, would be pleased  to hear from you
