Current  Trends  in Grassland  
Management  Research

Introduction
The objectives  of grassland  management  are (a) to ensure  an adequacy  of 
digestible  plant material  throughout  the growing  season as cheaply  as 
possible,  and (b) to utilize  the material  grown as efficiently  as possible 
without  impairing  the productive  capacity  of the sward.  It is the task of 
applied  research  to provide  information  on all major elements  of any 
grassland  management  system  and to incorporate  the key factors  into a 
workable  farm plan. Such a structural  plan for dairying  has been evolved 
at Moorepark.  The opening  sections  of this paper  will be concerned  with 
an examination  of its grazing  management components.  I will then discuss 
the possible  role of Italian  ryegrass  as a further  step in intensification.  
F inally,  I will illustrate  how a more detailed  knowledge  of plant response  
to defoliation  may lead to a more  rational  basis  for grassland  management.
When  does the winter  feeding  period  end?
It is advisable  on a dairy  farm to allow  lactating  cows onto grass,  their  
cheapest  source  of feed, as early  as possible  in spring when  two conditions  
are fulfilled.  These are: (a) the amount  of herbage  present  must be 
sufficient  to maintain  or increase  current  milk production;  (b) grazing  
should  not have any depressing  effect on subsequent  grass growth.
We have examined  the influence  of three dates of starting  grazing  in 
spring  on the regrowth  of a perennial  ryegrass  pasture.  Stock were used 
for grazing  only i.e. no animal  production  data was recorded,  and each 
grazing  was completed  within  a day.
The dates of grazing  were chosen  to represent  a range from normal  
(at Moorepark)  to extremely  late. The interval  between  successive  grazings 
was three weeks  and the initial  nitrogen  application  was made five weeks  
before  the earliest  time of starting  grazing.

The results obtained  are shown in Table 1. There were substantial  
differences  between  the amounts  of herbage  present  at the three times of 
initial  grazing.  However,  despite  that fact there was no difference  in total  
herbage  production  (up to late June)  in these trials.  Although  we have no 
animal  production  data available  to underwrite  the recommendation  for 
an early start to grazing,  a simple  calculation  from the results  shown  gives  
an indication  of how available  herbage  matched  animal  requirement.
Let us assume  that an 1,100 lb. cow yielding  35 lb milk daily has a dry 
matter  intake of 3.0% of body  weight.  This is equivalent  to 33 lb dry 
matter  per day. In early March  (Ti in Table 1) using nitrogen,  640 lb 
dry matter  per acre was the amount  of feed on offer. In the context  of a 
100-cow  unit on an 80-acre  farm, i.e. a stocking  rate of 1.25 L.U./acre,  
using 16x5 acre paddocks  there was sufficient  feed present  for 60 cows 
in each paddock  for one day even when allowance  is made  for only 65 % 
utilization  of grass by the grazing  animal.  It is realistic  to regard  this as a 
regularly  attainable  target and the practice  of early turnout  a desirable  
one particularly  at lower  stocking  rates.  It would  be worth  while  to examine  
this feature  of grazing  in an animal  production  trial.
How many  paddocks?
All dairy  farms  should  be sub-divided  into paddocks  for ease of manage ­
ment  alone.  Early  work  by Walshe  at Moorepark  indicated  that as stocking  
rate reached  1 cow/ 1.1 acres with low N usage there was a production  
advantage  of the order  of 15 % by adopting  a controlled  system  of grazing  
(in his case a 16-paddock  layout)  versus  a set-stocked  system.  The more  
obvious  questions  which arise with regard to any rotational  grazing  
system  are the number  of paddocks  necessary  and the rate of movement  
of stock around  these paddocks.
There is little agreement  at present  as to how many paddocks  are 
needed  nor is there any greater  measure  of agreement  as to whether  
animals  should  or should  not be changed  daily. Much  of the debate  on 
both questions  has been subjective  and so we designed  an experiment  
this year to help clarify  the situation.
A 10-paddock  system  was compared  with a 30-paddock  system  using 
cows at two stocking  rates —2.22  (M) and 2.86 (H) cows per acre—in the 
absence  of conservation.  On the 10-paddock  farmlets  animals  spent three  
days per paddock  at each grazing  whereas  on the 30-paddock  farmlets  
stock were moved  daily. All systems  were managed  uniformly  and the 
pastures  received  240 lb N per acre. Milk yields for the duration  of the 
trial (28 March/28  August  1972) are shown  in Table  2.

The effect of increasing  the number  of paddocks  from 10 to 30 ranged  
from 6 % at a medium  stocking  rate (2.22 cows/acre)  down to 2 % at a 
high stocking  rate (2.86 cows/acre).  The results  are interesting  when we
Pattern  of daily milk yield in two rotational  grazing  
s y s t e m s .Fig. 1
examine  the seasonal  yield pattern  which illustrates  clearly,  in this case 
at the medium  stocking  rate, the fluctuations  which  occur  in average  daily  
yields when occupation  time per paddock  is three days rather  than one 
day (Fig. 1). The difference  between  maximum  and minimum  daily yields  
on the 3-day  system  was 4-6 lb regularly  while the comparable  figure  for 
the daily change  system  was usually  1-3 lb. However,  despite  this fact the 
overall  difference  between  the two systems  remained  small since there  was 
a partially  compensating  effect in the 3-day system  of yield on the first 
day which  was generally  in excess  of that of the 1-day  system.  Nevertheless,  
it requires  only a marginal  increase  in yield per cow from a system  based  
on a larger  number  of paddocks  to counteract  the additional  fencing  costs  
incurred  through  further  sub-division.  At present  we would  suggest  that a 
farm should  be laid out in 10-12 paddocks  initially  with provision  for 
doubling  the number  as stock  numbers  are increased.
To speed  up or slow up the grazing  rotation?
The next section  will be devoted  to a consideration  of the most appro ­
priate  speed  of grazing  rotation.  There  are many  published  studies  on the 
effect of frequency  of cutting  on grass production  but none that I am 
aware of has been concerned  with the more important  effect of grazing  
frequency  on animal  production.  At Moorepark  we have examined  this 
aspect  over several  years.
(a) Grazing  interval —bullocks
The first trials were carried  out using  bullocks.  A 13.5 (F)—day grazing  
interval  (15-day  cycle) was compared  with an interval  of 27.0 (S) days 
(30-day  cycle). Two stocking  rates —2.0 (L) and 2.75 (H) bullocks  per 
acre—were used and these were maintained  throughout  the grazing  
season  (March-October).  Animals  were rotated  around  ten blocks  so that 
those on the fast (13.5 days) rotation  spent 1.5 days per paddock  whilst  
those on the slow (27 days) rotation  spent  3.0 days in each paddock.  The 
area received  280 lb nitrogen  per acre in 7 equal  applications.
Table  3

Year  2 830 850 920 1050
Year 3 860 770 730 770
Mean 800 750 780 880
The results  are shown  in Table  3. Overall  differences  were 6% in favour  
of fast rotation  at low stocking  rate and 13 % in favour  of slow rotation
at high stocking  rate but these differences  were not significant.  It appeared  
that extending  the grazing  interval  did not result in any advantage  in 
liveweight  terms until the stocking  rate was raised to 2.75 bullocks  per 
acre. Increasing  stocking  rate depressed  per animal  performance  by 24% 
whieh  indicated  that amount  of feed on offer at the higher  stocking  rate 
was limiting  output.  It was only then that slowing  the rotation  increased  
animal  output.
(b) Grazing  interval— cows
The second  series of grazing  interval  experiments  was carried  out with 
Friesian  cows (1969-71).  The general  layout  was similar  to that adopted  
for the trials with bullocks.
The same grazing  intervals —13.5 and 27.0 days—were compared.  The 
stocking  rates in 1969 and 1970 were 1.11 and 1.43 cows  per acre. Sufficient  
silage was conserved  from these areas to provide  adequate  winter  feed 
for the herds.  In 1971 conservation  was excluded  and stocking  rates were 
doubled  to become  2.22 and 2.86 cows per acre. As before,  a 10-paddock 
rotational  grazing  regime  was operated.  When  portions  of each treatment  
area were withdrawn  for conservation  purposes  the constant  interval  
between  grazings  was maintained  by increasing  the access time in the 
reduced  number  of paddocks  remaining.  The level of fertilizer  application  
averaged  240 lb nitrogen  per acre.
The results  are shown  in Table  4. The most striking  features  once again  
are that the influence  of grazing  interval  depended  on stocking  rate and 
that all differences  recorded  were small. At the lower stocking  rates in 
each year moving  the animals  around  rapidly  resulted  in slight increases 
in milk production  whilst  a slower  rotation  gave higher  output  of milk 
at the higher  stocking  rates.
Table  4

Interval  (days) 13.5 27.0 13.5 27.0

1970 570 535 625 585
1971 1075 1005 1005 1090
The practical  implication  from these studies  is that interval  between 
grazings  is not a major determinant  of animal  productivity.  However, 
small differences  due to change  in management  practice  should  not be 
disregarded  when the input cost is zero.
10
There  was no indication  in any of the trials  of a seasonal  swing  in favour  
of the slower rotation  at either stocking  rate. Furthermore,  in vitro  
digestibility  analyses  carried  out on herbage  during  1970 and 1971 demon ­
strated  close similarity  rather  than differences  in feed quality  on different  
treatments.
Italian  ryegrass —has it a place?
When  the full productive  capacity  of existing  pastures  has been utilized  
the search  for plant material  and management  practices  which  will raise  
output further is necessary.  According  to N.I.A.B.  ranking  lists the 
highest yielding  grass species is Italian ryegrass.  Two varieties  were  
selected  for assessment  over a range  of management  systems  at Moorepark  
in 1972. We are specifically  interested  in the possibility  of utilizing  the 
earliness  of spring  growth  of Italian  ryegrass  by grazing  and following  
this with a sequence  of conservation  cuts designed  to provide  a reasonable  
balance  between  dry matter  production  and digestibility.
The swards  used were direct  sown in late August/early  September  1971 
at a rate of 27 lb per acre. Blanca  white  clover  (2 Ib/acre)  was included  in 
the mixture  but its establishment  was very poor. The following  treatments  
were imposed:  (a) A 4-cut system  in which  the first cut was taken at an 
early date in May (Se) or two weeks later (Si) followed  by 3 cuts at 7 
week intervals —Gq; (b) Two grazings  at three-week  intervals  preceding  
a 4-cut system  as in (a)—Gg; (c) Three grazings  at three-week  intervals  
preceding  a 4-cut system  similar  to (a) but with first cut timed for three  
weeks  later on both Se and S1-G3.  Total  fertilizer  input  to all systems  was 
380 lb N, 32 units P, and 100 units K per acre. The results  are presented  
in Table  5.

G3S1 18300 17500
Production  from both varieties  was exceptionally  high—top yields  
were equivalent  to more  than 50 tons green matter  per acre—and in most  
instances  was a little better from RVP. It was particularly  encouraging  
to record  such a high total production  from a pasture  which  received  2-3 
early grazings  vis-a-vis  an area which was exclusively  cut. These results,
11
provided  they are consistently  repeatable,  help to clarify  the role which 
Italian  ryegrass  would  have on intensive  dairy farms.  When  managed  to 
provide  early ‘bite ’ before being set aside for at least two successive  
conservation  cuts and then reintroduced  into a grazing  system  these two 
varieties  appear  to be superior  in terms of dry matter  production  to any 
other  grasses  currently  available.  This suggests  their use on 20-25  % of the 
total farm area, particularly  if it were possible  to regenerate  such swards  
with minimum  expense,  disturbance,  and loss of grazing.  Sod-seeding  of 
RVP  into an existing  RVP  sward  (in late September  1972)  using  a Bettinson  
drill has resulted  in satisfactory  establishment.
However,  there are limitations  to the usefulness  of Italian ryegrass.  
Information  is required  on such factors  as its longevity  in the sward, 
total  dry matter  and digestible  dry matter  productivity  with time, response  
to nitrogen,  and performance  under  intensive  grazing.  For example,  work  
at Moorepark  indicates  very strongly  that if RVP is subjected  to frequent  
severe grazing  it can be rapidly  eliminated  from a pasture  and so a 
relatively  lenient  grazing  management  strategy  will have to be adopted.
Studies  on plant  development  under  different  defoliation  regimes
I mentioned  earlier that considerable  attention  both in this country  
and elsewhere  has been directed  towards  establishing  the output of 
pastures  under  varying  frequencies  of cutting.  In most reports  the results  
have been in agreement —the more often a grass sward is cut the lower 
the total dry matter  production.  We have obtained  the following  data 
(Table  6) in cutting  trials on swards  similar  to those where the grazing  
experiments  were conducted.

Results  such as these might  have been expected  to give a useful  guide 
to the optimum  length  of grazing  interval  but in fact as we have already  
seen a similar  pattern  of response  did not hold for animal  production  
when grass was grazed  in situ. There  is an evident  need for studies  which  
will help to define the relationship  between  sward productivity  and 
agency  of defoliation,  i.e. whether  cut or grazed,  at any given frequency  
of defoliation.  With  a view to obtaining  information  on the characteristics  
of grazed  pastures  a supplementary  study  was superimposed  on one of the
12
experiments  from  which  results  have been presented  already.  Concurrently  
a similar  study  was begun  on a cut pasture.
The underlying  reasons  governing  such an approach  are briefly as 
follows.  A grass  sward  undergoes  structural  changes  in response  to varying  
frequencies  of defoliation.  These  changes  are expressed  mainly  by altera ­
tions in plant density  and in canopy  structure.  The development  of a 
prostrate-type  plant under frequent  defoliation  and an erect-type  plant  
with infrequent  defoliation  is probable.  Morphological  adaptations  of 
this kind may confer  relative  advantages  in production  potential  terms  of 
particular  sward types under particular  conditions  of grassland  manage ­
ment. It was with these considerations  in mind that the measurements  
described  were made.
Stubble  samples  from grazed  and cut swards  were separated  into a 
number  of fractions.  For the purpose  of the present  discussion  consider  
three features  mainly —(a) the density  of the sward as indicated  by the 
tiller population;  (b) the make-up  of individual  tillers as indicated  by 
their relative  amounts  of leaf and stem ; (c) the quantity  of non-green  plant  
material  present  in the stubble.  There  was a considerable  degree  of intra ­
sample variation  but this is by no means unexpected  on permanent  
pasture.

High S.R. 14-day 40 95 43 59
28-day 34 103 30 73
In all instances  (Table 7) there was more residual  leaf on frequently  
defoliated  swards  than on those defoliated  infrequently.  A similar  situa ­
tion obtained  in cut swards.  Nevertheless,  as we have seen from the 
cutting  data in particular,  this apparent  advantage  was still associated  
with a considerably  lower total yield of grass dry matter.  In the results  
from the grazing  experiment  one could conclude  that at the low stocking  
rate the increased  amount  of leaf remaining  on the fast rotation  treatment  
(though  differences  were marginal)  may have accounted  partially  for the 
increase  in output  achieved.  But a similar  ratio of leaf/stem  obtained  at 
the higher  stocking  rate, yet the treatment  with most leaf on the stubble  
(fast rotation),  gave lower total animal  production.  Therefore,  a more
13
important  consideration  appeared  to be the effective  leaf area duration.  
It does seem that some factor  or factors  other than residual  leaf or even 
total stubble  weight must account  for the poor growth  of frequently  
defoliated  swards.  Conversely  there is no obvious  correlation  between  leaf 
and stem parameters  and the relatively  disappointing  performance  of the 
longer  interval  in animal  production  terms.

The tiller population  or density  (Table  8) of frequently  defoliated  swards 
was invariably  higher  than that of those defoliated  less frequently.  The 
amounts  of senescent  material  present  (Table  9) increased  progressively 
on all treatments  during  the sampling  period  and there was little evidence 
of either large or consistent  differences  between  the two frequencies  of 
defoliation.  Again  there is no indication  of a causal  relationship  between 
either  parameter  and total production.

28-day 88 118
Despite  this virtual  impasse  there remains  an obvious  visual  contrast  
between  the sward types which were induced  by the treatments  imposed.  
In the belief that structural  differences  between  swards  treated  in the 
manner  I have discussed  already  are implicated  in the differences  in 
productivity  recorded,  we are currently  pursuing  a line of investigation  
parallel  to the one I have just outlined.  Because  of the complexity  of 
permanent  pasture,  both from the sampling  and interpretative  viewpoints, 
these further studies are being carried out on newly-sown  perennial
14
ryegrass  swards.  More intensive  measurements  are being made on the 
swards  within a growth  analysis  framework;  animals  are being used to 
graze appropriate  treatments.
If a clear behavioural  pattern  could  be detailed  for a grass sward  when 
subjected  to contrasting  systems  of management  then perhaps  a best-fit 
management  system  could be devised  (i.e. optimum  defoliation  regime) 
or alternatively  it would  be possible  in any given situation  to predict  the 
deviation  from the ceiling  yield (under  optimal  defoliation  conditions).  To 
have real practical  value  it would  be necessary  to know  how much  growth  
actually  occurs  under  any particular  system  of grazing  management  and 
whether  herbage  production  changes  with changes  in stocking  rate.
Sward  parameters  need to be characterised  so that variation  in manage ­
ment  can be related  to plant  productivity.  It is necessary  to investigate  the 
method  of defoliation  employed  by the grazing  animal  in conjunction  
with the treading  effects  incurred  by the plant and to examine  their joint  
influence  on sward growth.  In addition  the length of interval  between  
successive  defoliations  has considerable  influence  on the rates at which  
leaves  senesce  and decompose.  When  this information  becomes  available  
it should  be possible  to define  the efficiencies  of cutting  and grazing  and to 
quantify  the relationship  between  animal  production,  plant growth  and 
utilization.  I would conclude  by suggesting  that it is only when the 
techniques  of applied  plant physiology  are integrated  into current  grass/  
animal production  experimentation  that definitive  answers  to the out­
standing  problems  in grassland  management  will be attained.

Why  Use Straw  in Beef Cattle  Diets?
by
P. J. CAFFREY
University  College,  Lyons,  Newcastle,  Co. Dublin
Before  attempting  to pursue  the question  posed  in the title, it is necessary 
to ask and hopefully  answer  the following  relevant  questions:
(a) Do we have a need for straw  as a diet?
(b) Do we have feeding  situations  suitable  for its use?
(c) Is straw  cheaper  than alternative  feeds?
Need
One of the major limitations  to increasing  beef production  in this 
country  is a shortage  of winter  feed. Indeed,  with present  stock numbers  
a severe winter  followed  by a late spring  often results  in serious  losses  
due to shortage  of feed. Under  these circumstances,  it seems  ironic  that 
much  of the straw  produced  in the country  is burned  or destroyed  in one 
way or another.  This straw,  if properly  supplemented,  would  be capable  
of over-wintering  up to a million  yearlings  or half a million  cows. While 
the provision  of high quality  hay and silage capable  of supporting  rapid  
liveweight  gains may be a desirable  goal, we must face the reality  that 
such material  is in short supply  and that much of the hay in the country  
is little better  than straw  in feeding  value.
In addition,  the judicious  use of straw in wintering  cattle  would  allow 
pastures  to be rested  during  the winter  thus ensuring  greater  productivity  
during  the subsequent  season.  Therefore,  more  extensive  use of straw  as a 
winter  feed would  enable  more cattle to be carried  all the year round.
Suitable  feeding  situations
In our pattern  of beef production  where  animals  are usually  2 years or 
more at slaughter,  there seems little justification  in feeding  expensive 
rations  to overwintering  yearling  cattle. Average  daily gains of ^ to f lb 
are usually  quite adequate  and such gains are easily obtained  on poor  
quality  roughage  (e.g. straw)  properly  supplemented.  This should  enable  
us to use our excellent  grass potential  to exploit  the phenomenon  known  
as ‘compensatory  growth ’. Compensatory  growth  refers to the ability  of 
animals  to respond  in term of increased  growth  when a high plane or 
nutrition  is introduced  following  a period  of under-feeding.  Most evidence 
would indicate  that if yearlings  are gaining  in the region of ^ to | lb. 
per day during  the winter they will ‘compensate ’ at grass compared
16
with comparable  animals  fed to achieve  greater  gains during  the winter.  
It should,  however,  be recognised  that the performances  indicated  are 
not adequate  in all cases e.g. feeding  replacement  heifers  intended  for 
mating  at 15 months  or perhaps  in animals  destined  for sale in the spring.  
It must also be stressed  that underfeeding  of calves  in the hope of gaining  
increased  growth  rate subsequently  is not recommended;  such underfed  
calves  are often at a permanent  disadvantage.
Another  area suitable  for the utilization  of poor quality  roughage  is in 
the feeding  of pregnant  cows. If beef production  based  on single  suckling  
becomes  more widespread  in the future,  there seems  every possibility  of 
devising  systems  whereby  intensive  cereal  growing  and grassland  would  be 
integrated  using high quality  grass and cereal grains for the calves and 
making  maximum  use of cereal  straw  for the breeding  stock.
Value  of straw
Nutritional  considerations : Straw  diets can only be justified  if they are 
cheaper  than alternative  diets.  Before  dealing  with  this aspect  it is necessary  
to look at the composition  and nutritive  value of straw (barley  straw is 
discussed  here but similar  considerations  apply to oat straw) and to 
decide on appropriate  supplementation.  In supplementation,  the aim 
should be to eliminate  specific  deficiencies.  Relative  to the animal ’s 
requirements  and to good quality  hay (which  is the alternative  diet dis­
cussed here) barley straw is deficient  in protein,  calcium,  phosphorus,  
energy  and probably  trace minerals  and vitamins  (see Table 1).
Table  1

It is often argued  that protein  is the primary  deficiency  and that a dual 
response  will result  from protein  supplementation :
(1) increasing  digestibility  as a result  of supplying  the rumen  bacteria  
with a nitrogen  source,  thus enabling  them to breakdown  fibre, 
and
(2) increased  intake, since digestibility  of roughages  is positively  
correlated  with voluntary  intake.
17
A survey  of the literature  reveals  that spectacular  responses  have on 
occasion  resulted  from protein  (nitrogen)  supplementation,  while in other  
cases results  have been disappointing.  Where  good responses  have been 
obtained  the roughages  in question  have been of low digestibility  due to 
inadequate  nitrogen  but of high potential  digestibility  given the optimum  
supplementation  (e.g. tropical  forages).  Where poor responses  (from 
nitrogen  supplementation)  have been obtained  the roughages  in question  
have usually  been of low potential  digestibility,  presumably  highly  lignified  
(e.g. some cereal  straws).
In an effort  to get information  on the effect of supplementation  on the 
feeding  value of barley straw, a trial was conducted  at Lyons Estate  
involving  four treatments —two based on conventional  concentrate  
supplements  and two using proprietary  urea supplements.  Results  of this 
trial are summarised  in Table  2.

The reasons  for the poor performance  with the urea supplements  (which  
were fed in accordance  with the suppliers  instructions)  will be discussed 
later, but a surprising  result was lack of response  from the 37% protein  
concentrate  as opposed  to the 16% protein  concentrate.  The level of 
dietary  crude protein  with the 16% crude protein  concentrate  was lower 
than is often considered  necessary  for maximum  fibre digestion  and 
voluntary  intake (A.R.C.  1965) and yet no apparent  response  resulted  
from feeding  the 37 % protein  concentrate.
A series of experiments  were therefore  undertaken  to investigate  the 
effect of protein  level on performance.  When concentrates  (based on
18
barley/soyabean  meal and ranging  in protein  from 9 to 29%)  were fed at 
a level of 3 lb per head daily,  in addition  to barley  straw  ad lib. to yearling  
cattle, the following  results  (Table  3) emerged  (for more detail see Lyons  
et al 1970).

As can be seen from Table 3, a 25% increase  in straw intake  resulted  
from increasing  the protein  level of the concentrate  from 9.0% to 13.6% 
but no further  increases  in straw intake occurred  with higher protein  
levels. Digestibility  was not materially  increased  by increasing  the protein  
content  of the supplement  beyond  13.6%  (LP) (Table  4).

‘Calculated  by difference,  assuming  digestibility  of 90% for concentrates.
It was concluded  that, under  the conditions  of this experiment,  energy  
rather  than protein  became  the limiting  factor  at the higher  protein  levels.  
It should  also be noted that straw digestibility  was not greatly  increased  
by protein  supplementation,  i.e. relative  to the unsupplemented  material.  
This latter consideration  probably  accounts  for the poor response  from  
the urea supplements  (Table  2). Urea contains  readily  available  nitrogen  
(precursor  of protein)  but is devoid  of energy  and is most useful  in diets
19
rich in soluble  carbohydrates  (e.g. cereals,  etc.) or roughages  of high 
potential  digestibility  but deficient  in protein.  Since the barley straw  
referred  to was not of high potential  digestibility,  one would  not expect  a 
great response  from urea in the absence  of some cereal  feeding.
Since the real justification  for imposing  stringent  dietary  regimes  on 
yearlings  during  the winter  is the expectation  of exploiting  their enhanced  
growth  potential  (compensatory  growth)  with ‘cheap ’ but high quality  
grass during  the subsequent  grazing  season,  consideration  of the data in 
the following  table (Table  5), which  summarises  the performance  of the 
cattle (referred  to in Table 3) during  the winter  and grazing  season,  is 
relevant.

Performance  at pasture  was, as expected,  extremely  good. Although  
the winter performance  obtained  (Table  5) was lower than the targets  
(|tof  Ib/day)  referred  to earlier it is of interest  that the performance  
achieved  here was consistent  with having  the animals  ready  for slaughter  
at around  2 years of age.
Economic  considerations
It is often convenient  to compare  feeds in terms  of their energy  content  
and apply monetary  values  accordingly.  For example,  let us suppose  an 
animal  requires  3.5 lb starch equivalent  daily for a particular  function.  
This can be supplied  by feeding  10 lb of the hay or 15 lb of the straw  
referred  to in Table  1. Thus,  the value  of straw  would  be roughly  two-thirds  
the value of good hay.
However,  a fallacy  in the above reasoning  is that it ignores  the important  
consideration  of voluntary  intake.  If an animal  consumes  10 lb of hay 
when fed hay ad lib., this same animal  is unlikely  to consume  more than 
7-8 lb straw  (if offered  straw  ad lib.) rather  than the 15 lb which  would  be 
required  to maintain  a similar  energy  intake.  In the author ’s view a more  
rational  approach  to the problem  is to determine  how much concentrate  
must be added to the straw to make it equivalent  to the hay. It would  
appear  that 5 parts of straw plus 2 parts of concentrates  would  replace  
7 parts of good hay in most feeding  situations.  Thus, the value of straw  
will depend  on the price  of hay and the price  of supplementary  concentrates.  
Table  6 illustrates  this relationship.

In general  terms  the data in Table  6 may be expressed  as:
Y = 1.4x-0.4z,  when 
Y=value of straw  (£/ton),  
x=price  of hay (£/ton),  and 
z= price of concentrate  (£/ton).
Of course,  this equation  is simplified  if we are using poor quality  hay in 
that hay and straw will be of equal value!
Poor quality  hay
With poor quality  hay (at least the one referred  to in Table  7), similar  
considerations  with respect  to energy/protein  ratios obtain  as with straw  
i.e. energy  becomes  limiting  at relatively  low dietary  protein  levels.  As can 
be seen from Table  7, the response  from protein  supplementation  was as 
great  with high protein  (high  quality)  hay as with low protein  (low quality)  
hay forming  the basal diet, thus suggesting  that protein  and energy  came  
into equilibrium  at a much lower  dietary  protein  level with the poor hay.

21
It should  be stated  that most of the difference  which  existed  at the end 
of this period had disappeared  by the end of the subsequent  grazing  
period  i.e. animals  fed on poor quality  hay ‘compensated ’ at grass.
Straw  in different  feeding  programmes
Probably  the most convenient  way of utilizing  straw would  be to use a 
‘straw balancer ’ to balance  straw in terms of essential  nutrients  and to 
feed additional  cereals  or cereal  replacements  (e.g. molasses  plus protein,  
swedes,  beet tops, etc.) to give the desired  level of performance.  The 
composition  and level of feeding  of the straw  balancer  will depend  on the 
type of cereal replacements  used. Table 8 gives the composition  of a 
‘straw  balancer ’ using  barley  as the supplementary  feed.

The choice of protein  concentrate  in straw balancer  is governed  by 
economic  considerations,  price per unit protein  being the determining  
factor. With increasing  protein  prices the possibility  of using urea to 
cheapen  the ration  deserves  consideration.  It is outside  the scope of this 
paper to discuss  the feeding  of urea. In general,  however,  urea should  
only be used in preference  to conventional  protein  when  economics  dictate;  
urea is unlikely  to be superior  in terms of animal  performance.  Urea is 
best utilized  in high energy  diets requiring  relatively  low levels of total 
crude  protein  (e.g. beef cattle  on high concentrate  diets).
The winter  feeding  programmes  outlined  in Table 9 may be taken as 
broad  recommendations  for specified  categories  of cattle.  In these,  expected 
barley  straw intake  (D.M.)  will be about 1.5% of body weight.
Comment  on diets
Programmes  A and B are intended  to exploit  compensatory  growth.  
With programme  A it is intended  that animals  will go through subsequent  
grazing  and winter fattening  periods  before being ready for slaughter  
while programme  B envisages  a minimum  of 10 weeks grazing  before  
slaughter.

Programme  C was included  for completeness  but every  effort  should  be 
made to replace  this in practice  by high quality  roughage.
The cow feeding  programmes  (D.E.)  should  ensure  normal  growth  and 
development  of calf and good reproduction  in the cows. Less concentrates  
may be used in certain  circumstances  (when the cow can draw on her 
reserves)  but these are unlikely  to be satisfactory  in protracted  feeding  
situations.
Good  quality  straw  can be a useful  feed in many  situations.  We should  
make  every  effort  to use it to supplement  and complement  good grassland  
management.

Sources  and Levels  of Proteins  
in Cattle  Feeds
by
T. M. BUTLER
The Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork
Proteins  are complex  compounds  found in all living tissues —animal,  
plant and bacterial.  The structural  units from which  proteins  are formed  
are nitrogenous  compounds  called amino acids. More than 20 amino  
acids  have been identified,  and various  combinations  of these are involved 
in the formation  of the several  different  proteins  found in living tissues.  
In addition  to nitrogen,  proteins  contain  carbon,  hydrogen  and oxygen.  
Sulphur  and phosphorus  are also constituents  of some proteins.
On average,  protein  contains  16% nitrogen.  When  feed-stuff's  are being 
chemically  analyzed,  the percentage  nitrogen  present  is multiplied  by 
100/16  to give the percentage  ‘crude  protein ’. The term ‘crude protein ’ is 
used since nitrogenous  substances  other than proteins,  e.g. nitrates,  urea,  
ammonia,  may contribute  to the result. To distinguish  the real protein  
content  of a feedstuff,  the ‘crude protein ’ value may be subdivided  into 
‘true protein ’ and ‘non-protein ’ nitrogenous  fractions.
Sources  of Protein
Dietary  protein  for cattle  may be supplied  by feeds of plant or animal  
origin. Commonly  used feed ingredients  and their protein  contents  are 
listed  in Table  1. In these  ingredients  and in most  cereal  seeds,  true protein  
constitutes  80 % to 90 % of the crude  protein.

Protein  Digestion
The ruminant  has a complex  digestive  system  in which  the stomach  is 
divided into four distinct compartments.  The largest compartment,  
known as the rumen,  is similar  to a large fermentation  chamber,  and 
becomes  functional  within  a few weeks  of birth. In the rumen,  protein  is 
both decomposed  and synthesized.  The presence  of rumen  microorganisms  
enables  the animal  to utilize simple nitrogenous  sources  to synthesize 
protein  which  can be digested  and absorbed.
Urea as a protein  source
One of the most commonly  used sources  of non-protein  nitrogen  is 
urea. Per pound  of digestible  protein  urea is considerably  cheaper  than 
any plant or animal  source  of protein.  With conventional  protein  feeds 
becoming  increasingly  expensive,  the use of urea as a cattle  feed ingredient  
is likely  to receive  much  more attention.
The addition  of urea to cereal-based  rations  can cause unpalatability,  
and over-ingestion  of urea may result  in ammonia  toxicity.  It is important  
that urea be combined  with palatable  feed ingredients  and to ensure  
thorough  mixing.  Sugar cane molasses,  a palatable  liquid  with a low crude  
protein  content,  makes  an ideal base for the addition  of urea.
A trial was designed  with Fresian  heifers  to determine  the effect of 
incorporating  1.0% and 2.0% urea in molasses  at the expense  of plant  
protein.  Twelve  animals  were randomly  assigned  to each of the three  
treatments  shown  in Table  2.

The digestible  protein  intakes  on each of the three treatments  were  
estimated  to be equal. Half the dally allowance  of 10 lb of molasses

morning,  and half in the afternoon.  Barley  straw was used as roughage.

during  the experimental  period  of 84 days.
The straw intakes  and liveweight  gains are showin  in Table 3. No 
concentrate  refusals  were recorded  after the first few days of the trial,  
and straw intakes  were similar  for the three groups.  The daily liveweight  
gains  were not significantly  different  (P>0.05).  This observation  indicates  
that the levels of urea used in treatments  2 and 3 were efficiently  utilized.

Blood samples  were taken from the jugular  vein of four animals  on 
each treatment  at 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours following  consumption  
of the morning  feed. These samples  were analyzed  for plasma  urea-  
nitrogen  content.  The results are presented  in Table 4. There was no 
evidence  of elevated  plasma  urea-nitrogen  due to the feeding  of urea at 
any of the three times of sampling.

Protein  Supplementation  of Silage
One of the advantages  claimed  for silage  harvested  at an early stage of 
growth  is a high crude protein  content.  The proportion  of the crude  
protein  present  as true protein  is dependent  on the material  ensiled  and
26
quality  of preservation.  The data in Table 5 show that the ratio of true 
protein  to crude protein  in silages  harvested  at different  stages  of growth  
can vary widely.

There  is a limit to the amount  of non-protein  nitrogen  that can be fed 
without  depressing  animal  performance.  Because  of the high proportion  
of non-protein  nitrogen  in some silages,  the importance  of a high crude  
protein  content  should  not be over-emphasized.  When deciding  on the 
source  and level of protein  to use in the concentrate  ration,  the protein  
composition  of the silage  should  be known.
Feeding  urea with silage —experiment  1
Ten Friesian  bullocks  of about 950 lb bodyweight  were assigned  to 
each of the following  two treatments  for a period  of 88 days:
(1) Restricted  silage  plus molasses-urea  mixture.*
(2) Restructed  silage plus 8 lb barley.
♦Percent composition:  Molasses,  90.5;  Urea,  2.5; Water,  5.0; Minerals  and Vitamins,  
2.0.
The daily silage allowance  was restricted  to 1 lb of silage dry matter  per 
100 lb bodyweight.  The animals  had access  to the molasses-urea  mixture  
for 8 hours per day. The animals  were group  fed and wintered  outdoors  
in acre-sized  paddocks.
The silage fed was poorly  preserved  (pH 5.2). The dry matter,  crude  
protein  and true protein  were 19.7, 14. 0 and 7.4%,  respectively.  During  
the first 41 days of the trial, the animals  on treatment  1 consumed  10.7 lb 
of molasses-urea  mixture  per day and lost 0.88 lb of bodyweight  per day. 
During  the same period,  the animals  on treatment  2 gained  0.50 lb per 
day. Both groups  were fed 45 lb of silage per day during  this time.
Because  the animals  on treatment  1 were rapidly  losing  bodyweight,  it 
was decided  to alter the treatment  after 41 days. To determine  whether  
there would  be a response  to feeding  a source  of true protein,  the animals  
on treatment  1 were fed 2 lb of soyabean  meal per day from days 42 to 
88. It is apparent  from Figure  1 that there was an immediate  and very
27
pronounced  response  to the feeding  of vegetable  protein.  The daily intake  
of molasses-urea  mixture  during  the period  42 to 88 days increased  to 
15.6 lb per animal,  and at the same time, the animals  in both groups  were  
being  fed 50 lb of silage  per day. During  this period  the animals  on treat ­
ment 1 gained  2.67 lb per day while  those in group 2 gained  1.90 lb per day.
Feeding  urea with silage —experiment  2
A trial was conducted  to compare  soyabean  meal and urea as protein

Friesian  bullocks,  weighing  about 560 lb were used for the trial. Ten 
animals  were randomly  assigned  to each of the four treatments  shown  in 
Table  6.

The daily silage allowance  was restricted  to 1.5 lb of silage dry matter  
per 100 lb bodyweight.  The animals  were individually  fed once daily and 
refusals  recorded  during  the experimental  period  of 91 days.
The silage  fed was of average  quality  (Table  7). The relatively  high pH 
indicates  poor preservation,  and the high acid detergent  fibre content  
shows  that the material  was harvested  at a mature  stage.

of this trial show that there was no benefit  from the addition  of urea to 
molasses  while there was a significant  response  (P <0.01)  to the addition  
of soyabean  meal. The bodyweight  gain on treatment  4 was significantly

Effect  of supplementary  protein  on milk production
A trial was conducted  to examine  the effects of feeding  concentrates  
with various  protein  contents  to lactating cows being  fed silage  ad libitum.
Forty-eight  Friesian  cows in early lactation  were used for the trial.  
From  date of calving,  the animals  were Individually  fed 11 lb per day of a 
15% crude  protein  ration  plus silage  ad libitum.  After  a minimum  period  
of 21 days post-calving,  the cows were blocked  into groups  of 4 according  
to calving  date and milk yield. One animal  from each of 12 such blocks 
was randomly  assigned  to each of the four treatments  shown  in Table 9.

increased  with increasing  dietary  protein.  Milk fat percentage  was not

and the protein percentage  on treatment  3 was significantly  higher  
(P <0.05)  than on treatment  2.
From these results  it is evident  that the protein  content  of the dairy  
concentrate  ration  can be of great importance.  This area of work needs 
to be continued  using different  levels of concentrate  feeding,  various  
quality  silages  and different  sources  of protein.
Summary
The quantity  and quality  of protein  required  in the ruminant  con­
centrate  ration  is dependent  on the quantity  and quality  of protein  in the 
roughage  being  fed. Because  of the high cost of plant and animal  protein  
feeds non-protein  nitrogen  will be used more extensively  in the future  to 
supply  some of the protein  requirements  of ruminants.  When properly  
used under the correct  feeding  conditions,  the incorporation  of urea in 
concentrate  feeds can result in a considerable  saving  for the farmer.  The 
use of urea in concentrates  fed to supplement  silage needs to be closely 
examined.

Supplementation  of Silage  with  
Protein  for Beef Cattle
by
MICHAEL  DRENNAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
In this country,  animals  for beef  are predominantly  wintered  on conserved  
grass in the form of hay or silage. Barley  and oaten straws  are also used 
as a feed to a small  extent.
In addition  to roughage,  an energy  supplement  may also be fed during  
the winter period. This will, however,  depend  on the quality of the 
roughage  fed and the proposed  time of sale for the animals.  The energy 
supplements  generally  fed are barley  and oaten grains  (rolled  or ground)  
and molassed  beet pulp. Root crops such as swedes  are also used to a 
small  extent.  These  energy  supplements  contain  approximately  ten percent  
crude protein  and the question  is often  asked  should  a high protein  supple ­
ment  such  as soya  bean or meat  and bone  meal  be included  with the energy 
supplement?  Because  protein  supplements  are more  expensive  than energy 
supplements,  they increase  the cost of the total ration. In addition,  if the 
ration  is purchased  already  mixed,  then a charge  is made  for mixing  which 
further  increases  its cost.
Why is protein  required?
Ruminants  have an advantage  over non-ruminants  in that the micro ­
flora present  in the rumen can utilize non-protein  nitrogen  sources  to 
synthesize  the protein  for their own bodies  which  can later be utilized  by 
the animal  when broken  down to amino  acids. However,  the extent  to 
which non-protein  nitrogen  can be utilized  as a source of protein  is 
limited  and depends  on the diet fed to the animal.
Protein  requirements
The protein  requirements  of beef animals  depend  mainly  on (a) the 
weight  or age of the animal  and (b) the rate of daily liveweight  gain (1). 
Table  1 shows  that as the weight  of the animal  increases  then the percentage  
of protein  required  in the diet declines.

At a given liveweight,  as the daily liveweight  gain increases  the per­
centage  protein  required  in the diet also increases  (Table  2).

A deficiency  of protein  is shown  through  decreased  feed intake  with a 
resultant  decline  in animal  performance.
Protein  supplements  for animals  fed silage
Using data on protein requirements  and percent  protein  in grass  
silages,  the level of crude protein  in silage is generally  adequate  to meet  
the requirements  of beef cattle when fed silage alone or with low to 
medium  levels of energy supplementation.  However,  in the limited  
number  of studies  where  protein  supplements  were evaluated  with grass  
silage,  responses  in terms  of animal  performance  were obtained  from the 
inclusion  of a protein  supplement  with the energy  supplement  (2 and 3). 
Thus, there may be some factor  causing  poor utilization  of the protein  in 
silage  such as low levels of specific  amino  acids. Extensive  changes  in the 
form of the herbage  nitrogen  when preserved  as silage  has been demons ­
trated  (4). It has also been shown  (5) that the failure  of preservation  affects 
principally  the basic amino  acids especially  lysine.
Studies  using both finishing  cattle and weanlings  were initiated  to 
obtain more information  on the feeding  of protein  supplements  with 
grass silage.
Fattening  cattle
Two experiments  were conducted  at Grange  in which  fattening  cattle  
were fed well-preserved  high quality  grass silage. In the first experiment  
Friesian  steers were fed 6.0 lb of supplementary  feed per head daily in 
addition  to silage for a period  of 99 days. The supplement  consisted  of 
molassed  beet pulp alone or mixed  with soya bean meal to give rations  
containing  approximately  9, 12, 15 or 18 percent  crude protein.  The
33
supplements  were fed in pelleted  form to groups  of ten animals.  The daily  
supplement  allowance  was given in one feed. The crude protein  levels of 
the four rations  obtained  by chemical  analysis  are shown  in Table  3.

The mean initial weight of the animals  was approximately  880 lb 
(Table  6). The daily liveweight  gains of the animals  fed supplement  4 were  
significantly  (P<0.05)  greater  than the gains of those ftd supplements  
1 and 2. All other  treatment  differences  failed to reach significance  at the 
five percent  level.

The mean carcass  gains of the two groups  receiving  supplements  1 and

7 and 20 lb more respectively  in terms of carcass  than their counterparts  
in groups  1 and 2.
In the second  experiment  five groups  of ten Friesian  steers were fed 
for a period  of 98 days. The treatments  were as follows :
Treatment  1 Silage  only
Treatment  2 Silage-l-5.0  lb beet pulp per head daily.
Treatment  3 Silage+5.0  lb beet pulp/soya  bean mixture  per head daily.
Treatment  4 Silage-I- 10.0 lb beet pulp per head daily.

All animals  were fed silage to appetite.  The supplement  was again fed 
in the form of pellets.  The molassed  beet pulp/soya  bean meal mixture  fed 
to treatments  3 and 5 consisted  of 75 percent  pulp and 25 percent  soya 
bean meal.
The molassed  beet pulp contained  10.0 percent  crude  protein  (Table  8). 
The corresponding  figure for the molassed  beet pulp/soya  bean meal 
mixture  was 21.5 percent.

supplement  was fed silage intake  was decreased  by 4.4 lb or 28 percent.  
Percentage  protein  in the supplement  did not have any effect on silage  
intake.
36
The mean initial weight of the animals  was approximately  880 lb 
(Table  11). The daily liveweight  gains  of those  fed silage  alone  was 1.89 lb. 
This again indicates  that the silages  fed were of high feeding  value.

Animals  fed a supplement  in addition  to silage  gained  significantly  faster  
than animals  fed silage alone. However,  there was no difference  in live- 
weight  gain between  any of the four groups  that were fed supplements.
At the start of the study  a representative  group  of animals  were slaugh ­
tered and their killing-out  percentages  were used to calculate  the initial  
carcass  weights  of the five experimental  groups.  All animals  were slaugh ­
tered at the end of the experiment  and their hot carcass  weights  were 
obtained  shortly  after slaughter  (Table  12). Due to differences  in killing- 
out percentages,  liveweight  gains were not a true reflection  of carcass  
gains. Those  fed a supplement  were, however,  again shown  to gain signi­
ficantly  faster  than animals  fed silage  only. Percent  protein  in the supple ­
ment  had no significant  effect  on carcass  gain at either  level of supplementn-  
tion. At the lower  level of supplementation  (5.0 lb of supplement  per head  
daily) a total of 485 lb of supplement  was fed to each animal  and this 
resulted  in the production  of an average  of 44 lb of extra carcass  above  
those fed silage  only.

Thus, 1 lb of extra  carcass  was produced  for each 11.0 lb of supplement  
fed. When an additional  5.0 lb of supplement  per day was fed 485 lb of
37
supplement  resulted  in the production  of 26 lb of extra carcass.  This gave 
an average  conversion  of 18.7 lb of supplement  per lb of carcass  at the 
high level of supplementation.
Using the production  data obtained  in experiment  2 some financial 
returns  to supplementation  were calculated  (Table  13).

*Pulp/soya  bean (Ratio  4:1) @ £36 per ton.
In order  to cover  the extra  cost of the ration,  a carcass  increase  of 8.6 lb 
per animal  is required.
To obtain  an economic  response  from the inclusion  of soya bean which 
is similar  to that achieved  when feeding  5.0 lb of beet pulp, a carcass  
increase  of 20.5 lb per animal  is necessary.
It is assumed  that 416 tons of silage is available  which  is sufficient  to 
feed one hundred  cattle for a period  of 98 days when silage only is fed. 
The carcass  (cold) gain per animal  is 86 lb which  at 25p per lb leaves  a 
total return of £2,150  for the hundred  animals.  By feeding  5.0 lb of 
molassed  beet pulp per animal  daily  the carrying capacity can  be increased  
to one hundred  and fourteen  animals  for a similar  period  of time. The 
carcass  (cold)  gain per animal  is now 129 lb which  at 25p per lb leaves  a 
total return  of £3,676.50  for the 114 animals.  The extra return  from the 
supplemented  group is therefore  £1,526.50.  The total requirement  of 
molassed  beet pulp for the supplemented  group is 24.68 tons which at 
£26 per ton costs £641.68.  Thus, the total profit  from supplementation  is 
£884.82.  This figure  would  be reduced  slightly  if the cost of extra housing  
is charged  and the interest  paid on the money  invested  in pulp and the 
extra animals  are taken into consideration.
In order  to illustrate the response  required  to make  protein supplementa ­
tion as attractive  economically  as was feeding  5.0 lb of beet pulp  per animal  
daily in experiment  2, the following  calculations  were made. The cost of 
beet pulp was again taken  at £26 per ton. The cost of a ration  containing
38
4 parts of pulp to 1 part of soya bean was taken  at £36 per ton. Therefore,  
in order  to cover  the increased  cost of the supplement  when it is fed at a 
level of 5.0 lb per head daily, the carcass  gain required  would  be 8.6 lb 
above that obtained  with pulp alone. To obtain  an economic  response  
similar  to that obtained  with pulp, the carcass  gain required  would be 
20.5 lb above  that obtained  with pulp alone  in the present  study.
In conclusion,  it may be stated  that inclusion  of a protein  supplement  
with beet pulp for fattening  cattle fed high quality  well preserved  silage  
could not be recommended  on the basis of the above  results.
Weanlings
Studies  at Grange  (6) have shown  that with weanlings  which  will be 
retained  for the following  grazing  season,  rates of gain of approximately  
0.5 to 1.5 lb per day should  be aimed  at during  their first winter.  The 
higher  gains  would  apply  to animals  that are lighter  at the start of winter.  
High quality  roughage  alone is adequate  to provide  those rates of gain.  
However,  if the roughage  fed is medium  or poor in quality  some form of 
supplementation  will be necessary  especially  with lighter  animals.  In these  
animals,  since responses  to supplementation  are good, the level of meal  
feeding  required  will generally  be low.
In two experiments  carried out with  weanlings  the silage  fed was medium  
to high  quality  and thus only low levels  of supplementation  were practised.  
In the first experiment,  two groups  of thirty Hereford  cross heifers  were 
fed either a supplement  of 2.0 lb of molassed  beet pulp per head daily  or a 
similar  quantity  of a pulp/soya  bean meal mixture.  The percent  crude  
protein  in the straight  pulp and the pulp/soya  mixture  was 9.5 and 12.0 
respectively.  As seen from Table 14 the silage  fed was of high quality  and 
was relatively  well preserved.

As in the previous  study, level of protein  in the supplement  had no 
effect on animal  performance  during  the 111 day experimental  period  
(Table  17).

optimal  Use of Genetic  Material  to 
Increase  Profit  in Beef Production
by
B. VISSAC
Head of Animal  Genetics  Department , National  Institute  of Agricultural  
R?search,  Jouy-en-Josas,  France
1. General  information  about  French  cattle  production  and animal  
populations
Before  discussing  the best methods  of using genetic  material  to increase 
profit  in beef production,  I will describe  briefly  the cattle populations  of 
France.  There  are about  22 million  cattle  in France;  11.5 million  cows are 
bred, representing  between  one-quarter  and one-third  of cattle in the 
Common  Market.  A little less than 50% of calves  born are used for veal 
production.  This is the largest  percentage,  with Denmark  and the Nether ­
lands in the Common  Market  countries.  Our veal production  represents  
around  50% of total veal production  in the whole Community.  This 
explains  why the ratio of carcass  weight  of slaughtered  cattle (veal and 
beef) divided  by the number  of cows reared each year is the lowest;  
134 kg compared  with more than 200 kg (180-260)  for almost  all other  
nations  in Western  Europe.  This is a paradox  because  our beef breeds  are 
generally  considered  the most suitable  for growth.
As far as beef production  is concerned  we produce  around  20 % of the 
overall production  in the Community  and intensive  beef production  
(cereals,  sugar beet pulp and corn silage)  is increasing  rapidly,  though  it 
still represents  only 25 % of our beef production,  cows excluded.  This is 
the consequence  of a double  evolution :
(a) increasing  slaughter  weight  of calves  in the veal production  area 
(small  veal production  farms  are replaced  by dairy farms  in this 
area) ;
(b) dimunition  of the slaughter  age and intensification  of feeding 
systems  in the beef areas.
42
We rear and fatten  our beef  on grass as in Ireland,  chiefly  in Normandy  
and Charolais  but this represents  a smaller  part of our beef production  
(40% of heifers,  young  bulls and beef slaughtered).
Our cattle population  may be represented  according  to type of herds  
and breeding  systems  as follows :
(a) Milking  herds (75% of population)  are located  chiefly in the 
north,  west and east. They are concentrating  more and more in 
Brittany  and Normandy  (4.5 m. A.I. in pure  breeding  with Friesian  
Normand  and Mountbeliard  bulls— the latter is our dairy  
Simmental  and has 0.5m. A.I.). Beef crossing  with Charolais  in 
milking  herds  is of most  interest  in western  areas  between  Brittany  
and Central  mountains.
(b) Suckling  herds (25%) of population  are reared in the Central  
mountains  and south  west. They are constituted  by dual-purpose  
or multiple  purpose  breeds  (milk,  draught,  meat, or draught  and 
meat)  or crossbred  females  bred  by beef  bulls  (Charolais, Limousin  
Blonde  d’Aquitaine).  There are 1.5 m. artificial  inseminations  
in these crossbred  herds. Our purebred  beef herds represent  
around  1 million  cows but here the use of A.I. is lower (50%),  
particularly  in Charolais  (30 %) ,than in the other  types of herds  
(75-80%).
The proportion  of purebred  or crossbred  dairy cows milked  or suckled 
is based  on their milking  abilities.  Beef  production  appears  as a by-product  
of dairy cattle selection.  As milk productivity  increases  milk production  
will come from a decreasing  number  of dairy cows. More and more less 
productive  females  (native,  dual purpose)  will be crossed  with beef bulls, 
milked  if their production  is sufficient,  not milked  if not.
First generation  Fj females— native  X beef, dairy  X beef—are more and 
more used in suckling  herds  (around  10% of cows and 50% of beef  cows  
in France  are classified  in undetermined  breeds).
2. Biological  basis for optimal  use of genetic  material  in beef production
(a) Efficiency  criteria
Profit  in beef production  depends  on characters  expressed  or influenced  
by the two biological  units (calf and  dam) that constitute  the economical  
unit of beef  production  during  one year of the cow ’s life cycle.
These calf and dam biological  characters  determine  the number  of 
animals  per cow bred and the quality  of animals  slaughtered.  An analysis  
of beef  production  efficiency  is presented  in this way (Figure  1). It appears  
that the number  of characters  is large; they differ from dam to calf and 
there may be some  antagonism  between  what we try to improve  in each —
43

the former  must have a small size (low maintenance  requirements),  the 
latter must express  a high growth  potential.  There would be a great  
advantage  in selecting  independently  these two groups  of characters  and, 
if possible,  in combining  dams like Jersey  with calves like Charolais.  If 
not, we can at least select  50 % of calf genes  independently  of those of the 
dam by using bulls proven  only on calf characters.
(b) Additive  effects  of genes  and general  combining  ability
Genetic  variation  for all these  characters  (dam and calf), is very large 
chiefly  between  breeds  and also, but to a lesser  extent,  within  breeds.  This 
is true for size, milk production,  % fat, % muscle,  fertility,  prolificacy. 
Further  there are many biological  antagonisms  between  dam and calf 
characteristics  (between  and within  breeds),  for example  muscle  growth
44
potential  in the calf is associated  with infertility^  calving  problems  and 
low milk production  in cows. It is difficult  to analyse  these antagonisms  
due to the problems  which arise in expressing  independently  dam and 
calf characters.  One can at least have a general  approach  in the same way 
by comparing  calf characteristics  between  different  size breeds  mated  with 
the same dam breed  (Friesian  for example).  In this way the paternal  value  
can be estimated.  Also, dam characteristics  from different  dam breeds  
can be compared,  all the dams involved  being mated  with the same bull. 
Thus,  the maternal  value  is obtained.  This approach  is being  adopted  with 
our cattle breeds —some  of them are used chiefly  for terminal  crossing  
(paternal  breed)  or in pure breeding  (synthetic  breed).  We have tried to 
classify  our French  beef breeds  in this way, using  field and research  data 
gathered  in France  during  the last 10 years. This is a rough approach,  
more accurate  for some breeds and characters  than for others. I shall  
consider  three groups  of breeds  in France :
(1) dairy  and dual purpose  breeds— Friesian,  Normand,  Brown  Swiss,  
Simmental  (dairy  and beef type) ;
(2) native  breeds— Salers,  Gascon,  Aubrac;
(3) beef breeds —Charolais,  Limousin,  Blonde  d’Aquitaine,  Maine-  
Anjou.
This classification  is conventional  and requires  some explanation  as to 
some expanding  breeds.  It appears  that Simmental  is never used in beef 
herds; it’s rarely the case for the Maine-Anjou  breed where cows are 
generally  milked  (Figure  2.)
French  data on comparisons  between  breeds  for beef production  are 
given in Figure  3. As far as paternal  value  is concerned  beef  breeds  prove  
to be the best for rate of growth  and percentage  of muscle  in the carcass.  
On the other hand, however,  some difficulties  occur for calving  ability,  
except  with the Limousin  breed,  due to the large  size at birth  of beef  breeds.
The picture  is quite different  for the maternal  value of these breeds.  
Their  fertility  (% of non return  in beef herds)  is intermediate  between  that 
of native  and dairy  breeds —only  the Limousin  breed seems  to have fertility  
close to that of native breeds.  Calving  ability of beef breeds is quite  
variable.  Charolais  and Maine-Anjou  cows, like cows from large size 
dual purpose  breeds  (Simmental,  Brown  Swiss)  are very poor calvers.  In 
contrast,  there are less calving  difficulties  with Limousin  and Blonde 
d’Aquitaine  cows which  are intermediate  between  native  and other dairy  
breeds.  Beef  cows are also poor milkers,  chiefly  Limousin  cows. Maternal  
ability  expressed  as weaning  weight  of calves  from different  dam breeds  
mated with the same sire breed is the consequence  of both growth  and 
dairy  genes.  This is the reason  why large dual purpose  breeds  (Simmental,  
Brown  Swiss)  give higher  weaning  weights  than beef  breeds  like Charolais,

Maine-Anjou  and especially  Limousin.  Females  of this last breed  give on 
the other  hand calves  having  the highest  weaning  score.
On the whole there is a marked  antagonism  between  paternal  and 
maternal  values,  i.e. between  calf and dam characters  of the breeds.  Thus,  
there is particular  interest  in knowing  and selecting  the best ones for each 
type of breeding —commercial  crossing,  pure breeding.  The results  point  
out general  and important  tendencies  between  breeds which are now 
popular  and perhaps  important  for future cross breeding  schemes  for 
beef production.
(c) Heterosis  effects
The importance  of heterosis  (hybrid  vigour)  effects on dam and calf 
characteristics  is small for each of them but the effects  combine  in their  
influence  on the overall  profit.  This overall  influence  can represent  between  
15 % and 20 % of this profit.
(d) Comparisons  of cross  breeding  schemes
Comparisons  have been made in different  countries  on cross-breeding  
schemes  using heterosis  effects  on calf and dam characters  and trying  to 
combine  dams  of maternal  breeds  and bulls of paternal  breeds.  I present  in
47
Figure  4 results  with a native  breed  from  the Pyrenees  mountains  considered  
as a maternal  breed  and two beef  breeds  (Charolais  and Blonde  d’Aquitaine  
as paternal  breeds.

(e) Conclusion
It is clear from these general  considerations  and experimental  results  
that two-step  crossing  is the best way of using our genetic  material  to 
increase  beef production.  Our problem  now is to know what are the best 
maternal  and paternal  sire breeds to achieve this general system  
from a dairy cow population.  This is the same problem  which was 
studied  in Clay Centre,  Nebraska,  U.S.A.,  starting  from a beef cow 
population —Aberdeen  Angus, Hereford.  The problems  are quite  
different  in the two cases according  to the differenee  of characteristics  
between  beef and dairy foundation  cows. After different  experiments  are 
carried  out in several  countries  one can think about a great number  of 
breeds  and genetic  types.
3. Selection  schemes  of French  beef breeds  for beef production
Selection  schemes  for bulls were developed  in France  from 1955-1960  
to obtain  and improve  paternal  lines as the first step, and more recently 
maternal  lines from our beef breeds.  These  schemes  operate  chiefly  under  
A.I. leadership  owing  to the large expansion  of A.I. in our dairy  and beef 
herds. I intend  to describe  briefly:
— the general  basis of these schemes;
— research  work to improve  their efficiency;
— the practical  situation  and organisation  of these schemes  now.
(a) Selection  schemes  of paternal  lines (terminal  crossing)
The basis of these schemes  as to selection  stage,  calf characters  selected,  
selection  intensity,  is described  in Figure  5. It looks like a horse race in 
three trials. In any year the animals  competing  for a given co-operative  
A.I. selection  unit are the 500 bull calves born each year from contract  
mating  between  a female  sample  of beef cows chosen  on their size and 
muscling  and three or four top bulls from the previous  generation.

At the beginning  (1955-1960)  these schemes  applied  on purebred  and 
registered  animals  (Charolais,  Limousin,  Blonde  d’Aquitaine).  It appears  
logically  that existing  breeds  and breeding  objectives  of herd book  associa ­
tions did not give the best genetic  material  for terminal  crossing.  Why in 
fact should  past and present  selection  together for dam and calf  characters  
give also the best animals for calf  characters alone?  In a first step (1962)  we 
used muscular  hypertrophied  bulls (Culard).  These  bulls, used in natural  
service  and not registered  by any herd book,  were competing  at this time 
with registered  normal  bulls. Many farmers  preferred  culard Charolais  
bulls for commercial  crossing.  The overall  advantage  of crossbred  calves
49
by culard  bulls proved  to be around  3.4% over crossbreds  from normal  
Charolais  bulls. Calving  difficulties  appeared  a little more frequently  as a 
result of the larger size and h,gher compacity  at birth of calves from  
culard  bulls.
So, in a second  step (1965-1970)  we decided  to produce  experimental  
crossbred  bulls, combining  complementary  characters  of French  beef 
breeds —Charolais,  Limousin,  Blonde  d’Aquitaine,  Maine-Anjou.  This 
was done in two ways :
(1) by MIDATEST,  which  is a union  of A.I. co-operative  centres  in 
the south west of France;  they crossed  top bulls of the previous  
schemes  (Charolais,  Limousin,  Blonde  d’Aquitaine)  with female 
progeny  of each other. This scheme  was not involved  at least at 
the beginning  of selection  with hypertophied  animals;
(2) by INRA,  our purpose  was to cross definitely  culard  dams and 
sires from the Charolais  and Maine-Anjou  breeds  on one side, 
from the Limousin  and Blonde  d’Aquitaine  on the other. We 
intended  to combine  the large muscle  growing  capacities  of the 
former  breeds  with the long legged and long bodied  well fitted
shape  of the latter ones.
These  are longterm  experiments.  All types  of crossbred  bulls  are progeny-  
tested and compared  with purebred  ones for terminal  crossing  on a 
Friesian  cow population.  We used also a control  line of bulls in several  
years for all French  A.I. selection  units —this permits  an efficient  and 
permanent  way of making  comparisons  between  all these  genetic  samples. 
We have little data yet and we cannot  see into the future  but my feeling  is 
that we shall need several  types of lines for terminal  crossing  according  to 
the calving  ability  of the female  population  (heifer  or adult  dams)  and to  the 
type of production —veal with white  meat or beef with red meat. Four to 
five lines perhaps  will be necessary  to meet these requirements  which  are 
in opposition  to a large extent.
(b) Selection  schemes  of maternal  lines 
These are experimental  schemes  developed  by A.I. units and more 
connected  in general with traditional  breeders.  Selection  stages and 
criteria  are described  in Figure  6. Less emphasis  is given in general  to 
calf characters.  We start also from contract  mating  but there are four 
selection  stages.  As to the selection  criteria  the original  points  considered  
or studied  were :
(1) measure  of pelvic  opening  during performance  test of young  bulls 
to achieve  a mass selection  on this character;
(2) progeny  test on farm on a large number  of progeny  to detect  low 
frequency  genes  like cleft-palate;
(3) progeny  test in station  on maternal  ability  (20 heifer  progeny  per 
bull recorded  from weaning  to 30 months) ;

Research  work is conducted  in several directions  to improve  the 
efficiency  of this scheme:
(1) we are trying  to select  a herd on twinning  ability— Charolais  and 
Maine-Anjou  seem to have a high twinning  rate (around  3 % on 
all cow population,  10% on adult  dams);
(2) we are studying  also genetic  differences  in the ovulation  rate after  
hormonal  treatment.  Artificial  control  of oestrus  is developing  
and will develop  more and more in beef herds.  It is necessary  to 
know accurately  the sensitivity  of each dam breed and line to 
P.M.S.

(c) Practical  organisation  and extension  of these schemes  
These  schemes  are carried  out according  to the regulations  included  in 
the law for breeding.  The most important  are indicated  in Figure  7. We

selected  for terminal  crossing  characteristics.
Conclusion
The evolution  of cattle breeding  in Ireland  is quite similar  to France.  
Further,  both countries  are now concerned  with the same meat demands:  
lean meat in the same Common  Market.  We have to develop  our beef 
breeding  programme  from the same Friesian  cow population,  using the
53
same beef and dual purpose  sire breeds  as paternal  or maternal  breeds. 
What  are the best ones for each purpose?  How do we select  them?  We are 
living in the period  of businessmen  and promoters  of exotic  breeds  but 
tomorrow  farmers  will ask not for red, white or yellow  traditional  beef 
breeds  but for the most profitable,  whatever  their coat colour.  New genetic 
combinations  between  existing  sire breeds  must be tested.  This is a new 
and exciting  but difficult  goal for technicians,  research  workers  and animal  
breeders.  Ireland,  France  and also Great  Britain  are particularly  ahead  in 
the use of crossbreeding  beef schemes  from the dairy herd. So it would  be 
natural  for these nations  to co-operate  in this way on an international  
basis.  It is clear  indeed  that the dimensions  of such  a programme in terms  of 
space,  time scale and money  involved  are largely  beyond  the capacities  of 
one nation  alone.  We have also much  to gain in comparing  and selecting 
paternal  and maternal  beef strains under different  environments  and 
production  schemes.  Irish schemes  are more  influenced  by use of grassland  
for beef  production.  In France  production  is more  limited  to veal and beef 
from corn silage and pelleted  diets. The beef breeding  interests  of both 
countries  are in the same direction.

Background  information  on the New Zealand  farming  scene  
New Zealand  has 43 million  acres of land of which  22 million  are in sown 
pasture,  13 million  in natural  grass, 1 million  acres planted,  2.7 million  
acres in native  bush and 4.2 million  acres unproductive.  The New Zealand  
population  is 2.7 million  people.  There  are 65,000  holdings  in New  Zealand  
of which two-thirds  are in the North  Island  and one-third  in the South  
Island.  An outline  of the farm size is presented  in Table 1 and includes  
holdings  larger  than 10 acres.
Table  1 
Farm  Size
Area of holdings  (acres) Percentage  of holdings  in each category
10-99  acres 24%
100-749  acres 61%
750-4,999  acres 14%
5,000  upwards 1%
Seventy-five  percent  of the productive  land in New Zealand  is devoted  
to sheep and beef and 10% to dairying.  Thirty-six  percent  of the 65,000  
holdings  are involved  in dairying,  44% in sheep, 6% in beef, 10% in 
cropping  and mixed  farming  and 4% in others.  The livestock  industry  is 
made up of 2.2 million  cows, total cattle 8.9 million;  breeding  ewes  
43 million,  total sheep  59 million;  total pigs 0.6 million.  The gross  farming  
income  based at farm gate values  for 1970/71  are presented  in Table 2.

Eighty-six  percent  of all New Zealand  exports  are agriculturally  based.  
Dairy  production for  1970/71  amounted  to; 229,000  tons of butter,  107,000  
tons of cheese, 123,000  tons of skim milk powder  and 55,000  tons of 
casein.
Milk processing  in New Zealand
A number  of dairy companies  were visited  on the tour but an outline  
of two of these will be given in the Report.  One is the New Zealand  
Dairy  Co. which  is the largest  processing  company  in New Zealand  and 
the second  company  was about one-tenth  the size of the New Zealand  
Dairy  Company,  known  as the Rangitaiki  Plains  Co-Op.  The New Zealand  
Dairy  Company  has approximately  5,900  suppliers  and each supplier  is a 
shareholder  in his company  and the amount  of money invested  as a 
shareholder  is related  to the amount  of milk supplied.  His voting  rights  
are dependent  on the number  of shares he holds in the company.  This 
means  that the people  who are supplying  the most milk and who have 
the largest amount  of money at stake in the dairy business  have the 
most  votes in the decisions  at voting  time in the Company.  The Company  
had a milk intake  of 358 million  gallons  of 4.76%  fat in 1972. Ninety-five 
percent  of this total  milk  intake  was collected  as whole  milk by the company  
tankers  and the remainder  was collected  as cream.  The Company  had a 
turnover  of £78 million  in 1972 and manufactured  225,000  tons of dairy  
produce  in 38 factories.  The company  manufactures  a large range of 
dairy products  which include  butter,  whey butter,  anhydrous  milk fat, 
cheese,  lactic  acid casein,  rennet  casein,  lactalbumin,  sodium  and calcium 
caseinates,  skim milk powder  (13 different  types),  whey powder,  butter ­
milk powder.  They also manufacture  mainly  for the South-East  Asia and 
Carribean  markets,  whole milk powder,  cocoa preparations,  a range of 
baby foods,  ice-cream  mix powder,  malted  milk powder  and condensed  
milk. The 5,900 suppliers  have 590,000  cows giving a herd averaee  of 
100 cows. The peak intake was 1.7 million  gallons  per day. This Dairy  
Company  has money  invested  in many  facets  of farming  operations  such 
as fertiliser  works,  computer  bureaux  and allied farm interests  such as 
meat packing  plants.  It is also involved  in coal-mining  and some of this 
coal is supplied  to the New Zealand  Dairy  Company  for operating  its own 
plants.  This particular  Dairy Company  is very large by Irish standards  
with an intake  of milk of 358 million  gallons  with 4.76%  fat and certainly  
is the largest  on the New Zealand  scene. This would appear  to be the 
maximum  size for efficient  control  and management.  Generally,  a company  
has units with an intake  of 50 million  gallons.
The Rangitaiki  Plains  Dairy  Company
This company  has about 550 suppliers  supplying  about 42 million 
gallons  of milk per annum  with a fat content  of 4.65%.  This company  
produced  over 26,000  tons of dairy  produce  in 1971/72,  including  butter,
56
roller powder,  sodium  caseinates,  acid casein,  spray skim milk powder,  
cheese  and some other milk products  including  a milk biscuit.  The peak  
intake  was 216,000  gallons  and the milk was processed  in 7 factories.  The 
dairy  company  has 16 road tankers  to collect  the milk from  their suppliers.  
These 16 tankers  are capable  of collecting  over 200,000  gallons  a day. The 
radius  of collection  is 35 miles  and the cost of collection  which  is borne  by 
the Dairy  Company  is 0.3p to collect  the milk and to supply  the bulk tank 
on a farm. Each trailer  is capable  of making  five collections  in one day. 
When the tanker  arrives  on the farm a milk sample  is taken each day. 
This sample  is analysed  at the laboratory  at the processing  plant and the 
analysis  is returned  to the farmer  at the next days collection.  The farmer  
is paid according  to pounds  of fat produced  and fat percentage  on the 
day of delivery.  One man tests and interprets  the records  for 450 suppliers.
The management  and committee  of this Dairy  Company  are very well 
aware  of the importance  of quality milk to enable  New Zealand  to compete  
in international  markets  in the future. Only by producing  high quality  
milk can the industry  compete  and sell dairy  products  on the world  market.  
At present  85 % of the milk produced  for the Dairy  Company  is at premier  
grade  and 13% is at the finest grade,  so less than 2% is of inferior  grade.  
This high grading  only came about by a well planned  and thought  out 
approach  to obtaining  quality  milk from dairy farmers.  First of all, a 
single skinned  tank with a refrigerated  base was made available  to all 
farmers.  This was paid for by the Co-Op.  The attitude  of most of the 
Dairy  Companies  in New Zealand  is that once milk leaves  the dairy cow 
it is the property  of the Company  and in general  they supply  the tanks  
and collect  the milk from the farm. Refrigerating  milk alone does not 
guarantee  quality  as was clearly  demonstrated  in this Dairy Company.  
They  initially  used the methylene  blue reductase  test as a standard  method  
for screening  milk but this had many  limitations.  Milk  kept in refrigerated  
tanks at 7°C will restrict  the growth  of lactic acid bacteria  but will not 
prevent  other bacteria  from growing.  To overcome  this problem  the 
nitrate  reductase  test (N.R.T.)  was introduced.  Under  the methylene  blue 
test 97% of the samples  graded  finest grade. The N.R.T.  showed  that 
86% of these were below  the required  standard.  Both tests are now used 
in combination.  Premium  grade involves  both a 5 hour methylene  blue 
test and a 5 hour N.R.T.  The main  features  of the milk quality  programme  
involved  an efficient  simple  farm refrigeration  system  for all milk suppliers,  
an effective  test to identify  milk quality  and an incentive  scheme  to induce  
farmers  to supply  quality  milk. The simple  single  skin refrigeration-based  
tanks  supplied  by the Company  are the following  sizes; 500 gallon  using  a 
1 h.p. motor;  600 gallon  using 1^ h.p. motor;  750 gallon  using a 2 h.p. 
motor  and 1,000 gallon  tank using a 3 h.p. motor.  As an example,  the 
actual  capital  coast to  the Company  for a 750 gallon  tank is approximately  
£650. Thus the cost works  out at £1 per gallon.
The Dairy Company  has a demonstration  farm which  is used to test
57
out available  knowledge  for intensive  dairy  farming.  The farm is run by a 
farm manager  and a milker.  The farm has 202 cows on 164 acres. The 
committee  of management  of the demonstration  farm includes  the farm  
manager,  5 prominent  dairy farmers  in the area, the Department  of 
Agriculture  adviser,  the New Zealand  Dairy Board adviser  for the area 
and a private  consultant  in the area plus the Chairman  of the Dairy  
Company  and the general  manager.  Close  co-operation  with the Department  
of Agriculture  adviser,  the Dairy  Board  adviser  and the private  consultant  
was in evidence  in many  places  throughout  New Zealand  and all of these 
advisers  worked  in close liason  with each other in their respective  areas.
An important  feature  of the various  Dairy Companies  was the high 
level of committment  by the farmer  members  of the Board.  The Chairman  
and other directors  of these companies  were very conversant  with the 
running  and management  and finance  of their own dairy  companies.  This 
was clearly  shown  by the Rangitaiki  Plains Dairy Company  where the 
Chairman  and General  Manager  made  a study  tour of 14 countries  in 1972 
to study production  techniques  and marketing  trends  in dairying  in the 
main production  and marketing  countries.  The farm directors  and 
Chairman  of the Dairy Companies  clearly indicated  that it was their  
business,  that managers  were their employees  and that farmers  made  most  
of the decisions  in very close consultation  with them.
Economic  position  of the farming  industry
The information  in this section  is based mainly  on a report by the 
Agricultural  Production  Council  of New Zealand,  May 1970.
Farm production  has increased  by 33% between  1960/61  and 1969/70,  
an annual  compound  rate of 3.2%.  The rate of increase  has been declining 
in recent  years. Dairy  cattle  numbers  rose by 26% between  1961 and 1970 
and beef cattle have increased  by 52%. Butter fat production  was 557 
million  pounds  in 1960/61  and 662 million  pounds  in 1969/70.  The price  
paid to dairy farmers  rose by 21 % between  1960/61 to 1969/70  but 
purchasing  power  declined  by 5%. The proportion  of dairy farms  in the 
low farm income group dropped  between  1964/65  and 1969/70.  An 
estimated  16% of dairy  farms  earned  a net farm income  of less than £1,000  
in 1969/70.  About  13% of dairy farmers  are estimated  to earn a net farm  
income  of more than £3,000  in 1969/70.
There has been a deterioration  in the economic  position  of farmers  
relative  to other sectors.  Because  of cost increases  and fall in the price of 
some  export  products, farmers  have  secured  very small  gains  from increases 
in production.  The scale of farming  has tended  to increase  to maintain  an 
adequate  family Income.  There  has been an increased  tendency  for the 
smaller  units to amalgamate  or be absorbed  into larger  units. Those  small 
units remaining  in the industry  do not, as a rule, have a heavy  debt load 
but their output  is no longer  capable  of providing  a reasonable  level of 
net income.
58
Due to poor  returns,  many  farmers  have attempted  to meet the situation  
by short-term  borrowing.  In some cases, this is because  their position  has 
precluded  long-term  borrowing,  and in other cases there is a reluctance  
to borrow  further.  As a result  maintenance  and development  expenditure  
have been restricted.  The long term solution  of these  problems  may require  
an extension  of financial  facilities.
Lending  to farmers
A committee  of enquiry  was set up to examine  lending  to farmers  and 
the main findings  are outlined  below.
In 1970,  agricultural produce and processing  agricultural goods  provided  
86% of the total value of New Zealand  exports.  Major  source  of finance  
for farm development  and increased  stock comes from farm profits.  
However,  incomes  have fallen and costs increased,  and some export  
prices have not increased.  Therefore  capital  expenditure  by farmers  has 
decreased.  With tow prices and uncertain  markets,  farmers  are slow to 
increase  indebtedness  as high farming  is no cure for low prices.  The total  
farm debt in New Zealand  increased  on average  by 107% between  1963 
and 1970,  from £6,000  per farm to £12,500  per farm.  However,  the increase  
in land value  has broadly  kept pace with this debt increase  and the relative  
debt burden  has not changed.  In 1971 the following  were the sources  of 
money available  for rural property  purchases:  Government  services  
provided  31.4%;  Insurance  companies,  8.4%; private sources  35.5%;  
banks 3.8%; building  societies,  3.6% and other sources,  17.3%.  These  
figures  show clearly  that the Government  lending  sources  known  as the 
State Advances  Corporation  which is similar to our A.C.C. provide  
approximately  one-third  of the money  for the purchase  price of land.  
Lending  from private  sources,  which may often be the father loaning  
money  to his son, accounts  for a further  third,  and the banking  organisa ­
tions loan less than 4% of the total money  for land purchase  which is 
quite a change  from the Irish scene.
Loan availability
The money for land purchase  was reasonably  available  in 1970/71  
when peak transfer  of rural freehold  properties  took place. However,  
difficulty  was experienced  in getting  adequate  finance  for young  farmers.  
The State  Advances  Corporation  (S.A.C.)  policy  is aimed  at the settlement  
of efficient,  trustworthy  young  farmers  on economic  units.
Land reconstruction
With reduced  profitability  due to increased  costs, some viable  farms a 
few years ago are now marginal  lands or uneconomic  units. In 1970/71  
60 % of dairy farms  had a net income  of less than £2,000.  In recent  years  
the S.A.C.  has increased  lending  for reconstruction  purposes.
In the past, profits  were re-invested  in farms  for development  purposes
59
in order  to increase  the productivity  of the farm. Due to falling  prices  and 
smaller  net incomes,  farmers  are investing  less of this money in re­
development  of the farm at the present  time.
Many farmers  are borrowing  short-term  money  at high interest  rates  
v/hen they need medium  term credit.  This, in some cases could mean the 
sale of the farm because'the  farmer  may not be in a position  to meet his 
committments.  The Report  suggests  that greater  advice  on farm financing 
should  be made  available  to the farming  community.  At present,  there are 
adequate  funds for stock purchase  but frequently  short term credit at 
high interest rates is used for plant  purchase  and this is not recommended.
The conclusions  of the Report on lending  to farmers  suggest  the 
following:
(1) There  is no evidence  that there is a shortage  of loan finance  for 
credit-worthy  borrowers  but difficulty  exists in the area of 
medium  term finance  for plant and stock purchase.
(2) Lack of profitability  in the farming  industry  is the major  cause  of 
farmers financial  problems  rather  than availability  of loan money.
i3) Farm lending  from the private  sector is falling  and additional  
investment  from Government  sources  will be required  to meet the 
needs  of the industry.
SOME  KEY FACTORS  IN NEW ZEALAND  DAIRY  FARMING
(a) The farmer
The dairy farmer  is technically  competent  in all aspects  of his farm  
business.  He has a positive  approach  to the solution  of problems.  He has 
shown clearly that he is capable  of borrowing  money for productive  
purposes  and most important  has met his repayment  committments.  He 
has one other  vital asset  in that he likes a challenge  and is a good  inovator.
(b) Farm  layout
Most roadways  range from 12 to 15 ft. wide and this is adequate  for 
herds up to 200 cows. It is important  when the road is being made that 
the crown  of the road is high to allow run-off.  For herds over 200 cows  
there is a suggestion  that the roadway  should  go up to 18 ft. and this 
appeared  adequate  for herds up to 400 cows.  A central  roadway  with well 
fenced  paddocks  was a common  feature  of all dairy herds. This allowed 
minimum  time for stock control.  There was no clearcut  decision  on the 
number  of paddocks  required  for a dairy herd but in general  for the 
smaller  herds, that is herds up to 100-120  cows, somewhere  between  16 
and 20 paddocks  were considered  adequate.  In some  of the larger  herds,  
that is 300-400  cows,  farmers  frequently  went for up to 56 paddocks.  This 
allowed  a morning  paddock  after milking  and also an evening  paddock  
when cows after the evening  milking  spent 12 hours in the paddock.  It 
was alleged  that the 12-hour  morning  and evening  paddocks  resulted  in
60
the cows returning  to the pastures  more quickly  and this was considered  
important  in the large herds. Otherwise  too much time would be taken  
up taking  herds  back to pasture.  The stocking  density  on paddocks  ranged  
from 70 to 100 cows per acre for a 24 hour period.
The general  approach  to grassland  management  was not to over-graze  
at any time and to allow sufficient  stubble  so that rapid recovery  of 
re-growth  could take place. The length of grazing  interval  varied and 
there  was quite  a controversy  as to what  this interval  should  be. At Ruakura  
Research  Centre  they were happy  that a 12-day  rotation  gave high yields  
whereas  at the Palmerstown  North  Grassland  Centre  they recommended  
intervals  of up to 40 days between  grazing.  This is mainly  during  the 
summer  periods.  The production  obtained  under both systems  was 
impressive  and the general  consensus  would  be that grazing  interval  is not 
that critical.  New Zealand  farmers  must allow grass to grow into the 
summer  season  in advance  so as to allow  feed to build up for the drought  
period  which  usually  occurs  during  the summer  months.  Furthermore,  the 
long intervals  are feasible  because  very little feed is taken  out for conserva ­
tion, particularly  in the first couple of months  of lactation.  Also, the 
condition  of the pastures  remains  in a vegetative  state for a longer  period  
than would occur under Irish conditions  due to the high influence  of 
clover  in the pastures.  Thus, less fibrous  material  occurs  during  the early  
part of the grazing  season.  The grassland  in New Zealand  can be affected 
by pests such as soldier  fly which results  in some of the grass species  
dying off. Sod-seeding  is commonly  practised  to drill seeds into the 
damaged  pasture.
The grass growth  pattern  in New Zealand  differs  from that found in 
Ireland.  We can grow as much  pasture  by using  nitrogen,  and grass  growth  
in early summer  is higher  here. New Zealand  farms grow grass during  
the winter  time when the minimum  growth  would  amount  to 10 lb dry 
matter  per acre per day. This would  be adequate  to support  one dry cow.
Water  is supplied  to all paddocks.  An important  feature  of the tanks  is 
that they have a fast flow ballcock,  which  ensures  that the tanks are full 
at all times.  Cows  spend  less time at the water  trough  and therefore  allow  
easy access  for a large number  of cows to drink from one tank.
(c) Milking  parlour  layouts
The important  feature  in siting a parlour  is that it is sited with good  
topography  and if possible  centrally  located  on the farm. There  should  be 
easy access  from the main roadway  to the milking  shed so that the tanker  
can have access  to the milking  parlour.  The tanker  road if possible  should  
be seperate  from the stock road, and a turning  circle of 70 ft. should  be 
provided  in front of the dairy so that the tanker  can enter and leave the 
farm without  any difficulty.  Other  features  of a suitable  site include  the 
availability  of electrical  current  and water  supplies.  An impressive  feature  
of all the sheds visited  in New Zealand  was their standard  of cleanliness.
61
This was achieved  by having  a good  yard washing  system.  For this, a good  
water  supply  and pump  are required.
Most  dairy farmers  used a power  washer  to wash the slurry  into a tank 
at the side of the collecting  yard. From  this tank water  was pumped  onto 
the pasture,  anything  from 500 to 1,000 yards from the milking  shed. At 
the end of the line was a simple  jet which  spread  the slurry  direct  from the 
milking  shed onto the pasture.
(d) Types  of milking  parlours
The herringbone  parlour  was the predominant  type of shed seen in 
New Zealand.  The sheds in general  were similar  to the open-sided  sheds  
that are presently  being installed  in this country.  The features  of these 
sheds  are : easy entry  for cows,  generally  by a circular  collecting  yard with 
a backing  gate and easy access  from the parlour  on the other  side. These 
sheds were so designed  that most of them had a motorised  backing  gate 
so that the man did not have to leave the pit to get cows into the shed.  
In addition  the man could operate  the exit gates from within  the shed, 
including  drafting  arrangements.  Thus, he spent maximum  time in the 
shed and could milk 100-120  cows on his own. A two-man  unit would  
have 14-16  units and this would  milk up to 200 cows. A number  of units  
seen were three man operations  handling  between  20-24  units. In general  
the three man unit would  only handle  20 units because  the time taken to 
get cows into and out of the shed was excessively  long with more than 20. 
This type of shed would  allow milking  of 300-350  cows and the present  
trends  for herds of this size would  be towards  rotary  parlours.
The rotary  turnstile  milking  shed is now being  installed  on a number  of 
farms in New Zealand.  They are a fairly recent  development  and more  
studies  are required  before  a good throughput  can be obtained  from  them.  
Their  output  per man is only equivalent  to that obtaining  in herringbone  
parlours.  These new rotary turnstile  sheds are being installed  only on 
farms with 200 cows and over. At present  a 17-unit  turnstile  would  be 
suitable  for herds up to 200 cows with a single  entry and exit. For herds  
that may expand  up to 250 and over, a 22-unit  single entry, single exit 
would  be installed.  For cow herds  over 300, a 28-unit  double  entry,  double  
exit would  be selected.
The advantages  of the herringbone  are its cost, ease of construction  
with farm labour,  easier maintenance,  adaptability  for extension  with an 
expanding  herd. The disadvantages  of the herringbone  are: more labour  
stress on the operator  and cows, and limitations  for use on the very large 
herds, that is, herds of 300 cows and upwards.  The advantages  of the 
rotary shed are: ease of operation  for labour  and less stress on cows.  
The future  developments  such as automatic  washing  of the cows on entry  
and cluster  removal  from the cows at end of milking  may be the possible 
developments  of the future which may improve  the performance  of the 
rotary  shed in terms  of output  of cows per man. The disadvantages  of the
62
rotary  shed are in that they are difficult  to expand  if insufficient  units are 
selected  during  the initial  installation  and also the high initial  cost.
The present  thinking  on collection  yards for dairy sheds is that the 
circular  yards are operating  well and would  be installed  for herds up to 
150 cows. For larger  herds, those from 150 cows upwards,  many of the 
Dairy Board  advisers  are now recommending  rectangular  yards  for these  
large herds as they reckon  there is somewhat  less stress and easier  entry  
into the shed with the rectangular  than with the circular  collecting  yard.
Milk tanks
The milk tanks on the New Zealand  dairy farms are standardised  for 
most dairy companies.  This offers a big advantage  in terms of available  
parts and in terms of cost of production.  The standard  tanks are single  
skin tanks. They are used on many farms  without  any refrigeration  but 
milk is pre-cooled  by a single  or two stage  cooler.  Recently  there  has been 
a tendency  to include  refrigerated  bases  to these  single  skin tanks  and milk 
is pre-cooled  before  entering  the tank. This may bring the temperature  
down  to 58 to 60°F and it is further  cooled  by the refrigerated  base down  
to 45°F. These  tanks are supplied,  and in most cases owned  by the dairy  
companies,  with a capital  cost to the dairy company  of approximately  £1 
per gallon.  Ownership  of the tanks by the dairy company  is important  
from the farmers  viewpoint  because  as he increases  his herd size the dairy  
company  will replace  his small tank with a large one.
The milk from these bulk tanks is collected  by the dairy company  and 
the driver  takes a sample  at the time the milk is collected.  The cost of this 
milk collection  scheme  to the dairy company  is about 0.3p per gallon.  
The New Zealand  dairy  companies  have an advantage  in that the average  
herd size is 100 cows so that large volumes  of milk are collected  from each 
farm and the radius  for collection  from the Co-op.  is generally  not more  
than 40-50  miles.
Why is New Zealand  a country  of large dairy herds?
The average  dairy  herd in New Zealand  at present  is 100 cows per herd.  
There  are a number  of reasons  why herds  have increased  rapidly  over the 
last 20 years. The milk price in 1971 was approximately  8.5p a gallon  in 
our terms.  The price of the calf was between  £8 and £10 and the value of 
the culled  cow was about  a quarter  of our value for culled  cows. Loans,  
which I outlined  previously,  must be repaid  and high output  is essential  
in order  to meet these  financial  committments.  In addition,  approximately  
49% of the milk produced  is produced  by share milkers.  These share  
milkers  are people  who are entering  the dairy  business  and who ultimately  
aim to own their own farms.  They borrow  a lot of money  and in order  to 
pay this they must milk a large number  of cows to meet their committ ­
ments.  Furthermore,  the New Zealand  farmer  does not treat farming  as a 
way of life, shown  by the fact that one farm in eight changed  hands in
63
1972. His ambition  is to have a standard  of living equivalent  to that of 
industrial  workers  in New Zealand.  Tough market  situations  face the 
New Zealand  farmer  at the present  time and he expects  to receive  less 
for his milk over the next couple  of years. Thus, he plans to overcome 
these difficulties  by increasing  present  herd size. Labour  on dairy farms  is 
difficult  to obtain  and is costly.  Farm workers  are paid between  £20 and 
£25 a week in addition  to their keep on the farm.
Animal  breeding  in New Zealand
New Zealand  milk production  is based primarily  on grass grazed  in 
situ with some conservation  of hay or silage and with practically  no 
concentrate  feeding.  On this cheap production  system  the New Zealand  
dairy farmer  has good yielding  cows with high fat tests. The high milk 
production  obtained  is due to grassland  management,  good  overall  feeding 
of the dairy cow, cow management  including  efficient  milking  techniques  
and disease  control.  But the primary  reason for high yields must be 
attributed  to the animal breeding  programme  controlled  by the New 
Zealand Dairy Board (N.Z.D.B.).  This body administers  the dairy  
industry  for the New Zealand  farmers.  The sire proving  scheme  began  in 
1961.
The scheme  is based  on an annual  intake  of 170-180  young  bulls which 
are carefully  selected  on the basis of the superior  progeny  test of their  
sires and grandsires  and the outstanding  production  of their dams. The 
young  bulls are bought  by the Animal  Breeding  Centre  when 7-9 months  
of age and cost approximately  £160  each. At one year of age they are used 
to inseminate  approximately  350 cows in order to obtain 50 daughters  
for a progeny  test. The bulls are then set aside until the results  of progeny  
tests are known.  This takes four years. Based on the results,  five or six 
bulls of the original  180 enter the breeding  programme.  These  top bulls are 
selected  primarily  on the basis of their production  rating but other  
considerations  such as anatomical  defects, temperament  and ease of 
milking  are considered.  The remaining  bulls of the original  180 not 
selected  are slaughtered.  The farmers  participating  in the sire proving  
programme  get free A.I. and in addition  are paid £7 for each heifer  used 
in the testing  programme.
The bulls are also performance  tested for growth  rate from 11 to 20 
months  of age. This performance  test is carried  out under commercial  
conditions.  Generally  the bulls are reared on pasture,  growth  rate is 
determined  and bulls are ranked  on the basis of their performance  over a 
9 month  period.  There are only two A.I. centres  for the whole of New 
Zealand  covering  the North  and South  Islands  and these centres  provide  
up to 30,000  inseminations  per day in the peak period.  Only proven  bulls 
are used except  for those being progeny  tested.  The number  of insemina ­
tions per bull is 50,000  for the season  and means  by which  this figure  may 
be increased  are being explored.  Fresh semen  is used except  during  the
64
peak demand  period  when 5 or 6 % of frozen  semen  may be used.
The Animal  Breeding  Centre does not organise  inseminations  but 
sells the semen  at 33p a straw  to the herd improvement  associations.  The 
price  of 33p a straw  includes  the cost of transport  to the various  association  
centres  and the price charged  is the same throughout  the country  irrespec ­
tive of distance  from the centre. The herd improvement  associations  
employ  their own technicians.  These technicians  are employed  for 7-8 
weeks  in the year  and are mainly  share  milkers  who carry  out inseminations  
after the morning  milkings.  They are trained  by the associations  and are 
licensed  by the Ministry  of Agriculture  and their performance  is checked  
annually.  During  their period  of employment  they are paid between  £25 
and £30 per week. The cost of getting  a cow in calf in New Zealand  is 
approximately  £1 to £1.25.
The work of the two Animal  Breeding  Centres  is guided  by a policy  
committee.  This committee  consists  of one member  for each of the 
6 herd improvement  associations,  one representative  from the Depart ­
ment of Agriculture,  one from the stud managers,  two members  from  
the New Zealand  Dairy Board and two members  from the pedigree 
breeders.  This broad based committee  ensures  that all facets of animal  
breeding  are represented.  It plans and guides  the animal  breeding  progr ­
amme  for New Zealand.
Share  milking
It is very evident  in New Zealand  that dairy farming  is a young  man ’s 
job and very few farmers  over 50 years of age milk cows. The system  by 
which  a farmer ’s son takes over the farm or the way in which  people  from  
outside  dairying  enter  farming  is of interest.  The system  is based  on what  
is known  as a share milking  agreement.  The share milking  involves  three  
categories :
(1) The 29% share milking  agreement.  The share milker  feeds, milks 
and manages  the cows but the owner  manages  and maintains  the 
farm. For the milking  and feeding  of the cows the share milker  
gets 29 % of the milk cheque.  This is paid by the Co-op.  and 71 % 
of the milk cheque  is sent to the owner.  This system  allows  people  
outside  farming  to commence  dairying  or allows  the farmer ’s son 
to obtain  a wage  which  is agreed  and is a legal binding  agreement.
(2) The second  share milking  arrangement  is on a 39% basis. The 
share milker  milks the cows, maintains  and manages  the farm.  
The owner has the land and the dairy cows. The share milker  
gets 39% of the milk cheque  and the owner  gets 61 %.
(3) This is known  as the 50-50 share milking  agreement.  The share  
milker  owns the herd but the farmer  owns the land. The share  
milker  manages  the farm and receives  50% of the milk cheque,  
between  50 and 100% of the value of calves and the full value
65
of culled cows. The owner provides  the land and the facilities 
on the farm and receives  50 % of the cheque.
A farmer ’s son starting  as a 29% share milker would accumulate  
sufficient  savings  to enable  him to become  a 50-50 share milker  in about  
5-6 years.  At that stage he would  either  buy a herd from the father  or buy 
a herd from outside  sources.  As a 50-50 share milker  it would  take him 
another  6-7 years to pay for the herd and to accumulate  some capital  by 
which  time he would then consider  buying  the father ’s farm or buying  
another  farm. Thus,  in 12-14  years,  somebody  starting  as a share milker  
on a 29% basis would  own a herd of cows and the land. He would  have 
paid for everything  except  the land. By this method  the father  does not 
hand over the land and the herd of cows directly  to the son ; the son buys 
them from the father  over a period  of years and the father  can then use 
the capital  to either  set up another  son in farming  or to provide  the father  
with an income  for his remaining  years. Once the son has bought  out the 
farm from the father  he may either  work on the farm with his son for a 
weekly  wage or he may have some land for rearing  replacement  stock,  or 
take a job outside  farming.  This system  of transfer  of land from father  to 
son overcomes  a lot of death  duty problems  in that the father  has handed  
over his assets  to his son by the time he is 50-55  years of age. This share  
milking  arrangement  also allows  people  outside  dairy  farming  and quite a 
number  of people  from the towns  to start as share milkers  and ultimately  
own their land. The actual percentage  distribution  between  the share  
milker  and the owner  is satisfactory  for New Zealand  but the percentages  
may have to change  in an Irish context.  However,  I think the principle  is 
a good one and should  be looked  at closely  in the Irish context.
Research
Agricultural  research in New Zealand is carried out by three  
organisations :
(1) The Research  Division  of the Department  of Agriculture;
(2) The Department  of Scientific  and Industrial  Research  which is 
responsible  for the Grasslands  Division  and the Dairy Research  
Institute;
(3) The Universities.
The Research  Division  of the Department  of Agriculture  undertakes  
research  into all aspects  of animal  production  and diseases,  plant produc ­
tion, soils research  and horticultural  research.
The importance  of grassland  in New Zealand  has resulted  in the setting  
up of a separate  section  in the D.S.I.R.  of a grasslands  division  which 
employs  approximately  50 research  workers  and has about  2,500 acres of 
land. Their  specific  function  is to examine  all aspects  of grassland  manage ­
ment and involves  research  on both lowland  and hill land development.  
The Dairy Research  Institute  which obtains  half its funds from the
66
D.S.I.R.  and half from the New Zealand  Dairy Board, which is the 
contribution  from the producer,  undertakes  research  into aspects  dealing  
with product  development.  It is divided  into three divisions.
(1) Fundamental  research;
(2) Applied  research;
(3) Servicing  division.
The research  workers  in the D.R.I.  are grouped  together  according  to 
product  rather  than on a discipline  basis. The D.R.I.  has a graduate  staff 
of 60 and a budget  of million.  Fifty percent  of the research  work is 
undertaken  at the request  of the New Zealand  Dairy Board or from  
individual  dairy  companies.  If a dairy  company  requests  a research  project  
to be undertaken  it pays on a consultancy  basis for the work carried  out, 
when  the results  of the research  are for the specific  use of that dairy  company  
However,  if the work is of general  benefit  to the industry  then there is no 
charge  to that dairy company.  At the present  time approximately  50% 
of the research  work  is on products  other  than butter  and cheese.  If a new 
product  is developed  the Dairy  Board  will fund resources  for the cost of 
the plant  and the test marketing of the product  for the dairy  company  who 
undertake  the manufacture  of the new product.  This is a very desirable  
feature  since the dairy companies  will then accept new products  and 
manufacture  them,  because  if the product  is not a success  they are not at a 
total loss since the Dairy  Board  will have funded  much  of the initial  cost.
Conclusions
The New Zealand  farmer  is a first class citizen  in the community.  The 
unity of purpose  of research  personnel,  food processing  units, servicing 
industries  and the farmer  as a producer  was impressive.  At the present  
time the New Zealanders  are facing a new challenge.  Much of their  
traditional  markets  are being eroded  with Britain ’s entry into the E.E.C.  
Farmers  accept this as a challenge  and must establish  new outlets  for 
their products.  They expect  they will have to accept  lower prices in the 
future  for some of their products.  Their  aim is to search  for new markets  
and produce,  process,  transport  and market  more efficiently.
Farm  lay out is excellent  and standard  features  are : simple  and efficient  
milking  and milk storage  facilities;  adequate  water supplies  with good  
yard washing  and effluent  disposal;  central  roadways  and water laid on 
to each paddock.  The farmer  has his milk collected  by his Co-op.  and is 
supplied  with a bulk tank at the expense  of the Co.op.  The N.Z.D.B.  
operates  a very efficient  animal  breeding  service  resulting  in well bred 
cows for the national  herd.

Pre and Post Calving  Feeding  
of Dairy  Cattle
by
P. A. GLEESON
Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork
Feeding  the dairy cow involves  a study of feed inputs  and milk outputs  
and an economic  evaluation  of this relationship.  From  an economic  point  
of view an optimal  milk production  is not always  equal to maximum  
production,  but will depend  on the price relationship  between  different  
feeds and milk. The farmer  must determine  the optimum  feed-to-milk  
relationship  for his system  of farming.  In the Irish context  this involves 
the maximum  use of grass  followed  by feeding  good quality  roughage  and 
judicious  concentrate  supplementation  during  the winter period.  Con­
centrates  are the expensive  feed input  and most attention  must be paid to 
the level  of this input. The  intake  of silage  is low relative  to the requirements  
of the lactating  cow therefore  some supplementary  concentrate  feeding  is 
required.  In this paper  the pre and post calving  feeding  levels for spring  
calving  cows will be discussed  in addition  to a comparison  of spring  and 
autumn  milk production.
Food utilisation
It is important  to understand  how food given  to the cow is used. Initially  
the cow uses food to maintain  herself  and additional  feed is used for 
either body gain, milk production  or growth  of the foetus.  This means  
that food eaten above  maintenance  is partitioned  between  milk and body  
gain. This partitioning  of food is influenced  by the level of feeding,  the 
milk potential  of the cow and the stage of lactation.
Pre-calving  feeding
The cow of good dairy merit is unable  to consume  sufficient  nutrients  
to meet her requirements  in early lactation.  The body condition  of the 
cow before  calving  is important  as body reserves  built up during  the dry 
period  can be utilised  to support  milk  production  in early  lactation.  During  
the last 6 to 8 weeks before  calving  the foetus is gaining  at a rate of 
approximately  0.8 lb per day; thus a cow would  need to gain at best that 
rate of gain to maintain  her body condition  and would  require  additional  
gain if she is in poor condition  at this period.  An experiment  was carried
68
out at Moorepark  in 1971 and 1972 to examine  the effects  of two levels  of 
feeding  before  calving  on liveweight  gain and subsequent  performance  
after calving.  Group  A was fed restricted  silage  in the last 8 weeks  before  
parturition  and group  B was fed silage  plus 8 lb of concentrates  per day 
during  the same period.  The cows were fed similarly  after calving  for 8 
weeks  indoors  and were run on pasture  as one group  for the remainder  of 
the lactation.  The silage dry matter  intakes  are presented  in Table 1 and 
bodyweight  changes  in Table 2. Silage  intakes  were higher  in 1972 than 
in 1971 and this resulted  in slightly  greater  gains in bodyweight  during  
that year.

The results  show that cows fed restricted  silage,  cut at the 7 week stage 
of growth,  will only maintain  their bodyweight  in the pre-calving  period.  
The cows fed concentrates  lost more bodyweight  after calving  than the 
silage  only group.  On going  to grass at 9 weeks  post partum  the cows fed 
silage  alone before  calving  gained  more weight  than the better  fed group.  
These  results  are similar  to those found  in many  experiments  reported  by 
Broster  (1) in his review  of pre-calving  feeding.
69
Weight  changes  at calving  are shown in Table 3. Weight  losses at 
calving  were similar  for the two feeding  levels except  for 1972 where  the 
8 lb group  had less weight  loss. It is not possible  to explain  the reason  for 
this difference.  The calf weights  were somewhat  higher  for the higher  fed 
pre-calving  group.

Milk yields  are presented  in Table  4. Pre-calving feeding  influenced  milk
yield inthe 1st eight  weeks  after  calving  and the pre-calving  feeding  effects
were still in evidence  during  the first 8 weeks  on pasture.

The response  to pre-calving  was greater  in 1972 than in 1971 because 
the cows were higher  yielding  and more uniform  in 1972. Although  the 
cows were fed the same after calving  the extra bodyweight  loss by the 
better  fed group  (Table  3), was used to support  milk production  in early  
lactation.  When  the cows went to grass the higher  fed group  did not gain 
as much weight  as the lower fed group and were able to produce  more  
milk during  their first period  on grass.
The higher pre-calving  feeding  increased  milk fat percent  during  the 
first 8 weeks  of lactation  but there was no difference  for the remainder  of 
the lactation.  Feeding  level did not influence  protein  content  of the milk.
70
The response  to concentrate  feeding  in pre-calving  period  is outlined  in 
Table 5. The concentrates  are costed  at £50 per ton.

The higher  feeding  level was totally  uneconomical  in 1971 and also 
during  the early part of the lactation  in 1972 but the carry-over  effect in 
1972 made the higher  pre-calving  more economical  when examined  over 
the full lactation.  In the experiment,  silage was restricted  and cows were 
getting  little more  than maintenance.  If cows  were fed silage  ad lib then  the 
response  to concentrate  feeding  would be less attractive  economically.  
For spring  calving  cows it would  appear  that concentrate  feeding  before  
calving  should not be necessary  provided  the cows are in good body  
condition  and being  fed good silage  ad libitum,  Broster  (1) summarises  the 
literature  by stating  that a cow in poor condition  in late pregnancy  will 
respond  in subsequent  milk yield to additional  feeding  before  calving;  a 
cow in moderate  condition  before  calving  responds  less well to additional  
feeding  at this period;  a cow in good condition  before  calving,  already  
well fed, will not respond  to additional  feeding  before  calving.
Post-calving  feeding
The cow after calving,  apart  from maintenance  function,  partitions  feed 
between  milk and body  reserves.  At low levels  of intake  body  reserves  are 
mobilized  to support  milk production.  As plane of nutrition  increases  
more of the feed requirements  for milk are met from the feed offered  and 
their  is a gradual change  from body depletion  to body  tissue accumulation.  
At very high feed intakes  the response  to extra  feeding  results  mainly  in an 
increase  in body reserves.  High  yielding  cows  direct more feed to milk than 
low yielding  animals.  There  is a need in most cases to have some body  
reserves  at the time of parturition  since  feed intake  is low after  calving  and 
increases  during  the lactation.
An experiment  at Moorepark  in 1971 and 1972 compared  three  feeding  
levels  namely  4, 8 and 16 lb of concentrates  with silage  in the first 8 weeks  
after calving.  The three groups  were run as one herd on pasture  for the 
remainder  of the lactation.  Feed intakes,  milk yields and bodyweight  
changes  are presented  in Tables  6, 7 and 8 respectively.

Increasing  concentrate  feeding  level from 8 to 16 lb depressed  silage  
intake  by about 18 percent  but little effect was found  between  the 4 and 
8 lb feeding  level. This effect on silage depression  would need to be 
considered  when the response  to extra concentrate  feeding  is being 
examined.
In both years of the experiment  increasing  concentrate  feeding  level 
resulted  in higher  milk yields  during  the 8 week feeding  period  and these 
differences  were still maintained  when the cows went to grass and con­
centrate  feeding  had ceased.  The carry-over  effects  were more marked  in 
1972 than in 1971 and could be accounted  for by better  cows in 1972. All 
cows lost weight  during  the first 8 weeks after calving  but weight  losses  
were reduced  as the level of concentrate  feeding  increased.
These  results show  that the cows  were  partitioning  the extra  concentrates  
between  milk production  and body reserves.  The cow with the greatest  
bodyweight  loss during  the first 8 weeks  of lactation  gained  more weight 
on grass than the better  fed groups  (Table  8), but this extra weight  gain

was attained  at the expense  of milk production.  Level of feeding  had no 
definite  effect on milk fat percent  but milk protein  was increased  during  
the first 8 weeks of the experiment  with increased  feeding  levels. Each  
additional  lb of concentrate  fed increased  milk protein  yield by approx ­
imately  0.03 lb. The response  to extra concentrate  feeding  is outlined  in 
Table  9 based  on concentrates  costing  £50 per ton. The response  between  
4 and 8 lb of concentrates  are generally  satisfactory  but in 1971 the carry ­
over effect of early lactation  feeding  is somewhat  disappointing.  The 
responses  to concentrate  feeding  are similar  to those  mentioned  in Broster ’s 
review  on post-calving  feeding  (2). The responses  obtained  between  8 and 
16 lb of concentrates  are poorer  than the lower feeding  level and would  
not be recommended  for creamery  milk production.  At present  prices  for 
milk, spring  calving  cows should  be fed up to 8 to 10 lb of concentrates  
with fairly good silage after calving  until they go to grass. It would be 
difficult  to justify higher feeding  levels in view of the rising prices of 
feedstuffs.  With spring  milk production  the aim should  be to maximise  
grass grazing  in situ, conserve  good quality  silage and supplement  silage  
with concentrates  rather  than substitute  concentrates  for silage.

Autumn  and spring  milk production
Approximately  80 percent  of cows  in Ireland  are spring  calving  and milk 
is used for processing.  The remaining  20 percent  are autumn  or winter  
calvers  and these supply  milk for liquid  consumption.  There has been a 
dramatic  increase  in milk production  for processing  recently  and this 
increase  is likely to continue.  This extra milk is putting  a severe  strain on 
the available  processing  facilities  during  the peak months  of production.  
This has resulted  in very heavy  investment  in new processing  facilities  in 
recent  times. Peak milk intake  in June is approximately  12 times greater  
than intakes  during the months  of December  and January  (3). It is 
important  to determine  if the pattern  of production  should  be changed  to 
even out the flow of milk during  the year and this must be based on an 
evaluation  of the costs of production  at farm level and an examination  of 
the savings  that might result from better utilisation  of the processing  
facilities.  An experiment  was undertaken  at the Agricultural  Institute  field 
station  at Ballyragget,  Co. Kilkenny  in 1970 to eompare  the costs of 
production  for autumn  and spring  calving  herds  and identify  the manage ­
ment techniques  required  for both production  systems.  The experiment  
involves  six autumn  and two spring  calving  herds. Each herd is a self 
contained  farmlet  providing  grazing  and silage for winter feed. The 
experimental  layout  is described  in Table 10. The autumn  calving  cows  
have a three month  calving  period,  August,  September  and October  with 
a mean calving  date around  September  15th. Concentrates  are fed to all 
calved  cows from October  1st until approximately  March  20th on a group  
basis.  The spring  herds  calve  in February,  March,  April  with  a mean  calving 
date around  March  15th. Concentrates  are fed to these  cows after calving 
until approximately  March  20th each year. Management  practices  are 
similar  for all herds except  that 20 percent  more of the autumn  farmlets  
are closed  for silage  to provide  extra  winter  feed. The experiment  is still in 
progress  but the results  to date will be presented.  The results  for the autumn  
herds are  presented  showing  the effects  of concentrate  feeding  and stocking  
rates separately  for ease of presentation.

The effect of level of concentrate  feeding  and stocking  rate for the 
autumn  calving  herds are presented  in Tables 11 and 12, respectively. 
Milk production  levels  for the spring  herds  are shown  in Table 13.

Increasing  concentrate  feeding  level from 4 to 8 lb per day increased  
milk production  in both years but the response  to the 12 lb feeding  level 
had little effect  on increasing  production  when both years are considered.  
As stocking  rate was increased  the yield per cow was reduced  but output  
per acre increased.  Milk production  was low for the 1970 spring  calving  
cows as the herd was composed  of mainly  young  cows and heifers.  Milk  
yields  for 1971 and 1972  were  satisfactory  and the difference  in yield  between  
autumn  and spring  calving  cows was no more than 50 gallons  per cow. 
The area of land required  for spring  and autumn  calvers  is similar  but 
20 percent  more area must be closed  for silage for the autumn  calvers.  
The response  to concentrate  feeding  at 12 lb per day was not reflected  in
75
increased  milk production  but in body condition  at intervals  during  the 
year. However,  the difference  in body condition  was non-existant  at the 
start of each lactation.  The concentrate  intakes  for the year were approx ­
imately  6, 12 and 18 cwt for the autumn  groups  fed 4, 8 and 12 lb of 
concentrates,  respectively.  The spring herds consumed  about H cwt of 
concentrates.  Milk protein  percent  was increased  by increasing  the con- 
concentrate  feeding  for the autumn  herds but was only apparent  during  
the winter  feeding  period.
Based on the available  information  to date, a comparison  of autumn  
and spring  milk production  based  on the 8 lb of concentrate  feeding  level 
and a stocking  rate of 1.0 cows per acre is outlined  in Table  14.

Fertiliser  application  is similar  for both autumn  and spring calving  
herds,  4 cwt Superphosphate (8 %), 2 cwt potash  and 6 cwt nitrogen  (26 ^). 
The autumn  herd is fed 12 cwt of concentrate  and H cwt for the spring  
herd at £50 per ton. The silage costs are higher  for the autumn  herd as 
more silage is required  for winter  feed. The milk output  is based on the 
autumn  calvers  yielding  50 gallon more per cow in the lactation.  If the 
price obtained  for spring  milk is 20p per gallon  then the price for autumn  
milk producing  herds would need to be 23.Ip on each gallon,  for the 
lactation  and this is the extra cost of production  mainly  due to extra  
concentrate  feeding.

to give a similar  income  as a spring  calving  herd.

No consideration  has been given  to the possible  difficulties  in organising  
autumn  calving  herds in terms of labour,  or the management  practices  
associated  with the system.  If autumn  calving  were to be adopted  on some  
herds  for manufacturing milk then  thought  should  be given  to organising  a 
system  whereby  calving  would  be confined  to 3 months  of the year and 
that milking  should  cease for 4-6 weeks  around  July to give the milkers  
a break  from the 365 routine  presently  used with winter  milk production.
The major question  remaining  to be answered  is to determine  the 
increased  processing  efficiency,  if any, resulting  from more  milk production  
during  the winter  period.  Would  the possible  saving  be sufficient  to pay 
the difference  in production  costs at farm level?  At the present  time some  
processing  units are encouraging  earlier  calving  in spring  time by paying
77
higher  prices  for milk in early spring.  This practice  increases  the intake  of 
milk in early spring but reduces  the quantity  in late autumn  without  
affecting  the peak intake  which  occurs  at the end of May or early June. 
Only  a substantial change  in calving  numbers  to the autumn  months would  
affect peak Intake but it is unlikely  that the processing  units would be 
prepared  to pay the differential  in production  associated  with autumn  
calving.

Milk Composition-  
Future  Requirements
by
J. A. F. ROOK
The Hannah  Research  Institute,  Ayr, Scotland
In the past, trade and marketing  policies  have resulted  in substantial  
imports  of milk products  into the United  Kingdom,  and milk production  
has been mainly for the liquid market.  Moreover,  the Sale of Milk  
Regulations,  introduced  initially  to prevent  adulteration,  have restricted  
liquid sales to milk “as it appears  from the cow”. As a consequence,  in 
the production  of milk particular  emphasis  has been given to meeting  the 
legal presumptive  limits  of 3.0 per cent fat and 8.5 per cent solids-not-fat  
and too little attention  has been given to the milk content  of individual  
constituents  and to their relative  importance.
Entry into the European  Economic  Community  has provided  the 
opportunity  for the marketing  of liquid milks of different,  defined  com­
positions  and a greater  use of milk for manufacturing  purposes,  and the 
market  for milk could  be further  developed  by exploiting  fully its role as a 
raw material  for the food and other  industries.  Within  this context,  much  
more importance  may be attached  to the detailed  composition  of milk.  
Changes  in the basis of payment  seem inevitable  and eventually  schemes 
may be introduced  which  take account,  not of volume  linked  to composi ­
tion but of yields  of constituents.
Recent  and probable  future  increases  in cereal  prices  will make  systems 
of milk production  based on grass even more economically  attractive  
than in the past and a more extensive  use of grass and grass products  
must be envisaged.  Grazing  enforces  relatively  simple  systems  of feeding  
management  and as long as grazing  is important,  the past emphasis  in 
commercial  practise  on the avoidance  of deficiencies  in composition  will 
continue.  Current  research  into digestion  in the rumen,  however,  offers  the 
prospect  of improving  considerably  the efficiency  of feed utilization  and of 
controlling  the quality  of animal  products.  There is increasing  evidence 
that rumen  fermentation  may be manipulated  through  the careful  control  
of the physical  and chemical  form of the diet and the standardisation  of
79
feeding  conditions,  to minimise  wasteful  aspects  of fermentation  and to 
give the optimum  mixture  of fermentation  products  for a particular  
productive  process.  If these possibilities  are realized,  it could prove  
economically  advantageous  to adopt highly  mechanised  systems  for the 
preparation  and provision  of feed; intensively  produced  grass would  no 
longer  be grazed  but used as a primary  raw material.  The potential  would  
then exist for producing  milks  for specific  markets  and a careful  definition  
of desirable  characteristics  and the means of achieving  them would be 
required.
Milk and its constituents
The following  is a brief  account  of the important  features  of milk as a 
food material  and the present  scope for controlling  or modifying  milk 
composition.
The importance  of milk in the human  diet is largely  in the protein,  
calcium,  riboflavin,  vitamin  A and thiamine  that it contains.  The relatively 
low levels of sulphur  amino acids in casein are complemented  by the 
higher  levels  in the whey proteins  and the mixed  proteins  of milk have an 
essential  amino  acid composition  that compares  favourably  with that of 
the F.A.O.  standard  (Table  1). Milk proteins  are especially  rich in lysine  
and are thus valuable  as a supplement  to cereal-based  diets which  tend to 
be low in lysine.

Milk fat is a rich source  of energy  but it is highly saturated  with a 
comparatively  high melting-point,  which  in some  circumstances  is held to 
be a marketing  limitation.  Also, milk fat is low in polyunsaturated  fatty  
acids (more so than human  milk fat—Table 2) and has been implicated  
in atherosclerosis  although  it is open to question  whether  the non- 
polyunsaturated  fatty acids of milk fat themselves  promote  the disease.

Milk sugar, lactose,  also serves as a source  of energy  and, as a dis­
accharide,  is unique  in that it contains  galactose,  an essential  constituent  
of nervous  tissue.  There  is, however,  no evidence  that galactose  is a dietary  
essential,  even in the young  animal.  Moreover,  intestinal  lactase  decreases  
after weaning  and in some populations,  more particularly  non-western  
ones, a high proportion  of adults  lack the ability  to digest  lactose  and the 
inclusion  of milk products  in the diet causes  diarrhoea  (Kretchmer,  1972).  
However,  lactose  may facilitate  the absorption  of dietary  calcium.
Apart from the nutritional  significance  of the individual  constituents,  
milk and milk products  have a unique  consumer  appeal  and this needs  to 
be recognized  and exploited  fully for marketing  purposes.
Factors  affecting  milk composition
Milk shows  wide natural  variations  in composition,  due to factors  such 
as breed, individual  physiological  variability,  age, nutrition,  stage of 
lactation  and udder  disease.
Breeding
Breed differences  in milk composition  are widely  recognised  but there  
is not as full an appreciation  of the differences  that can exist between  herds  
within a breed (Table 3) and between  individual  cows within a herd 
(Table  4). Improvement  in milk quality  through  breeding  is limited  by the 
heritability  of the various milk constituents,  the genetic correlations

between  them and the range  of genetic  variation.  Estimates  of heritability  
of fat, lactose,  and protein range  from  0.3 to 0.75, reflecting  the importance  
of environmental  factors  and the influence  of frequency  of sampling  on 
the assessment  of lactational  averages.  Genetic  improvement  would be 
facilitated  by the development  of indices  of genetic  potential.  The lactose  
to potassium  ratio has been proposed  as an index of lactose  potential  
(Walsh  & Rook, 1964) and there is some evidence  (Spooner,  Mazumder,  
Griffin,  Kingwill,  Wijeratne  & Wilson,  1973)  that high-yielding  herds  have 
an unusually  high proportion  of the heterozygous  form of amylase  I in 
blood serum (Mazumder  & Spooner,  1970). Comparable  studies for 
protein  and fat have not been reported.
Feeding
The effect  of feeding  has been studied  mainly  in experiments  of relatively 
short  duration  in the middle  of lactation.  The results  give a clear  indication  
of the nature and direction  of changes  but may underestimate  their  
magnitude  under  commercial  conditions.
Dietary  energy
The energy  intake  of the cow, which  is determined  both by the energy 
concentration  of the diet and the dry-matter  consumption,  has a major  
effect on milk composition.  With an increase  in the plane of energy 
nutrition,  protein  and solids-not-fat  contents  are increased  and there is

frequently  an opposite  change  in fat content.  In cows  advanced  in lactation,  
lactose  content  may also be affected.  Responses  to extra  energy  tend to be 
greater  at low than at high levels of feeding.  With an improvement  in the 
level of feeding  the rise in milk protein  (and solids-not-fat)  content  and 
the fall in fat content  are more  pronounced  when the ratio of concentrates  
to hay in the diet is also increased;  the effect is even more marked  if the 
nature  of the concentrates  is changed  such that they are rich in soluble 
starch.  Of the common  farm foods,  flaked  maize  has the highest  content of 
readily-soluble  starch.  Fine-grinding  of the forage  in the diet has a similar  
effect to reducing  its amount.  Under  the most favourable  experimental  
circumstances,  increases  in protein  content  in response  to an improvement  
in feeding  have been as large as 0.5 percentage  units, but increases  of 0.1 
to 0.2 percentage  units are more common  (Table  5).
The above  changes  in milk secretion  associated  with the amount  and 
composition  of dietary  carbohydrates  are known  to be due to changes  in 
the production  of the short-chain  fatty acids,  acetic,  propionic  and butyric,  
during  fermentation  in the rumen.  An increase  in the level of feeding  gives  
an overall  increase  in the production  of the acids but their relative  pro­
portions  vary with the composition  of the diet. In general,  the higher  the 
proportion  of concentrates  the lower the proportion  of acetic acid and 
the higher  the proportions  of propionic  and butyric  acids,  but the composi ­
tion of both the forage  and concentrate  parts of the diet are important.  
An increase  in ruminal  acetic acid production  gives a small increase  in 
milk fat content  and butyric  acid a larger increase,  whereas  with an 
increase  in propionic  acid production  fat content  is depressed  and protein  
(and therefore  solids-not-fat)  content  increased.
Seasonally,  the lowest level of fat content  occurs during the early  
grazing  period,  as young  succulent  grass, though  of high energy  content,  
lacks the physical  quality  of fibrousness.  A similar problem  is oecasionally  
reported  in the autumn,  in cows receiving  kale and supplementary  con­
centrates  only. These deficiencies  may be remedied  by offering  a small 
amount  of hay or other fibrous  material.
Solids-not-fat  content  is at a minimum  during  the period  from December  
to April,  and exceptionally  low values  are recorded  in certain  herds.  These 
low values  are in some instances  the result  of a high incidence  of mastitis  
which  depresses  milk lactose  content  (see later).  They  may also be attribut ­
able in part to underfeeding,  due to a shortage  in terms of either  quality  
or amount  in the bulky  forage  foods  and a failure  to provide  the necessary 
supplementary  concentrates.  Since forages  normally  account  for a large 
part of the diet at that time, substantial  improvements  in solids-not-fat  
and protein  contents  are not readily  achieved  simply  by improving  the 
level of concentrate  feeding;  improvements  need to be made  in the energy 
value of both the concentrates  and roughages  on offer. In practice  this 
means the solution  must be long-term,  through  the production  of the 
required  amounts  of good-quality,  conserved  foods.
84
Dietary  protein.
Increasing  the protein content  of the diet above normal standards  
(Bulletin  of the Ministry  of Agriculture,  Fisheries  and Food,  No. 48) has 
no beneficial  effect on milk yield or composition.  Decreasing  the protein  
content to 80% of normal  may depress  slightly  milk yield but has no effect  
on composition,  whereas  a more severe reduction,  to 60%, has been 
reported  to decrease  solids-not-fat  content  also (see Rook, 1971).
Dietary  fat
A certain  amount  of fat, about  3 to 4 per cent of the concentrate  part 
of the diet, is necessary  for maximum  milk and fat yields  but the amount  of 
fat in the diet has no consistent  effect on milk fat content  although  the 
composition  of dietary  fat influences  both milk fat content  and composi ­
tion. It is well known  that dietary  additions  of cod liver oil and certain  
other  highly  unsaturated  oils may cause  a severe  depression  in fat content,  
and a slight depression  in fat content  has been reported  with diets con­
taining  6 to 10 per cent cottonseed  oil in the concentrate  mixture.  An 
interesting  example  of the effect of dietary  fat on milk fat composition  is 
the comparative  effects  of giving  fats rich in either  palmitic  or stearic acids. 
Both are long-chain,  saturated  acids but the former  gives a milk fat of 
high melting  point, the latter one of low melting  point. This difference 
reflects  the fact that stearic acid, but not palmitic  acid, is extensively 
desaturated  in the mammary  gland,  causing  an increase  in the correspond ­
ing mono-unsaturated  acid in milk fat (Table 6). Dietary  unsaturated  
fatty acids are hydrogenated  in the rumen  but the inclusion  in the diet of 
protected  fats rich in polyunsaturated  fatty acids increases  considerably  
the polyunsaturated  fatty acid content  of milk fat (Table  7).

Udder  disease  (mastitis)
Mastitis  can have a profound  effect on milk composition,  particularly  
lactose  content,  but there has been much uncertainty  expressed  as to its 
importance  as a cause of compositional  deficiencies  in commercial  herds.  
Dawson  (1971) has recently  completed  an investigation  of lactose  deficiency  
in commercial  milk supplies  in the West Riding  of Yorkshire  and the 
extent  of observed  differences  in cell count  and milk composition  between 
infected  and uninfected  quarters  is shown  in Table 8. The depressions  in 
the milk lactose content  of the bulk milks of six commercial  herds  
attributable  to interquarter  differences  ranged  from  0.05 to 0.20 percentage  
units.  In a later  part of the same  study,  two herds  were  subjected  to remedial  
treatment  of an improved  milking  hygiene  and rigorous  antibiotic  therapy  
in association  with improved  feeding.  The calculated  response  in milk 
lactose  content  of the bulk milk was +0.096  +0.043  percentage  units  
(P<0.05)  in one herd and +0.243 ±0.050  percentage  units (P<0.001)  
in the other.

Conclusions
The legal  and marketing  arrangements  in the United  Kingdom  emphasize  
3.0 per cent fat and 8.5 per cent solids-not-fat  as compositional  standards  
for milk production  and this has stimulated  considerable  research  into 
the occurrence  of deficiencies  in fat and solids-not-fat  content  of com­
mercial  milk supplies  and possible  remedial  measures.  Changing  conditions

market pressures  from other sectors of the food industry  may focus  
attention  on detailed  composition  and bring changes  in the system of 
payment  which emphasize  the yields of individual  constituents.  Future  
research  effort should  anticipate  such changes  and increasingly  be con­
cerned with the efficient  production  of milk constituents  important  in 
nutritional  or marketing  terms.

SOME  IMPLICATIONS  OF DIFFERENT  SOIL TYPES  IN THE  
NUTRITION  OF GRASSES
by
K. HANLEY
Agricultural  Institute,  Johnstown  Castle,  Wexford
There are two important  soil chemical  factors affecting  the use and 
efficiency  of fertilizer  phosphorus  for grassland ;
(1) the native  soil phosphorus  reserves;
(2) the residual  or carry-over  effects  of previous  dressings.
The National  Soil Survey  has, in recent years, catalogued  Irish soils 
into 31 categories  or soil associations.  Analyses  of 500 soil samples  from  
these soil associations  showed considerable  variation  in native soil 
phosphorus.  Degraded  Grey Brown  Podzolics,  especially  in the Galway-  
Roscommon  area, were lowest  and the Elton-type  soils of Co. Limerick  
were highest.  The soil difference  was at least two-fold.  During  cropping  
with ryegrass  and clover an eight-fold  difference  in dry-matter  output  
was noted between  these soils, without  fertilizer  phosphorus.
Large differences  were also noted in dry-matter  output  of grass when 
24 of the major  soils were treated  with superphosphate.  Fertilizer  phos ­
phorus  was least efficient  on the acid brown  earths  of Wexford  and Louth  
(Clonroche-type),  due to the large amounts  of iron and aluminium  in 
these soils. Fertilizer  efficiency  was highest  on the more neutral  grey-  
brown podzolic  soils on gravelly  glacial drift covering  large areas of 
Offaly,  Laois and Kildare.

THE MEASUREMENT  OF NITROGEN  FIXATION  BY WHITE  
CLOVER  UNDER  FIELD  CONDITIONS
by
C. L. MASTERSON  and P. M. MURPHY  
Agricultural  Institute,  Johnstown  Castle,  Wexford
In recent years biochemical  studies  on nitrogenase,  the nitrogen  fixing  
enzyme  in natural  systems,  revealed  that this enzyme  is a very versatile 
catalyst,  reducing  several  triple bonded  substrates  other than nitrogen.  
One of these  reactions, the reduction  of acetylene  to ethylene,  has provided  
a particularly  suitable  method  for measuring  nitrogenase  activity,  which 
because  of its speed,  simplicity,  cheapness  and sensitivity,  is now universally  
used  to monitor  nitrogen  fixation  in ecological  studies.  Using  this technique  
the pattern  and amount  of nitrogen fixed by white  clover  in grazed  swards^  
including  the effects  of various  environmental  and management  factors,  
have been studied.
In 1971 fixation  remained  at a very low rate until late February  when 
it commenced  to rise. The increase  continued  until mid-summer  when a 
sharp decrease  coinciding  with  flowering  was observed.  A second  peak  was 
obtained  after flowering  after which  activity  decreased  to the low winter  
level, about  early November.  In 1972, the pattern  was similar  until mid- 
April, but thereafter  much lower rates were observed.  This is attributed  
to lower  temperatures.
The quantities  of nitrogen  fixed in four Wexford  soils in 1972 were 
Johnstown  Castle 140 lb (230 lb in 1971) Macamore  77 lb, Rathangan  
98 lb, Clonroche  113 lb and Screen  58 lb.
Fixation  increases  linearly  with temperature  until 20° is reached.  There  
is then a broad  peak and activity  declines  over 27°. Activity  is significantly 
correlated  with  soil and air temperatures,  hours  of sunshine,  and appearance  
of new nodules.  Fertiliser  nitrogen  in the spring  decreases  activity  almost  
at once and the effect remains  throughout  the season.  There  is a diurnal  
effect  due to temperature,  but overnight  darkness  has no effect. Fixation  
is severely  decreased  by defoliation and the rapidity  of recovery  depends  on 
the degree  of defoliation.

SUPPLEMENTATION  OF SILAGE  FOR FATTENING  STORE
LAMBS
by
P. T. MULLALLY  and P. J. CAFFREY  
University  College,  Lyons,  Newcastle  P.O., Co. Dublin
The use of silage in the diet of growing  fattening  lambs  was examined  in 
two trials, a feeding  trial on a production  scale in Co. Wicklow  and a 
metabolism  trial at University  College,  Lyons.
270 Wicklow  Cheviot  lambs (6-7 months  old) in moderate  store  
condition  and ranging  in weight  from 22 to 35 kg. were divided  into three  
groups  and allocated  to the following  treatments;
(a) Silage  ad //(>. +300  g concentrate  per head per day;
(b) Silage  ad lib. +150  g concentrate  per head per day ;
(c) Silage  ad lib. only.
Within  each treatment  the lambs were divided  into blocks  according  to 
weight.  The meal fed consisted  of barley  50%, beet pulp 40% and soya 
beans 10%.
The above  treatments  were applied  for 10 weeks  after which  all lambs  
received  a similar  diet—silage ad lib. and 600 g. meal per head per day. 
During  the initial 10-week  period  the lambs on Treatment  A increased  
weight  slightly,  those on Treatment  B maintained  weight  and those on 
Treatment  C lost slightly.  Concentrate  feeding  had no effect on silage  
intake.  Silage  intake  per unit of metabolic  weight  was generally  higher  for 
the lighter  animals  and corresponding  rate of liveweight  increase  was also 
higher. During  the subsequent  seven-week  period when feeding  was 
increased  all lambs  gained  weight,  those which  had been on Treatment  B 
reached  the same liveweight  as those which  had been on Treatment  A and 
those  which  had been on Treatment  C being  slightly  less. Final liveweights  
were (a) 36.8 kg., (b) 36.6 kg., (c) 35.1 kg. Silage  intake  was reduced  when  
the extra 300 g. meal was fed.
In the metabolism  trial silage was fed (a) alone,  (b) with 60 g. Sodium  
bicarbonate  and (c) with both 60 g. Sodium  bicarbonate  and 300 g. starch  
to eight  40 kg. Suffolk  cross  wether  lambs  (10-12  months  old ’ on a blanced  
latin square  design  on (1) an lib. basis and (2) to eight similar  Iambs 
on a restricted  basis.
Measurements  were taken for silage intake, silage digestibility  and 
nitrogen  retention.  Sodium  bicarbonate  did not affect significantly  any 
parameter  on the ad lib. diet but increased  nitrogen  retention  on the 
restricted  diet.
Starch  reduced  silage dry matter  intake  and digestibility  but increased  
nitrogen  retention  on both ad lib. and restricted  feeding.  The combination  
of sodium  bicarbonate  and starch had an associative  effect in increasing  
nitrogen  retention  on the restricted  diet.

A COMPARISON  OF THE EFFECTS  OF DIETARY  ACIDS  
ON CATTLE  AND SHEEP
. by
D. J. MORGAN  and J. L. UESTRANGE  
Department  of Agricultural  Chemistry,  University  College,  Dublin
The effects  of hydrochloric  acid (HCl)  and lactic acid upon food intake  
and metabolism  of sheep and cattle were compared  in a double  5x5 
Latin square  design  experiment.  The acids were given by addition  to a 
basal diet of pelleted  grassmeal  fed to five Jersey cross steers and five 
Wicklow  wethers.  Each acid was included  at two levels: lactic acid at 
500 and 700 mEq/kg  dry matter  and HCl at 300 and 500 mEq/kg  dry 
matter,  giving  dietary  pH’s of 4.2, 4.0, 4.4 and 3.8 respectively.
Cattle  feed intakes  were 96.6 and 93.4 per cent of control  for the low 
and high levels  of lactic  acid addition  and 78.6 and 66.2 per cent of control  
for the low and high levels of HCl. For sheep the corresponding  intakes  
were 94.2, 86.7, 87.0 and 71.4 percent  of control.  There  was no significant 
interaction  between  species  and diet.
Treatments  did not affect rumen  pH. However  there were significant 
effects  upon  total concentrations  and molar  percentages  of rumen  volatile  
fatty acids. Blood pH and Plasma  COg were significantly  depressed  in 
both species  by the HCl treatments.  Lactic acid caused  no significant 
depression  of blood  pH but plasma  COj in sheep  was significantly  depressed  
at the high level of lactic acid addition.  These effects  were discussed  in 
relation  to the values  for food intake.

EFFECTS  OF PERIODS  OF RESTRICTED  GROWTH  ON 
SUBSEQUENT  PERFORMANCE  OF CATTLE  FOR BEEF
by
M. DRENNAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
Numerous  studies  have shown  that animals  exhibit  a remarkable  capacity  
for growth  following  periods  of underfeeding.  This event was termed  
“compensatory  growth ” by Bohman  (1955).  Wilson  & Osbourne  (1960)  
pointed  out that the ability  of an animal  to recover  from undernutrition  
can vary considerably.  The present  investigation  was carried  out with 
spring  born calves  to determine  the effects of plane of nutrition  during  
the calf stage (first 8 months  of life) and during  their first winter  (8 to 
13 months  of age) on subsequent  performance.
During  the calf stage, moderate  and low planes of nutrition  were 
provided  which resulted  in daily liveweight  gains of 1.45 and 1.10 lb, 
respectively.  In their first winter  groups  of moderate  and low plane  calves 
were fed either  silage  alone  or silage  plus 5.0 lb of rolled  barley  per head  
daily. All animals  were subsequently  treated  alike until slaughtered  at 
approximately  two years old.
Both groups  of animals  fed silage only in winter  gained  0.55 lb daily. 
Consequently,  the moderate  plane  calves  retained  their weight  advantage  
during  their first winter  and, in fact, did so right through  to slaughter.
Moderate  and low plane  calves  gave similar  responses  to supplementa ­
tion (1 lb liveweight:  4.3 lb barley).  However,  only one-third  of the live- 
weight  advantage  obtained  from feeding  barley  to moderate  plane  calves 
was present  at slaughter  compared  with two-thirds  for the low plane  
calves. Feeding  745 lb of barley during  the first winter  resulted  in the 
production  of 35 and 66 lb of extra  carcass  with  animals  reared  on moderate  
and low planes,  respectively.

A COMPARISON  OF BREEDS  FOR THE PRODUCTION  OF 
STORES  AND CARCASS  BEEF
by
T. RAFTERY  and S. O’DONOVAN  
Department  of Dairy  Husbandry,  University  College,  Cork
Friesian,  Hereford  X Friesian  and Hereford  X Shorthorn  calves purchased  
at livestock  marts in Munster  in spring 1969 and 1970 were used in an 
experiment  to compare  their  growth  rate, carcass  weight,  carcass  composi ­
tion and store suitability.
All animals  were early weaned  and run together  on pasture  getting  a 
barley  meal supplement  of 2.5 lb per head per day for the first grazing  
season.  Animals  intended  for the forward  store trade were given 3 lb 
concentrates  plus self-fed  silage over the winter  and were sold off" grass  
in July at 16-17 months  of age.
Animals  intended  to go for slaughter  were given self-fed  silage in the 
first winter  and in their second  winter  were given silage plus 6 lb con­
centrates.  These  animals  were sold off grass in May 1971 at 26^ months  
and from the yards in April 1972 at 25^ months.  All carcasses  were 
weighed  and analysed.
At 17 months  the Friesians  were 8% heavier  than the Hereford  X 
Friesian  and 9 % heavier  than the Hereford  X Shorthorn.  At 26 months  the 
Friesians  were 11 % heavier  than both crosses  for the 1969 calf lot and 
4.5% and 6% heavier  respectively  than the Hereford  x Friesian  and the 
Hereford  X Shorthorn  for the 1970 lot.
The Hereford  cross animals  killed  out significantly  better  (P <0.05)  than 
the Friesians  with the consequence  that the Friesian  carcasses  though  
heavier (on  average)  than the cross  bred carcasses  were not significantly  so.
For yield and percentage  lean meat the dilferences  were not significant. 
For yield and percentage  of fat, the Friesian  was significantly  lower than 
the Hereford  X Friesian,  which in turn was significantly  lower than the 
Hereford  X Shorthorn.  Bone yield was significantly  higher (P<0.01)  
in the Friesian  than the crosses,  among  which there were no significant 
differences.

Six Friesian,  six Shorthorn  x Kerry,  seven Kerry  and seven Charolais  X 
Kerry steers and heifers  were used in a comparative  study of the beef 
potential  of crossbred  Kerry cattle. The animals  were given ad libitum  
a diet of rolled  barley,  soyabean  meal, minerals  and vitamins,  and were 
weaned  at 5 weeks of age. From approximately  13 weeks of age to 
slaughter  0.5 kg. hay was offered  daily.  The animals  were slaughtered  one 
week after reaching  400 kg. liveweight.
The Charolais  x Kerrys and Friesians  were significantly  heavier at 
weaning  than the other  two groups;  the Friesians  reached  slaughter  weight  
90, 97 and 221 days earlier than the Charolais  X Kerrys,  Shorthorn  X 
Kerrys  and Kerrys  respectively  (P <0.01).  Between  weaning  and slaughter  
the mean growth  rates for the Fresians,  Charolais  X Kerrys,  Shorthorn  x 
Kerrys  and Kerrys  were 1.24,0.95,  0.94 and 0.77 kg./day,  (P<0.01)  and 
the feed conversion  efficiencies  5.24, 5.01, 5.76 and 6.74 respectively.  The 
Charolais  X Kerrys  had the highest  dressing-out  percentage  of all groups.
The right side of each carcass  was divided  into 12 commercial  cuts 
which were dissected  into bone, subcutaneous  fatty tissue and “meat”. 
The latter two fractions  were chemically  analysed  to give total fat and 
“lean meat ” in each cut. The Charolais  x Kerrys  had significantly  more  
carcass  “lean meat ” (P<0.01)  and significantly  less carcass  fat (P<0.01)  
than all other groups;  the ShorthornXKerrys  on the other hand having  
least “lean meat ” and most  fat. The Charolais  x Kerrys  had a significantly 
greater  proportion  of “lean meat ” in the round  (P <0.01)  compared  to all 
other  breeds.  The yield of high-priced  cuts was similar  in all breeds.  The 
Charolais  X Kerrys and Friesians  had significantly  less total and sub­
cutaneous  fat in cuts than  the other  two groups  (P <0.01). The  “lean meat”: 
bone ratio was greater  in the Charolais  X Kerrys.  The Charolais  X Kerrys  
and Fresians  had significantly  less fat (P<0.01)  in the longissimus  dorsi  
muscle.

BULL BEEF PRODUCTION
by
F. J. HARTE
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
Ten years research  work at Grange  has shown  that bulls (1) grow faster,  
(2) are more  efficient  convertors  of food into liveweight  gain and into lean 
meat and (3) have more  lean meat  per unit carcass  weight  than steers.  The 
difference  in growth  rate and feed efficiency  in favour  of bulls ranged  from  
8 to 15% depending  primarily  on the age at slaughter.  Differences  in 
yield of lean meat  also depend  on age, and weight  at slaughter  and ranged  
between  15 and 30% in favour  of bulls. Management  of bulls has not been 
a problem.  It was found  that mains  electric  fencing  was a valuable  aid to 
bull management  at pasture.

METHODS  OF PROGESTAGEN  APPLICATION  FOR THE  
CONTROL  OF OESTRUS  IN CYCLIC  CATTLE
by
J. SREENAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway
Effectiveness  of method  of administration,  oestrus  response  and synchron ­
isation  and subsequent  fertility  were studied  in 88 cyclic  heifers  following  
the application  of two Progestagens  (Progesterone  and SC 9880 ICrono-  
lone])  by:
(a) intravaginal  pessary;
(b) subcutaneous  implant  or,
(c) intra-muscular  injection.
Subcutaneous  implants  were retained  in 100%  of cases while one type 
of pessary  was retained  in 95 % of cases.
Oestrus  response  following  treatment  varied from 0% in the case of 
Cronolone  subcutaneously  to 93 % in the case of Progesterone  by intra ­
vaginal  pessary.
Degree  of oestrus  synchronisation  (spread  in days on which oestrus  
occurred)  varied from one to three days. Observations  were made on 
time of oestrus  occurrence  relative  to treatment  withdrawal,  duration  of 
oestrus,  etc. for each treatment.
Conception  rates to the treatment  oestrus  (following  natural  mating)  
varied  from 46.6%  in the case of Progesterone  subcutaneously  to 75% in 
the case of Cronolone  by intramuscular  injection.

IMPROVING  THE FERTILITY  OF EWE LAMBS
by
G. KEANE
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
Early  experiments  at Grange showed  that only 50 % of ewe lambs  conceived 
at any one heat period.  During  an eight  week breeding  season  96% of ewe 
lambs  were mated,  65 % conceived  and 56 % subsequently  lambed.  Those  
animals  that lambed  had lower bodyweight  at tupping  as hoggets  and 
consequently  litter  size was lower  as compared  with their  unbred comrades.
Improving  the plane of nutrition  resulted  in a significantly  greater  
proportion  of ewe lambs  reaching  puberty  and conception  rates were also 
higher.  Studies  on mating  behaviour  showed  that adult ewes were mated  
three times more frequently  than ewe lambs during  heat and 40% of 
oestrous  ewe lambs  were left unmated.
The fertilisation  rate of ova was 88 % following  handmating  as compared  
with 45 % where  ewe lambs had free access  to rams.  Increasing  the ram :ewe 
ratio  from 1:50 to 1:10 increased  the lamb  crop,  as determined  at slaughter  
10 weeks  post mating,  from 79% to 96%.
The time of occurrence  and extent of reproductive  wastage  were  
investigated  and the results  were as follows:
Day 0 (heat)  100 ewe lambs  yielded  132 ova.
Day 3 85 ewe lambs  yielded 104 fertilised  ova.
Day 56 73 ewe lambs  yielded 91 normal  foetuses.
Day 147 (parturition)  64 ewe lambs  yielded 70 normal  lambs.

INDUCTION  OF BREEDING  ACTIVITY  IN MAIDEN  AND 
BARREN  EWES  IN SPRING
by
J. F. QUIRKE  and S. P. FLANAGAN  
Agricultural  Institute,  Creagh,  Ballinrobe,  Co. Mayo
The oestrus  response  and subsequent  lambing  performance  of 365 sheep 
was studied  after treatment  with intravaginal  sponges  and P.M.S.G.  
during  the months April/May  (period  of early  anoestrus).  Two progestagen  
treatments  were employed,  each in combination  with one or other of two 
dose levels of P.M.S.G.  (500 and 750 i.u.) given either 2 days prior to 
removal  of the sponges  or the time of pessary  withdrawal.  180 sheep  were 
also given one of two dose levels of P.M.S.G.  (500 and 750 i.u.) on the 
15th day following  sponge  removal.
The percentage  of sheep mated  was affected  by Progestagen  type, dose 
level of P.M.S.G.,  timing  of P.M.S.G.  administration  and type of animal  
(i.e. maiden  or barren  ewe); one treatment,  modified  Cronolone  pessaries  
(G. D. Searle)  in conjunction  with 750 i.u. P.M.S.G.  at pessary  removal,  
resulted  in all sheep  being  mated.
The highest  lambing  outcome  followed  use of the “Veramix ” sheep 
sponge  (Upjohn  Co.) with 750 i.u. P.M.S.G.  administered  at sponge  
withdrawal;  this treatment  resulted  in 69% of the sheep  treated  producing  
lambs.
Administration  of P.M.S.G.  2 days before Progestagen  withdrawal  
reduced  the interval  from sponge  removal  to the onset of heat by almost  
10 hours.  The incidence  of matings  following  a second  dose of P.M.S.G.  
on the 15th day following  sponge  withdrawal  was low at 21 % regardless  
of the dose level employed.

IRISH  MILLED  POLLARD  FOR BACON  PIGS
by
T. A. RYAN,  F. X. AHERNE  and P. J. CAFFREY  
University  ColUgc,  Lyons,  Newcastle  P.O., Co. Dublin
As a result  of earlier  work,  in which  replacement  of 20 and 40 per cent of 
barley  by pollard  had little effect on the performance  of bacon pigs, a 
study was undertaken  to define more precisely  the response  to pollard  
inclusion.
Three growth  trials (with supporting  metabolism  studies)  were carried  
out in which  pollard  replaced  barley  at 5 per cent increments  as follows :
(1) 0 to 25% pollard;
(2) 0 and from 25 % to 45 % pollard ;
(3) 0 and from 40% to 60% pollard.
The “O” level (barley  ration)  was included  as a control  in each trial.
As in previous  work  at Lyons,  little depression  in performance  occurred  
until pollard  formed  more than 25 % of the diet. However,  it was noted  
that pollards  with the same extraction  characteristics  but differing  in 
chemical  composition  had a significant  effect  on performance.  In general,  
there was a close relationship  between  the digestible  energy  densities  of 
the various  diets, and the corresponding  pig performance.

RESPONSE  OF GROWING-FINISHING  PIGS TO LEAST  
COST  RATIONS
by
T. J. HANRAHAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Ferrnoy,
Co. Cork
Least cost feeding  formulation  involves  selecting  a combination  of feed 
ingredients  that will supply  a specified  set of nutrient  requirements  at 
minimum  cost.
The information  required  consists  of (a) the nutritional  characteristics  
of each ingredient,  (b) the nutrient  requirements  for the livestock  in 
question,  (c) the range  and price of ingredients  available.
Experiments  comparing  least cost rations  formulated  to meet accepted  
standards  with nutritionally  proven  rations  have given variable  results.  
Rowland,  comparing  rations  formulated  to meet minimum  requirements  or 
with a 15 % safety  margin  for certain  nutrients obtained  better  performance  
where  the safety  margin  was allowed.  Lloyd  working  with pigs weaned  at 
3 weeks obtained  consistently  better feed intake from a nutritionally  
proven  ration  than from rations  formulated  to meet accepted  standards.  
The same author  concluded  that in the case of growing-finishing  pigs 
lysine,  tryptophane  and protein  were limiting  growth  in these standards.
The experiment  reported  here is designed  to evaluate  a least cost 
ration formulated  to supply 16% crude protein;  0.9% lysine; 0.55%  
methionine  plus cystine;  1.5 to 4.5% fat; 2.5 to 6% crude  fibre; 0.54 to 
0.95%  calcium  and 0.51%  phosphorus.  This is being compared  with a 
nutritionally  proven  ration  supplying  the same nutrient  levels  and consist ­
ing of 78% barley, 20% soyabean  meal and 2% mineral/vitamin  mix. 
Feed ingredients  are costed  and ration  formula  changed  bimonthly.  Upper  
limits  are placed  on the inclusion  of certain  ingredients  as follows:  maize  
and milo 40%; wheat  30%; oats and pollard  10%; molasses,  grassmeal,  
beet pulp,  cotton  seed and ground  nut 5 %; fat 3 %; fishmeal  and meat and  
bone meal 7.5%.
To date pigs fed the least  cost diet have  had 4 formulae  changes  involving  
assorted  variation  in the ingredients  used. Performance  in terms of daily  
gain and feed conversion  is slightly  better than that supported  by the 
nutritionally  proven  ration.

RESPONSE  OF LACTATING  SOWS  TO DIETS  
SUPPLEMENTED  WITH  LYSINE  AND METHIONINE
by
J. F. O’GRADY
Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Ferrnoy,  Co. Cork
Ninety-six  gilts were allocated  to treatment  at first farrowing  and during  
each of four successive  lactation  were given diets based on barley  (9.3 % 
crude  protein)  or barley  supplemented  with L-lysine  HCl (0.2%),  lysine-b  
DL methionine  (0.05%),  soyabean  meal (7.5%),  soyabean  meal (15%)  
or soyabean  meal (7.5%)-f-lysine+methionine.  During  gestation  and 
following  weaning  all sows were given 2.0 kg per day of a barley-fishmeal- 
soyabean  meal diet having  14.2%  crude protein.
Increasing  protein  level reduced  sow weight  loss in lactation  but com­
pensation  during  the next gestation  tended  to eliminate  this effect.  At the 
end of the experiment  sow weights  were not significantly  different  nor did 
carcass  dissection  reveal significant  differences  in composition  in sows  
slaughtered  after four lactations.
Litter performance  was not affected  by treatment.  As sow milk com­
position  was similar  on all treatments  it can be assumed  that milk yields  
were not affected  by treatment.
Sows given barley diets during lactation  had increased  weaning  to 
mating  intervals  following  the first and, to a lesser extent, the second 
lactation.  This effect  was not removed  when  lysine  or lysine  and methionine  
were added.
The experiment  allowed  the following  conclusions:
(1) Lysine  or methionine  are not the limiting  amino  acids in harley  
based  diets having  as low as 9.3 % crude  protein.
(2) A level of 14.2% crude protein  is superadequate  for gestating  
sows.
(3) Where  inadequate  levels  of protein  are fed in lactation,  regularity  
of breeding  is likely  to be affected  before  milk  yield  or composition.
(4) Protein  requirements  of sows are highest  in gilts and tend to 
decrease  with advancing  parity.

GENETIC  IMPROVEMENT  IN ACCREDITED  PIG HERDS
by
D. L. KELLEHER  and D. MURPHY  
Department  of Farm Management,  University  College,  Lyons,  Newcastle,
Co. Dublin
The role played by selection  on testing station results in the genetic 
improvement  of Irish accredited  pig herds between  1964 and 1971 was 
examined.
Intensity  of selection  on performance  test results was measured  by 
comparing  the performance  of boars entering  accredited  herds with the 
performance  of contemporary  boars at the testing  station.  The selection 
intensity  averaged  about 1.3 (standard  deviations)  for index score, 0.8 
for growth  performance traits  and 0.2 for fat measurements.  In calculating  
selection  intensity  on progeny  test results,  the deviation  of each boar from  
the contemporary  mean was weighted  by the number  of his progeny  
subsequently  registered  as breeding  animals  in the herdbooks.  Selection 
intensity  averaged  about  0.5 for index score,  0.2 for growth  performance  
and 0.3 for carcass  traits.
Accuracy  of selection  was studied  by computing  heritability  estimates  
based on a comparison  between  performance  and progeny  tests on the 
same boar. The estimates  obtained  were comparable  to the normally  
accepted  values  for the heritability  of each trait.
The sire-offspring  generation  interval  was found  to be 28.5 months  on 
average.
Considerable  improvement  has occurred  in the performance  of pigs at 
Irish pig testing  stations  over the past ten years. Although  this improve ­
ment cannot  be related  directly  to the selection  practised,  the results  of 
the present  study and the general  success  of the Accredited  Pig Herd  
Scheme  would suggest  that the improvement  has been at least partly  
genetic  in origin.

THE INHERITANCE  OF MEAT  QUALITY  IN PIGS
by
P. McGLOUGHLIN  and J. V. McLOUGHLIN  
Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin
Pale, soft and exudative  (P.S.E.)  muscle  is a serious  quality  defect  in pig 
meat. The biochemistry  of this condition  has been investigated,  and the 
susceptibility  of a carcass  to P.S.E.  can be assessed  by measuring  the pH 
of the longissimus  dorsi muscle  45 minutes  after slaughter  (pHj).  Low pHj 
is indicative  of the quality  defects  associated  with P.S.E.  muscle.  A study  
of pHj in Landrace  and Large  White  was carried  out using 1,154 records  
from the two National  Pig Test Stations,  where pHj has been recorded  
on all slaughter  pigs since October  1970.
There  was a significant  difference  between  the mean of the two breeds ; 
Landrace  pigs had lower average  pHj values,  and a greater  proportion  
of the values  for this breed fell below 6.00, which  is considered  to be a 
critical  level. The heritability  of pHj was higher  in the Landrace  breed  
than in the Large  White,  and the values  indicated  that both breeds  would  
respond  to selection  for this trait. Genetic  correlations  with growth  rate, 
food conversion  ratio and backfat  indicated  no definite  relationships  
between  pHj and any of these traits.  There  was no evidence  to show that 
recent  importations  from Britain  have had any affect on meat quality  in 
Irish pigs. There  was no significant  difference  between  the pHj values  of 
boars, castrates  and females,  nor was there any evidence  of seasonal  
variation.

THE IRISH GRASSLAND  ASSOCIATION  was 
founded  in 1947 with the aim of promoting  the knowl ­
edge of grassland  production.
In 1961, the name of the Association  was modified,  
in recognition  of the fact that good grassland  husbandry  
is intimately  associated  with, and inseparable  from, good  
livestock  husbandry.
The Association  provides  an opportunity  for those  
interested  in modern  grassland  farming  to gather and 
interchange  views and ideas; it provides  a platform  for 
forward-looking  farmers  and scientists  to expound  their  
ideas; it fosters  and encourages  research  into the produc ­
tion and utilisation  of grassland,  and it aims to co­
operate with organisations  which has in common  the 
improvement  of grassland  farming.
