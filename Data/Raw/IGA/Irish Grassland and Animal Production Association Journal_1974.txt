FIFTH RICHARDS-ORPEN  MEMORIAL  LECTURE
DAIRY FARMING  SYSTEMS  1974
by
D. BROWNE
National  Dairying  Research  Centre,  Moorepark,  Fermoy.
Introduction
Mr. Chairman,  ladies and gentlemen,  it is my pleasure  to present  
the 5th Richards-Orpen  Memorial  Lecture  and I would like to thank  
the trustees  for their very kind invitation  to do so. In this presentat ­
ion dairy farming  systems  which are applicable  to 1974 conditions  will 
be discussed.  These systems  are combinations  of the thinking  and 
practice  of progressive  dairy farmers,  together  with the ideas and dev­
elopments  which have come from Moorepark  and its field stations  over 
the past 15 years. This 15 year period  has been characterised  by many  
desirable  changes  in the whole  structure  of the diary industry.  Amongst  
the significant  developments  have been:(1)  a more general  acceptance  
of increased  stock-carrying  capacity  on individual  dairy farms which  
has resulted  in a substantial  increase  in the national  cow herd and
(2) a much greater  degree  of rationalisation  in the creamery  structure.  
These developments  must continue  if we are to increase  our compet ­
itiveness.
At farm level there is considerable  potential  for improvement  in the 
organisation  of the work load so that more cows can be carried  with a 
reduced  work load. Good organisation  means  good stock  control,  and 
a management  system  whereby  key decisions  can be made with minimal  
effort. To achieve  this a calendar  based system  for the key manage ­
ment decisions  is proposed.
Dairying  on wet land.
The Mullinahone  field station provided  by Mullinahone  Co-op.  is 
being used to develop  dairying  systems  for wet land conditions.  One-  
third of the Mullinahone  farm is classified  as free-draining;  one-third  is 
imperfectly  drained;  and the remaining  third is poorly-drained.  This 
farm is considered  to be representative  of approximately  35% of the 
land used for dairying  in the Republic.  The farm was drained  to Land  
Project  specifications  and a central  farm roadway  laid on the grass sur­
face. The total area was fenced  into four farmlets,  each farmlet  having 
a proportion  of each soil type. On two of the farmlets,  nitrogen  usage  
was confined  to the silage area while on the remaining  two 200 lb nit­
rogen per acre per annum  was used. The milk yields  in the 71, 72 and 
73 seasons  are given in Table 1. All herds were spring  calving;  calving  
commenced  in late January  and in all years the shed was closed for 
4-6 weeks from early December.  During  the winter period all herds  
were self-fed  on silage cut from their respective  farmlets.  The annual 
meal supplementation  averaged  200 lb per cow.

At both nitrogen  levels increasing  the stocking  rate reduced  milk 
yield per cow in all years with one exception  in 1973 on the low nit­
rogen level. Neither  stocking  rate nor nitrogen  level affected  the fat 
content. However,  protein  content  on the high stocked  low nitrogen  
herd was significantly  depressed.  The milk yield of the low S.R./high  N 
group was significantly  higher  than that of low S.R./low  N groups.
This has been a consistent  feature  of the Mullinahone  results. The 
mean results for 1971-1973  period  are shown  in Table 2. On average,  
increasing  stocking  rates on the low nitrogen  farms decreased  pro­
duction  per cow by 58 gallons  or 9% but increased  production  per acre 
by 72 gallons. On the high N farms increasing  the stocking  rate from  
1.1 to 0.88 acres pmr cow significantly  decreased  milk yield per cow 
but marginally  increased  milk yield per acre. These  results  suggest  that 
on this type of land a stocking  rate of 1.0/cow  to 1.3 acres is possible  
with low nitrogen  usage. Where 200 lb of N is used a stock carrying  
capacity  of 1 cow per acre is possible.

Calendar  Blueprint  for wet land.
The calendar  of operations  necessary  to achieve  a stocking  rate of
1 cow per acre (on a 100 acre farm) is outlined  in Table 3. The foll­
owing  herd management  recommendations  are proposed:
(1) calving  should  begin towards  the end of January;
(2) calved  cows should  be fed 8 lb meal (15% protein)  per head per 
day in addition  to ad lib silage;
(3) the milking  cows should  be on grass by April 1, the dry cows re­
maining  on self-fed  silage;
(4) the first paddocks  grazed should be those from which it is in­
tended  to cut silage. The main limitation  to grazing  before  April  
1 is the risk of excessive  poaching.  Serious  poaching  has not 
occured  after April 1 on the Mullinahone  farm since operations  
began there in 1966. When grazing  commences  on April 1, the 
second  round  of grazing  will usually  begin around  April 20. Pad- 
docks are closed  for silage after second  grazing;  it is necessary  to 
close 45% of the total farm area to achieve  the proposed  target.  
At the overall  stocking  rate of 1 cow per acre the actual  stocking  
rate on the grazed  area during  this first silage cut is 1.8 cows or 
livestock  units per acre. It is possible  to carry this stocking  rate 
where  nitrogen  is used without  any significant  depression  in milk 
yield per cow.
(5) The first silage cut is usually  taken around  June 10 and is follow ­
ed by a second  cut of silage from 30% of the farm area which  
is being cut for the second  time. The stocking  rate on the grazed  
area during  the second  silage period  is 1.4 cows/acre.  It is also 
possible  to achieve  this stocking  rate without  depression  in milk 
yield per cow. When the second  cut has been taken the total 
area is grazed  at the overall  stocking  rate of 1 livestock  unit p)er 
acre until late November.  Silage yields  of 9 tons and 6 tons per 
acre from cuts 1 and 2, respectively,  provide  5.85 tons per cow 
which is more than adequate  for the Mullinahone  winter  which  
is usually  about 130 days.

Dairying  on free-draining  land.
Research  results from Moorepark  and from the Kilmeaden  field 
station  owned  by Waterford  Co-op.  are used to develop  dairying systems  
for free-draining  land. The results obtained  in the Kilmeaden  field 
station  for 1971-1972  (Tables  4 and 5) are typical  results  for free-drain ­
ing land situations.  On both nitrogen  levels increasing  stocking  rate 
significantly  reduced  milk yield per cow. There were no significant  
differences  between  nitrogen  levels at the low or at the high stock ­
ing rates. On both nitrogen  levels increasing  stocking  rate increased  
production  per acre. From these and other data we conclude  that 
where low levels of nitrogen  are used a target  of 1 cow to 1.1 acre is 
possible;  where 200 lb of nitrogen  per acre is used a target  of 1.25 cows  
per acre is possible.

Calendar  Blueprint  for dry land (low N).
A calendar  of operations  for a free draining  farm receiving  a low
level of nitrogen  is outlined  in Table 6. The stocking  rate proposed  is
75 cows and replacements  (25%) on 100 acres i.e. 1.06 acres per cow.
The principal  recommendations  to achieve  this target  are;
(1) calving  begins  in mid-January
(2) calved  cows fed 8 lb meal as per P. Gleesons  recommendation
(3) grazing  begins  in early March
(4) the key decision  influencing  the quantity  of silage is made in 
mid-April.  Adequate  silage can be obtained  if 45% of the total 
farm area is closed  for the first and only silage cut. This means  
that the stocking  rate on the grazed  portion  of the farm is 1.69 
L.U./acre.  A yield of 9 tons/acre  from  this cut will provide  4.35 
tons per cow. A second  silage option  is possible.  This proposes  
35% of the total farm area for the first cut and a resultant  stock ­
ing rate of 1.43 L.U./acre  followed  by a second  cut/from  15 per­
cent of the total farm area. Yields  of 9 and 6 tons from the 
first and second cuts respectively,  also provides  4.35 tons per 
cow. Farmers  who are farming  at this stocking  rate should  aim 
to get all their silage from the first cut. In the event of the re­
sulting  stocking  rate proving  too high in certain  seasons  a port­
ion of the area reserved  for silage (15 acres) could be released  
for grazing  and used for a second  cut.

DRAINING  LAND  (HIGH N):
The important  management  decisions  to carry 1 cow -r replace­
ments (25%) on one acre of land are incorporated  on a calendar  basis in 
Table 7. The overall  stocking  rate is 1 cow to 0.8 acres (1.25  cows per 
acre). It is suggested  for the creamery  herd that calving  begins  in mid-
January. The calved cows are fed silage + 8 lb meal per day as per 
P. Gleeson's  recommendation;  the dry cows are fed silage only.  
Gleesons  work at Moorepark  has shown  quite clearly  that dry cows can 
be adequately  maintained  on reasonable  quality  self-fed  silage.

Date of First Grazing.
Too much mental  effort  is used in making  this decision  and in gener ­
al people  tend to be far too conservative  in their attitude  to putting  
cows on to grass early. The advantages  of putting  the calved  cows out 
to grass early in March are:
(1) Milk yield per cow increases  when the cows go on to grass even 
when there is little grass available,  or perhaps  I should  say when 
there appears  to be little grass available.
(2) Concentrate  feeding  can be stopped  so the combination  of reduc ­
ed concentrate  feeding  and increased  milk yields  result  in increas­
ed income  to the farmer.
(3) Having  cows on grass eases the work load. Cows  are cleaner  and 
consequently  easier  to milk.
(4) Lastly, but most importantly,  putting  the cows out early in 
March has no ill-effects  on total grass growth. McFeely  has 
shown  this for the past 3 years (Tables  8 and 9). Three  dates of 
first grazing  were compared,  March 7th, March  28th, April 19th;  
and they were compared  with no nitrogen  applied  (Table  8) with 
40 lb N per acre per grazing (Table 9). In both cases even 
though they were significant  differences  in the amount  of dry 
matter  harvested  in each of the three first grazings,  there  was no 
effect in total dry matter  produced  up to the end of June under  
both systems. These  data strongly  support  the recommendation
for an early start to grazing  on the dairy farm. To ease the total 
management  burden  we would  suggest  that the milking  cows are 
put on to grass early in March  irrespective  of apparent  amount  of 
grass available  for them.

First Silage  Cut
On free-draining  farms where  grazing  starts  early the paddocks  from  
which silage will be cut are the last paddocks  to be grazed in the first 
rotation. When  these  paddocks  are grazed  for the second  time they are 
closed  and fertilised  for silage. This should  happen  between  the 10th 
and 24th of April. This is a crucial  decision  and it is best made on a 
calendar  basis. If one waits for surplus  feed conditions  one will invari ­
ably find that it is too late and that the first cut of silage cannot  be tak­
en until mid-June.  This disrupts  the whole  system  and results  in poorer  
silage quality.  The key to farming  1 cow to 0.8 acres is to close a suffic ­
ient area for silage in mid-April.  If the resultant  stocking  rate is depress ­
ing milk yield then a portion  can be released  for grazing. It is not poss­
ible to do the reverse  successfully.  To over-winter  this stocking  rate of 
1.25 cows per acre on self-fed  silage requires  that 45% of the total farm  
area is closed  for the first cut. Where  45% is closed  the resulting  stock ­
ing rate on the grazed  area is 2.27 cows per acre. This stocking  rate is 
possible  during  the very active period  of grass growth  in late April and 
May. However  this is a crucial  decision  and it is important  that the far­
mer should  be conscious  of the implications  of changing  this percentage.  
If at the stocking  rate of 1.25 L.U. per acre the farmer  decided  to con­
serve 50% of the area rather  than 45%, the net effect  on stocking  press ­
ure on the grazed  area is to increase  it from 2.27 to 2.50. This is equiv ­
alent to an increase  of 23 cows per 100 acres. In some  situations  this 
increased  stocking  rate may be too high and may result  in an excessive  
reduction  in yield per cow. Similarly,  if grazing  pressure  is too high on 
a 20 paddock  farm the release  of one of the silage  paddocks  to the graz­
ing area means  that the stocking  rate is reduced  from 2.27 to 2.08 i.e. a 
reduction  of 19 cows per 100 acres which  in most circumstances  will be 
sufficient  to overcome  a temporary  slow period of grass growth.
Second  Silage  Cut
When the first silage area (45% of the farm) is closed  in mid-April  it 
can be cut on June 1 and followed  immediately  with a second  cut on 
30% of the total farm area. This 30% should  be taken  from that part 
of the farm from which the first cut was taken. The stocking  rate dur­
ing the second  cut is 1.75 cows per acre which it is possible  to take 
without  reducing  yields per cow. When  the second  cut of silage is tak­
en in late July the total farm area is grazed  until late November.  A 
yield of 9 and 6 tons per acre from the first and second  cuts respective ­
ly ensures  4.6 tons per cow for the winter  period. This is sufficient  for 
the Moorepark  winter  of 110 days.
Kilmeaden  Calendar  and Results.
This calendar  method  of operation  was fairly rigidly  observed  in the 
1973 experiment  (at Kilmeaden)  which compared  two levels  of nitrog ­
en (Table 10). The experiment  examined  a range of stocking  rates  
from 0.96 to 1.58 cows per acre. The only deviation  from the suggest ­
ed calendar  was that the cutting  date for the first silage cut was one 
week late and consequently  the cutting  date of the second  silage was a 
week late also. The yields  obtained  where 200 lb N was used are out­
lined in Table 11 where stocking  rates of 0.96, 1.19 and 1.33 cows per 
acre were compared.  The stocking  rates during  the first silage cut rang­
ed from 1.9 to 2.41 cows per acre and during  the second  silage cut 
from 1.43 to 1.82 cows per acre. There  was no effect  on yield per cow 
which averaged  693 gallons.

Nitrogen  Usage
Using 200 lb N per acre permits  an increase  in stock carrying  capac ­
ity of 30%. The use of higher  nitrogen  applications  to further  increase  
stocking  rates is being researched.  In Moorepark  it was previously  
shown  that increasing  the nitrogen  level above  the 200 lb per acre level 
did not permit  a further  increase  in stock carrying  capacity  when bull­
ocks were used. An experiment  designed  to examine  the response  for 
dairying  commenced  at the Kilmeaden  field station  in 1973 (Table  12). 
Two nitrogen  levels were compared  at three stocking  rates. On all 
treatments  nitrogen  was applied  in January  for the first grazing  and 
thereafter  three  of the farmlets  received  1 cwt of 26% N after every  sec­
ond grazing. The total nitrogen  usage in this case was 230 Ib/acre. On 
the remaining  three farmlets  1 cwt of 26% N was used after every graz­
ing which is a total of 380 Ib/acre. The advantages  of the higher  nit­
rogen level at the comparable  stocking  rates of .84 and .75 were non­
significant. However  on the 380 lb N level the high stocking  rate of 
.63 or 158 cows per 100 acre did result  in a depression  per cow and in a 
depression  in silage yield. This information  suggests  that on perennial  
ryegrass  type swards  the use of higher levels of nitrogen  for stocking  
rates of up to 135 cows per 100 acres must be seriously  questioned  and 
the data available  to date would  not justify  a higher  usage  than 200 lb.

The intensively  stocked  dairy farmer  can only keep his nitrogen  app­
lication  rate at 200 lb by omitting  the application  of nitrogen  after cer­
tain grazings. The available  information  suggests  1 cwt of 26% N or 
equivalent  for the first grazing  (applied  in January)  and the same level 
of nitrogen  for the second  and third grazings. Afterwards  1 cwt N 
should  be used after every second  grazing. Obviously  if there  were per­
iods of severe  shortage  this N level may be increased  but this situation  
at stocking  rates up to 130 cows per 100 acres should  be a rare occurr ­
ence.
0.8 Management  Technique
As the 1973 Kilmeaden  results  show,  (Table  12) stocking  rates in ex­
cess of .8 (or 1.25 cows per acre) can be successfully  achieved  in certain  
situations. The management  implications  of stocking  at .7 or 1.43 
cows per acre are examined  in Table 13. If stocking  rates of 2.25 for 
the first and 1.75 for the second  silage cut cannot  be exceeded  then the 
amount  of silage available  will be 3 tons per cow. This is unlikely  to 
be sufficient  in most circumstances.  However,  if stocking  rates of 2.6 
i.e. 45% of the farm area closed,  can be achieved  in the first cut and 
2.04 cows (30% of the farm area) in the second,  then the silage avail ­
able per cow is increased  to 4.09 tons per cow. There are obviously  
some situations  in the south where  this target  can and has been achiev ­
ed by some of our more progressive  farmers.

Replacement  Rate Effect
The stocking  rate targets  suggested  have included  a percentage  re­
placement  rate of 25%. This replacement  rate is higher  than normal  so 
consequently  the targets  suggested  are conservative.  A reduction  in 
the percentage  replacement  rate from 20 to 15% means  that an extra 5 
cows can be carried. A 10% replacement  figure which is achievable 
with excellent  management  means  that an additional  13 cows per 100 
acres can be carried. Using this data the effect  of culling  low yielders  
on the overall increase  in herd performance  can be assessed. If on a 
self-contained  farm, only 15% of the herd needs  to be replaced  for dis­
ease and infertility  the option  of culling  low yielders  by increasing  the 
culling  percentage  to 20% can be considered.  An increase  in the cull­
ing percentage  from 15 to 20 means  that 5 fewer cows are milked.
Assuming  that the low yielders  culled milked  300 gallons  the replace­
ment heifers  entering  the herd must milk an average  of 570 gallons  to 
make the increased  culling  rate financially  attractive.  Conversely  if a 
farmer  can maintain  a 15% replacement  rate he would  be better  off to 
keep his 300 gallon cows if the heifers  coming  in milked  less than 570 
gallons.
Facilities  Required  and Labour  Productivity
The stock carrying  capacities  under discussion  are not possible  on 
the majority  of Irish dairy farms  without  major re-organisation  of road­
ways, paddocks  and buildings.  Progress  in this respect  has been slower  
than one would wish. Any attempt  to achieve  these stocking  rates  
even on small farms without  proper  facilities  can only lead to further  
hardship  and diminishes  the concept  of dairying  as an attractive  way of 
life. The recommendation  to improve  facilities  on a dairy farm is only 
relevant  if the additional  cost can be met from the increased  sales with­
out reducing  living standards. Although  the sum involved  is high 
(Table 14), it can be financed  on a longterm  basis from intensive  dairy  
farming  systems. The annual  cost of providing  these facilities  is now 
less than the cost of fertiliser. It must be looked  at in this light as an 
essential  input. Without  good facilities,  nationally  we would  probably  
never accept the concept  of one man handling  more than 40 cows  
whereas  with these facilities  the concept  of one man plus relief looking  
after 100 cows is a real possibility.  The latter viewpoint  is of course  
not very widely  held. The essential  facilities  required  on well-run  dairy  
farms are firstly a good milking  shed. The Moorepark  open-sided  shed 
with its absence  of steps, doors, feeders  and glass jars will satisfy  the 
requirement  on most dairy farms provided  the shed is built big enough 
the minimum  number  of units per man being  six with the possibility  of 
one man being able to handle  up to 10 when the occasion  demands.  A 
central  gravel or metal roadway  is absolutely  essential  and paddocks  are 
essential  to make management  easier. P. McFeely  is currently  looking  
at the advantages  of 30 paddock  system  versus  a 10 paddock  system 
and to date the milk yield advantage  in favour  of the 30 paddock  one 
day system  is quite small. The high stocking  rates achieved  have been 
achieved  at the Agricultural  Institute  stations  with 10-12 paddocks. 
Certainly  20 paddocks  will permit  a sufficient  degree  of management 
sophistication  for most situations.  Calving  boxes  are essential  as cow 
numbers  grow.
On a 100 acre farm the annual  repayment  of the total sum required  
of £13,300  for a 15 year period  with a 20% grant for a commercial  
farm is £17.14  per acre; on a development  farm with a 30% grant the 
annual repayment  is £1500  or £15 per acre. These  facilities  are essent ­
ial to attain these higher stocking  rates. The relevant  question  for 
farmers  contemplating  development  is whether  the amount  required  
for facilities  can be met together  with the finance  required  for stock.

Dairy Merit
One of the factors  which obviously  has a big effect on repayment  
capacity  is total sales per cow, i.e. the combination  of milk price, calf 
price, and most important  the gallonage  produced  per cow. Walshe's  
experiment  on dairy merit (Table  15) showed  that high merit cows re­
acted in the same way as low merit  cows to increased  stocking  pressure.  
High milk yields  per cow must be sought  as well as increased  stocking  
rate to maximise  returns. At present  milk prices  an increase  of 100 
gallons  per cow which is available  through  genetic  improvement  would  
provide  sufficient  finance  to fertilise  the intensively  stocked  farm. The 
top third of the Kilmeaden  herd in 1973 milked  850 gallons  per cow 
which at the high stocking  rates on which  they were carried  and an ex­
pected  price of 22p per gallon  represents  gross sales per acre for milk of 
£250;  certainly  something  to be aimed  for.

Increased  Stocking  Rates using some Purchased  Winter Feedstuffs.
In the past year experimentation  at the Curtins  farm at Moorepark  
examined  the possibility  of carrying  stocking  rates of 1.5 and 1.75 
cows per acre. The objective  was to design  a system  of management  
which would maximise  the amount  of silage which could be cut from  
these two stocking  rates without  depressing  per cow performance.  The 
results in Table 16 show that stocking  rates of 2.75 cows per acre for 
the first cut and 2.0 cows per acre for the second  cut has a significant
depressing  effect  on per cow production.  The silage  yields  were estimat ­
ed as 2.9, 4.7, 1.0 and 2.4 tons per cow on treatments  A, B, C and D 
respectively.  The shortfall  in winter  feed is supplied  by molasses,  a 
protein  supplement  and straw  diet designed  by T. Butler.

Economic  Analysis
Gross profit figures  were calculated  for a range  of farm sizes from 20 
to 200 acres with a range of stock carrying  capacities  of 0.66 cows per 
acre to 2.0 cows per acre. These data were computed  for a range in 
sales per cow of 130 - £250  per cow. The gross profit  figures  obtained  
for the stocking  rates, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 cows per acre for each of 
the following  sales per cow; £150, £170, £190 and £230 are shown  in 
Tables  17 and 18 for 50 and 100 acre farms  respectively.  From  these  
gross profit  figures  the total labour  charges  and the capital  and interest  
repayment  must be deducted.  This data has been computed  for curr­
ent prices including  the recent  30-35%  increase  in fertiliser  prices. Ni­
trogen level is increased  as stocking  rates are increased. The same  
nitrogen  level of 200 Ib/acre  is used on the 1.50 and the 1.25 stocking  
rates. The data assumes  that the farms  are self-sufficie.it  for winter  fed 
up to 1.25 cows per acre for a 120-day  winter. The 1.50 stocking  rate 
was calculated  at a 140-day  winter. A depreciation  figure of £25 per 
cow was used. The principal  findings  from Tables 17 and 18 are
(1) an increase  in gross profit  per acre as stocking  rate is increased  up 
to the 1.25 cows per acre level
(2) a decrease  in gross profit per acre if stocking  rate is further  in­
creased  to 1.50 cows per acre
(3) a striking  effect  of sales per cow on the gross profit  figure.

The effect  on gross profit of increasing  the stocking  rate from 0.66 
to 0.8; from 0.8 to 1.0 and from 1.0 to 1.25 cows per acre is given in 
Table 19 for a 100 acre farm. An increase  in the stocking  rate from  
0.66 to 1.25 cows per acre at £150 sales per cow increases  gross profit  
by £4,542,  rising to £9,206  when sales per cow reached  £230. The 
annual  repayment  charges  (assuming  the farmer  has to borrow)  and any 
increased  labour  charges  must be deducted  from these gross profit  fig­
ures. The figure for gross profit  less repayments  with cows valued  at 
£200 repaid over a 5 year period,  and with facilities  repaid  over a 15 
year programme  is shown  in Table 20. The data assumes  that the 100 
.acre farm is considered  a "development"  farm under  Directive  159. In­
creasing  stocking  rate from 0.66 to 1.25 cows per acre increases  gross  
profits by £1,255  at £150 sales per cow (labour  not deducted).  The 
figures  for gross profit less repayments  for a 100-acre  farm is consider ­
ed a "commercial"  farm are presented  in Table 21. The main differ ­
ence is that there  is no subsidy  on livestock  purchases  for the "commer ­
cial" farm. The gross profit  increases  are reasonable  but the high inter ­
est rates and the short term availability  of finance  for the "developi-  
ment" are making  things unduly  difficult  for "commercial"  farmers.  
The implications  of increasing  the term for livestock  borrowing  from 5 
to 10 years at two values  for cows is shown  in Table  22. At the £200  
level increasing  the term from 5 years to 10 years  reduces  the annual  re­
payment  by £2,409  on the "commercial"  farm.

The repayment  schedule  which a farmer  has to meet if he is chang ­
ing from a different  farming  system  to intensive  dairying  at 1.25 cows  
per acre on 100 acres is high (Table  22). In such a case it is imperative  
that the livestock  money  should  be borrowed  for a 10 year period.
Conclusions.
The attractiveness  of dairying  in 1974 can be improved  for many 
Irish dairy farmers. The cost of good facilities  borrowed  long term can 
be financed  from the profits  of intensive  dairying. The availability  of 
long term finance  is necessary  to accelerate  intensification.  Calendar  - 
based management  plans permit the achievement  of higher stocking  
rates with minimum  difficulty. Higher  yielding  cows are essential  to 
improve  the financial  returns  and to provide  sufficient  income  to pay 
relief staff thereby  permitting  reasonable  time off. With these improve ­
ments dairying  in 1974 and succeeding  years can be an attractive  and 
financially  rewarding  Farm Enterprise.

FIFTH RICHARDS-ORPEN  MEMORIAL  LECTURE
DAIRY FARMING  SYSTEMS  1974
by
D. BROWNE
National  Dairying  Research  Centre,  Moorepark,  Fermoy.
Introduction
Mr. Chairman,  ladies and gentlemen,  it is my pleasure  to present  
the 5th Richards-Orpen  Memorial  Lecture  and I would like to thank  
the trustees  for their very kind invitation  to do so. In this presentat ­
ion dairy farming  systems  which are applicable  to 1974 conditions  will 
be discussed.  These systems  are combinations  of the thinking  and 
practice  of progressive  dairy farmers,  together  with the ideas and dev­
elopments  which have come from Moorepark  and its field stations  over 
the past 15 years. This 15 year period  has been characterised  by many  
desirable  changes  in the whole  structure  of the diary industry.  Amongst  
the significant  developments  have been:(1)  a more general  acceptance  
of increased  stock-carrying  capacity  on individual  dairy farms which  
has resulted  in a substantial  increase  in the national  cow herd and
(2) a much greater  degree  of rationalisation  in the creamery  structure.  
These developments  must continue  if we are to increase  our compet ­
itiveness.
At farm level there is considerable  potential  for improvement  in the 
organisation  of the work load so that more cows can be carried  with a 
reduced  work load. Good organisation  means  good stock  control,  and 
a management  system  whereby  key decisions  can be made with minimal  
effort. To achieve  this a calendar  based system  for the key manage ­
ment decisions  is proposed.
Dairying  on wet land.
The Mullinahone  field station provided  by Mullinahone  Co-op.  is 
being used to develop  dairying  systems  for wet land conditions.  One-  
third of the Mullinahone  farm is classified  as free-draining;  one-third  is 
imperfectly  drained;  and the remaining  third is poorly-drained.  This 
farm is considered  to be representative  of approximately  35% of the 
land used for dairying  in the Republic.  The farm was drained  to Land  
Project  specifications  and a central  farm roadway  laid on the grass sur­
face. The total area was fenced  into four farmlets,  each farmlet  having 
a proportion  of each soil type. On two of the farmlets,  nitrogen  usage  
was confined  to the silage area while on the remaining  two 200 lb nit­
rogen per acre per annum  was used. The milk yields  in the 71, 72 and 
73 seasons  are given in Table 1. All herds were spring  calving;  calving  
commenced  in late January  and in all years the shed was closed for 
4-6 weeks from early December.  During  the winter period all herds  
were self-fed  on silage cut from their respective  farmlets.  The annual 
meal supplementation  averaged  200 lb per cow.

At both nitrogen  levels increasing  the stocking  rate reduced  milk 
yield per cow in all years with one exception  in 1973 on the low nit­
rogen level. Neither  stocking  rate nor nitrogen  level affected  the fat 
content. However,  protein  content  on the high stocked  low nitrogen  
herd was significantly  depressed.  The milk yield of the low S.R./high  N 
group was significantly  higher  than that of low S.R./low  N groups.
This has been a consistent  feature  of the Mullinahone  results. The 
mean results for 1971-1973  period  are shown  in Table 2. On average,  
increasing  stocking  rates on the low nitrogen  farms decreased  pro­
duction  per cow by 58 gallons  or 9% but increased  production  per acre 
by 72 gallons. On the high N farms increasing  the stocking  rate from  
1.1 to 0.88 acres pmr cow significantly  decreased  milk yield per cow 
but marginally  increased  milk yield per acre. These  results  suggest  that 
on this type of land a stocking  rate of 1.0/cow  to 1.3 acres is possible  
with low nitrogen  usage. Where 200 lb of N is used a stock carrying  
capacity  of 1 cow per acre is possible.

Calendar  Blueprint  for wet land.
The calendar  of operations  necessary  to achieve  a stocking  rate of
1 cow per acre (on a 100 acre farm) is outlined  in Table 3. The foll­
owing  herd management  recommendations  are proposed:
(1) calving  should  begin towards  the end of January;
(2) calved  cows should  be fed 8 lb meal (15% protein)  per head per 
day in addition  to ad lib silage;
(3) the milking  cows should  be on grass by April 1, the dry cows re­
maining  on self-fed  silage;
(4) the first paddocks  grazed should be those from which it is in­
tended  to cut silage. The main limitation  to grazing  before  April  
1 is the risk of excessive  poaching.  Serious  poaching  has not 
occured  after April 1 on the Mullinahone  farm since operations  
began there in 1966. When grazing  commences  on April 1, the 
second  round  of grazing  will usually  begin around  April 20. Pad- 
docks are closed  for silage after second  grazing;  it is necessary  to 
close 45% of the total farm area to achieve  the proposed  target.  
At the overall  stocking  rate of 1 cow per acre the actual  stocking  
rate on the grazed  area during  this first silage cut is 1.8 cows or 
livestock  units per acre. It is possible  to carry this stocking  rate 
where  nitrogen  is used without  any significant  depression  in milk 
yield per cow.
(5) The first silage cut is usually  taken around  June 10 and is follow ­
ed by a second  cut of silage from 30% of the farm area which  
is being cut for the second  time. The stocking  rate on the grazed  
area during  the second  silage period  is 1.4 cows/acre.  It is also 
possible  to achieve  this stocking  rate without  depression  in milk 
yield per cow. When the second  cut has been taken the total 
area is grazed  at the overall  stocking  rate of 1 livestock  unit p)er 
acre until late November.  Silage yields  of 9 tons and 6 tons per 
acre from cuts 1 and 2, respectively,  provide  5.85 tons per cow 
which is more than adequate  for the Mullinahone  winter  which  
is usually  about 130 days.

Dairying  on free-draining  land.
Research  results from Moorepark  and from the Kilmeaden  field 
station  owned  by Waterford  Co-op.  are used to develop  dairying systems  
for free-draining  land. The results obtained  in the Kilmeaden  field 
station  for 1971-1972  (Tables  4 and 5) are typical  results  for free-drain ­
ing land situations.  On both nitrogen  levels increasing  stocking  rate 
significantly  reduced  milk yield per cow. There were no significant  
differences  between  nitrogen  levels at the low or at the high stock ­
ing rates. On both nitrogen  levels increasing  stocking  rate increased  
production  per acre. From these and other data we conclude  that 
where low levels of nitrogen  are used a target  of 1 cow to 1.1 acre is 
possible;  where 200 lb of nitrogen  per acre is used a target  of 1.25 cows  
per acre is possible.

Calendar  Blueprint  for dry land (low N).
A calendar  of operations  for a free draining  farm receiving  a low
level of nitrogen  is outlined  in Table 6. The stocking  rate proposed  is
75 cows and replacements  (25%) on 100 acres i.e. 1.06 acres per cow.
The principal  recommendations  to achieve  this target  are;
(1) calving  begins  in mid-January
(2) calved  cows fed 8 lb meal as per P. Gleesons  recommendation
(3) grazing  begins  in early March
(4) the key decision  influencing  the quantity  of silage is made in 
mid-April.  Adequate  silage can be obtained  if 45% of the total 
farm area is closed  for the first and only silage cut. This means  
that the stocking  rate on the grazed  portion  of the farm is 1.69 
L.U./acre.  A yield of 9 tons/acre  from  this cut will provide  4.35 
tons per cow. A second  silage option  is possible.  This proposes  
35% of the total farm area for the first cut and a resultant  stock ­
ing rate of 1.43 L.U./acre  followed  by a second  cut/from  15 per­
cent of the total farm area. Yields  of 9 and 6 tons from the 
first and second cuts respectively,  also provides  4.35 tons per 
cow. Farmers  who are farming  at this stocking  rate should  aim 
to get all their silage from the first cut. In the event of the re­
sulting  stocking  rate proving  too high in certain  seasons  a port­
ion of the area reserved  for silage (15 acres) could be released  
for grazing  and used for a second  cut.

The important  management  decisions  to carry 1 cow -r replace­
ments (25%) on one acre of land are incorporated  on a calendar  basis in 
Table 7. The overall  stocking  rate is 1 cow to 0.8 acres (1.25  cows per 
acre). It is suggested  for the creamery  herd that calving  begins  in mid-
January. The calved cows are fed silage + 8 lb meal per day as per 
P. Gleeson's  recommendation;  the dry cows are fed silage only.  
Gleesons  work at Moorepark  has shown  quite clearly  that dry cows can 
be adequately  maintained  on reasonable  quality  self-fed  silage.

Date of First Grazing.
Too much mental  effort  is used in making  this decision  and in gener ­
al people  tend to be far too conservative  in their attitude  to putting  
cows on to grass early. The advantages  of putting  the calved  cows out 
to grass early in March are:
(1) Milk yield per cow increases  when the cows go on to grass even 
when there is little grass available,  or perhaps  I should  say when 
there appears  to be little grass available.
(2) Concentrate  feeding  can be stopped  so the combination  of reduc ­
ed concentrate  feeding  and increased  milk yields  result  in increas­
ed income  to the farmer.
(3) Having  cows on grass eases the work load. Cows  are cleaner  and 
consequently  easier  to milk.
(4) Lastly, but most importantly,  putting  the cows out early in 
March has no ill-effects  on total grass growth. McFeely  has 
shown  this for the past 3 years (Tables  8 and 9). Three  dates of 
first grazing  were compared,  March 7th, March  28th, April 19th;  
and they were compared  with no nitrogen  applied  (Table  8) with 
40 lb N per acre per grazing (Table 9). In both cases even 
though they were significant  differences  in the amount  of dry 
matter  harvested  in each of the three first grazings,  there  was no 
effect in total dry matter  produced  up to the end of June under  
both systems. These  data strongly  support  the recommendation
for an early start to grazing  on the dairy farm. To ease the total 
management  burden  we would  suggest  that the milking  cows are 
put on to grass early in March  irrespective  of apparent  amount  of 
grass available  for them.

First Silage  Cut
On free-draining  farms where  grazing  starts  early the paddocks  from  
which silage will be cut are the last paddocks  to be grazed in the first 
rotation. When  these  paddocks  are grazed  for the second  time they are 
closed  and fertilised  for silage. This should  happen  between  the 10th 
and 24th of April. This is a crucial  decision  and it is best made on a 
calendar  basis. If one waits for surplus  feed conditions  one will invari ­
ably find that it is too late and that the first cut of silage cannot  be tak­
en until mid-June.  This disrupts  the whole  system  and results  in poorer  
silage quality.  The key to farming  1 cow to 0.8 acres is to close a suffic ­
ient area for silage in mid-April.  If the resultant  stocking  rate is depress ­
ing milk yield then a portion  can be released  for grazing. It is not poss­
ible to do the reverse  successfully.  To over-winter  this stocking  rate of 
1.25 cows per acre on self-fed  silage requires  that 45% of the total farm  
area is closed  for the first cut. Where  45% is closed  the resulting  stock ­
ing rate on the grazed  area is 2.27 cows per acre. This stocking  rate is 
possible  during  the very active period  of grass growth  in late April and 
May. However  this is a crucial  decision  and it is important  that the far­
mer should  be conscious  of the implications  of changing  this percentage.  
If at the stocking  rate of 1.25 L.U. per acre the farmer  decided  to con­
serve 50% of the area rather  than 45%, the net effect  on stocking  press ­
ure on the grazed  area is to increase  it from 2.27 to 2.50. This is equiv ­
alent to an increase  of 23 cows per 100 acres. In some  situations  this 
increased  stocking  rate may be too high and may result  in an excessive  
reduction  in yield per cow. Similarly,  if grazing  pressure  is too high on 
a 20 paddock  farm the release  of one of the silage  paddocks  to the graz­
ing area means  that the stocking  rate is reduced  from 2.27 to 2.08 i.e. a 
reduction  of 19 cows per 100 acres which  in most circumstances  will be 
sufficient  to overcome  a temporary  slow period of grass growth.
Second  Silage  Cut
When the first silage area (45% of the farm) is closed  in mid-April  it 
can be cut on June 1 and followed  immediately  with a second  cut on 
30% of the total farm area. This 30% should  be taken  from that part 
of the farm from which the first cut was taken. The stocking  rate dur­
ing the second  cut is 1.75 cows per acre which it is possible  to take 
without  reducing  yields per cow. When  the second  cut of silage is tak­
en in late July the total farm area is grazed  until late November.  A 
yield of 9 and 6 tons per acre from the first and second  cuts respective ­
ly ensures  4.6 tons per cow for the winter  period. This is sufficient  for 
the Moorepark  winter  of 110 days.
Kilmeaden  Calendar  and Results.
This calendar  method  of operation  was fairly rigidly  observed  in the 
1973 experiment  (at Kilmeaden)  which compared  two levels  of nitrog ­
en (Table 10). The experiment  examined  a range of stocking  rates  
from 0.96 to 1.58 cows per acre. The only deviation  from the suggest ­
ed calendar  was that the cutting  date for the first silage cut was one 
week late and consequently  the cutting  date of the second  silage was a 
week late also. The yields  obtained  where 200 lb N was used are out­
lined in Table 11 where stocking  rates of 0.96, 1.19 and 1.33 cows per 
acre were compared.  The stocking  rates during  the first silage cut rang­
ed from 1.9 to 2.41 cows per acre and during  the second  silage cut 
from 1.43 to 1.82 cows per acre. There  was no effect  on yield per cow 
which averaged  693 gallons.

Nitrogen  Usage
Using 200 lb N per acre permits  an increase  in stock carrying  capac ­
ity of 30%. The use of higher  nitrogen  applications  to further  increase  
stocking  rates is being researched.  In Moorepark  it was previously  
shown  that increasing  the nitrogen  level above  the 200 lb per acre level 
did not permit  a further  increase  in stock carrying  capacity  when bull­
ocks were used. An experiment  designed  to examine  the response  for 
dairying  commenced  at the Kilmeaden  field station  in 1973 (Table  12). 
Two nitrogen  levels were compared  at three stocking  rates. On all 
treatments  nitrogen  was applied  in January  for the first grazing  and 
thereafter  three  of the farmlets  received  1 cwt of 26% N after every  sec­
ond grazing. The total nitrogen  usage in this case was 230 Ib/acre. On 
the remaining  three farmlets  1 cwt of 26% N was used after every graz­
ing which is a total of 380 Ib/acre. The advantages  of the higher  nit­
rogen level at the comparable  stocking  rates of .84 and .75 were non­
significant. However  on the 380 lb N level the high stocking  rate of 
.63 or 158 cows per 100 acre did result  in a depression  per cow and in a 
depression  in silage yield. This information  suggests  that on perennial  
ryegrass  type swards  the use of higher levels of nitrogen  for stocking  
rates of up to 135 cows per 100 acres must be seriously  questioned  and 
the data available  to date would  not justify  a higher  usage  than 200 lb.

The intensively  stocked  dairy farmer  can only keep his nitrogen  app­
lication  rate at 200 lb by omitting  the application  of nitrogen  after cer­
tain grazings. The available  information  suggests  1 cwt of 26% N or 
equivalent  for the first grazing  (applied  in January)  and the same level 
of nitrogen  for the second  and third grazings. Afterwards  1 cwt N 
should  be used after every second  grazing. Obviously  if there  were per­
iods of severe  shortage  this N level may be increased  but this situation  
at stocking  rates up to 130 cows per 100 acres should  be a rare occurr ­
ence.
0.8 Management  Technique
As the 1973 Kilmeaden  results  show,  (Table  12) stocking  rates in ex­
cess of .8 (or 1.25 cows per acre) can be successfully  achieved  in certain  
situations. The management  implications  of stocking  at .7 or 1.43 
cows per acre are examined  in Table 13. If stocking  rates of 2.25 for 
the first and 1.75 for the second  silage cut cannot  be exceeded  then the 
amount  of silage available  will be 3 tons per cow. This is unlikely  to 
be sufficient  in most circumstances.  However,  if stocking  rates of 2.6 
i.e. 45% of the farm area closed,  can be achieved  in the first cut and 
2.04 cows (30% of the farm area) in the second,  then the silage avail ­
able per cow is increased  to 4.09 tons per cow. There are obviously  
some situations  in the south where  this target  can and has been achiev ­
ed by some of our more progressive  farmers.

Replacement  Rate Effect
The stocking  rate targets  suggested  have included  a percentage  re­
placement  rate of 25%. This replacement  rate is higher  than normal  so 
consequently  the targets  suggested  are conservative.  A reduction  in 
the percentage  replacement  rate from 20 to 15% means  that an extra 5 
cows can be carried. A 10% replacement  figure which is achievable 
with excellent  management  means  that an additional  13 cows per 100 
acres can be carried. Using this data the effect  of culling  low yielders  
on the overall increase  in herd performance  can be assessed. If on a 
self-contained  farm, only 15% of the herd needs  to be replaced  for dis­
ease and infertility  the option  of culling  low yielders  by increasing  the 
culling  percentage  to 20% can be considered.  An increase  in the cull­
ing percentage  from 15 to 20 means  that 5 fewer cows are milked.
Assuming  that the low yielders  culled milked  300 gallons  the replace­
ment heifers  entering  the herd must milk an average  of 570 gallons  to 
make the increased  culling  rate financially  attractive.  Conversely  if a 
farmer  can maintain  a 15% replacement  rate he would  be better  off to 
keep his 300 gallon cows if the heifers  coming  in milked  less than 570 
gallons.
Facilities  Required  and Labour  Productivity
The stock carrying  capacities  under discussion  are not possible  on 
the majority  of Irish dairy farms  without  major re-organisation  of road­
ways, paddocks  and buildings.  Progress  in this respect  has been slower  
than one would wish. Any attempt  to achieve  these stocking  rates  
even on small farms without  proper  facilities  can only lead to further  
hardship  and diminishes  the concept  of dairying  as an attractive  way of 
life. The recommendation  to improve  facilities  on a dairy farm is only 
relevant  if the additional  cost can be met from the increased  sales with­
out reducing  living standards. Although  the sum involved  is high 
(Table 14), it can be financed  on a longterm  basis from intensive  dairy  
farming  systems. The annual  cost of providing  these facilities  is now 
less than the cost of fertiliser. It must be looked  at in this light as an 
essential  input. Without  good facilities,  nationally  we would  probably  
never accept the concept  of one man handling  more than 40 cows  
whereas  with these facilities  the concept  of one man plus relief looking  
after 100 cows is a real possibility.  The latter viewpoint  is of course  
not very widely  held. The essential  facilities  required  on well-run  dairy  
farms are firstly a good milking  shed. The Moorepark  open-sided  shed 
with its absence  of steps, doors, feeders  and glass jars will satisfy  the 
requirement  on most dairy farms provided  the shed is built big enough 
the minimum  number  of units per man being  six with the possibility  of 
one man being able to handle  up to 10 when the occasion  demands.  A 
central  gravel or metal roadway  is absolutely  essential  and paddocks  are 
essential  to make management  easier. P. McFeely  is currently  looking  
at the advantages  of 30 paddock  system  versus  a 10 paddock  system 
and to date the milk yield advantage  in favour  of the 30 paddock  one 
day system  is quite small. The high stocking  rates achieved  have been 
achieved  at the Agricultural  Institute  stations  with 10-12 paddocks. 
Certainly  20 paddocks  will permit  a sufficient  degree  of management 
sophistication  for most situations.  Calving  boxes  are essential  as cow 
numbers  grow.
On a 100 acre farm the annual  repayment  of the total sum required  
of £13,300  for a 15 year period  with a 20% grant for a commercial  
farm is £17.14  per acre; on a development  farm with a 30% grant the 
annual repayment  is £1500  or £15 per acre. These  facilities  are essent ­
ial to attain these higher stocking  rates. The relevant  question  for 
farmers  contemplating  development  is whether  the amount  required  
for facilities  can be met together  with the finance  required  for stock.

Dairy Merit
One of the factors  which obviously  has a big effect on repayment  
capacity  is total sales per cow, i.e. the combination  of milk price, calf 
price, and most important  the gallonage  produced  per cow. Walshe's  
experiment  on dairy merit (Table  15) showed  that high merit cows re­
acted in the same way as low merit  cows to increased  stocking  pressure.  
High milk yields  per cow must be sought  as well as increased  stocking  
rate to maximise  returns. At present  milk prices  an increase  of 100 
gallons  per cow which is available  through  genetic  improvement  would  
provide  sufficient  finance  to fertilise  the intensively  stocked  farm. The 
top third of the Kilmeaden  herd in 1973 milked  850 gallons  per cow 
which at the high stocking  rates on which  they were carried  and an ex­
pected  price of 22p per gallon  represents  gross sales per acre for milk of 
£250;  certainly  something  to be aimed  for.

Increased  Stocking  Rates using some Purchased  Winter Feedstuffs.
In the past year experimentation  at the Curtins  farm at Moorepark  
examined  the possibility  of carrying  stocking  rates of 1.5 and 1.75 
cows per acre. The objective  was to design  a system  of management  
which would maximise  the amount  of silage which could be cut from  
these two stocking  rates without  depressing  per cow performance.  The 
results in Table 16 show that stocking  rates of 2.75 cows per acre for 
the first cut and 2.0 cows per acre for the second  cut has a significant
depressing  effect  on per cow production.  The silage  yields  were estimat ­
ed as 2.9, 4.7, 1.0 and 2.4 tons per cow on treatments  A, B, C and D 
respectively.  The shortfall  in winter  feed is supplied  by molasses,  a 
protein  supplement  and straw  diet designed  by T. Butler.

Economic  Analysis
Gross profit figures  were calculated  for a range  of farm sizes from 20 
to 200 acres with a range of stock carrying  capacities  of 0.66 cows per 
acre to 2.0 cows per acre. These data were computed  for a range in 
sales per cow of 130 - £250  per cow. The gross profit  figures  obtained  
for the stocking  rates, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 cows per acre for each of 
the following  sales per cow; £150, £170, £190 and £230 are shown  in 
Tables  17 and 18 for 50 and 100 acre farms  respectively.  From  these  
gross profit  figures  the total labour  charges  and the capital  and interest  
repayment  must be deducted.  This data has been computed  for curr­
ent prices including  the recent  30-35%  increase  in fertiliser  prices. Ni­
trogen level is increased  as stocking  rates are increased. The same  
nitrogen  level of 200 Ib/acre  is used on the 1.50 and the 1.25 stocking  
rates. The data assumes  that the farms  are self-sufficie.it  for winter  fed 
up to 1.25 cows per acre for a 120-day  winter. The 1.50 stocking  rate 
was calculated  at a 140-day  winter. A depreciation  figure of £25 per 
cow was used. The principal  findings  from Tables 17 and 18 are
(1) an increase  in gross profit  per acre as stocking  rate is increased  up 
to the 1.25 cows per acre level
(2) a decrease  in gross profit per acre if stocking  rate is further  in­
creased  to 1.50 cows per acre
(3) a striking  effect  of sales per cow on the gross profit  figure.

•Deduct  labour  + repayment
The effect  on gross profit of increasing  the stocking  rate from 0.66 
to 0.8; from 0.8 to 1.0 and from 1.0 to 1.25 cows per acre is given in 
Table 19 for a 100 acre farm. An increase  in the stocking  rate from  
0.66 to 1.25 cows per acre at £150 sales per cow increases  gross profit  
by £4,542,  rising to £9,206  when sales per cow reached  £230. The 
annual  repayment  charges  (assuming  the farmer  has to borrow)  and any 
increased  labour  charges  must be deducted  from these gross profit  fig­
ures. The figure for gross profit  less repayments  with cows valued  at 
£200 repaid over a 5 year period,  and with facilities  repaid  over a 15 
year programme  is shown  in Table 20. The data assumes  that the 100 
.acre farm is considered  a "development"  farm under  Directive  159. In­
creasing  stocking  rate from 0.66 to 1.25 cows per acre increases  gross  
profits by £1,255  at £150 sales per cow (labour  not deducted).  The 
figures  for gross profit less repayments  for a 100-acre  farm is consider ­
ed a "commercial"  farm are presented  in Table 21. The main differ ­
ence is that there  is no subsidy  on livestock  purchases  for the "commer ­
cial" farm. The gross profit  increases  are reasonable  but the high inter ­
est rates and the short term availability  of finance  for the "developi-  
ment" are making  things unduly  difficult  for "commercial"  farmers.  
The implications  of increasing  the term for livestock  borrowing  from 5 
to 10 years at two values  for cows is shown  in Table  22. At the £200  
level increasing  the term from 5 years to 10 years  reduces  the annual  re­
payment  by £2,409  on the "commercial"  farm.

The repayment  schedule  which a farmer  has to meet if he is chang ­
ing from a different  farming  system  to intensive  dairying  at 1.25 cows  
per acre on 100 acres is high (Table  22). In such a case it is imperative  
that the livestock  money  should  be borrowed  for a 10 year period.
Conclusions.
The attractiveness  of dairying  in 1974 can be improved  for many 
Irish dairy farmers. The cost of good facilities  borrowed  long term can 
be financed  from the profits  of intensive  dairying. The availability  of 
long term finance  is necessary  to accelerate  intensification.  Calendar  - 
based management  plans permit the achievement  of higher stocking  
rates with minimum  difficulty. Higher  yielding  cows are essential  to 
improve  the financial  returns  and to provide  sufficient  income  to pay 
relief staff thereby  permitting  reasonable  time off. With these improve ­
ments dairying  in 1974 and succeeding  years can be an attractive  and 
financially  rewarding  Farm Enterprise.

FIFTH RICHARDS-ORPEN  MEMORIAL  LECTURE
DAIRY FARMING  SYSTEMS  1974
by
D. BROWNE
National  Dairying  Research  Centre,  Moorepark,  Fermoy.
Introduction
Mr. Chairman,  ladies and gentlemen,  it is my pleasure  to present  
the 5th Richards-Orpen  Memorial  Lecture  and I would like to thank  
the trustees  for their very kind invitation  to do so. In this presentat ­
ion dairy farming  systems  which are applicable  to 1974 conditions  will 
be discussed.  These systems  are combinations  of the thinking  and 
practice  of progressive  dairy farmers,  together  with the ideas and dev­
elopments  which have come from Moorepark  and its field stations  over 
the past 15 years. This 15 year period  has been characterised  by many  
desirable  changes  in the whole  structure  of the diary industry.  Amongst  
the significant  developments  have been:(1)  a more general  acceptance  
of increased  stock-carrying  capacity  on individual  dairy farms which  
has resulted  in a substantial  increase  in the national  cow herd and
(2) a much greater  degree  of rationalisation  in the creamery  structure.  
These developments  must continue  if we are to increase  our compet ­
itiveness.
At farm level there is considerable  potential  for improvement  in the 
organisation  of the work load so that more cows can be carried  with a 
reduced  work load. Good organisation  means  good stock  control,  and 
a management  system  whereby  key decisions  can be made with minimal  
effort. To achieve  this a calendar  based system  for the key manage ­
ment decisions  is proposed.
Dairying  on wet land.
The Mullinahone  field station provided  by Mullinahone  Co-op.  is 
being used to develop  dairying  systems  for wet land conditions.  One-  
third of the Mullinahone  farm is classified  as free-draining;  one-third  is 
imperfectly  drained;  and the remaining  third is poorly-drained.  This 
farm is considered  to be representative  of approximately  35% of the 
land used for dairying  in the Republic.  The farm was drained  to Land  
Project  specifications  and a central  farm roadway  laid on the grass sur­
face. The total area was fenced  into four farmlets,  each farmlet  having 
a proportion  of each soil type. On two of the farmlets,  nitrogen  usage  
was confined  to the silage area while on the remaining  two 200 lb nit­
rogen per acre per annum  was used. The milk yields  in the 71, 72 and 
73 seasons  are given in Table 1. All herds were spring  calving;  calving  
commenced  in late January  and in all years the shed was closed for 
4-6 weeks from early December.  During  the winter period all herds  
were self-fed  on silage cut from their respective  farmlets.  The annual 
meal supplementation  averaged  200 lb per cow.

At both nitrogen  levels increasing  the stocking  rate reduced  milk 
yield per cow in all years with one exception  in 1973 on the low nit­
rogen level. Neither  stocking  rate nor nitrogen  level affected  the fat 
content. However,  protein  content  on the high stocked  low nitrogen  
herd was significantly  depressed.  The milk yield of the low S.R./high  N 
group was significantly  higher  than that of low S.R./low  N groups.
This has been a consistent  feature  of the Mullinahone  results. The 
mean results for 1971-1973  period  are shown  in Table 2. On average,  
increasing  stocking  rates on the low nitrogen  farms decreased  pro­
duction  per cow by 58 gallons  or 9% but increased  production  per acre 
by 72 gallons. On the high N farms increasing  the stocking  rate from  
1.1 to 0.88 acres pmr cow significantly  decreased  milk yield per cow 
but marginally  increased  milk yield per acre. These  results  suggest  that 
on this type of land a stocking  rate of 1.0/cow  to 1.3 acres is possible  
with low nitrogen  usage. Where 200 lb of N is used a stock carrying  
capacity  of 1 cow per acre is possible.

Calendar  Blueprint  for wet land.
The calendar  of operations  necessary  to achieve  a stocking  rate of
1 cow per acre (on a 100 acre farm) is outlined  in Table 3. The foll­
owing  herd management  recommendations  are proposed:
(1) calving  should  begin towards  the end of January;
(2) calved  cows should  be fed 8 lb meal (15% protein)  per head per 
day in addition  to ad lib silage;
(3) the milking  cows should  be on grass by April 1, the dry cows re­
maining  on self-fed  silage;
(4) the first paddocks  grazed should be those from which it is in­
tended  to cut silage. The main limitation  to grazing  before  April  
1 is the risk of excessive  poaching.  Serious  poaching  has not 
occured  after April 1 on the Mullinahone  farm since operations  
began there in 1966. When grazing  commences  on April 1, the 
second  round  of grazing  will usually  begin around  April 20. Pad- 
docks are closed  for silage after second  grazing;  it is necessary  to 
close 45% of the total farm area to achieve  the proposed  target.  
At the overall  stocking  rate of 1 cow per acre the actual  stocking  
rate on the grazed  area during  this first silage cut is 1.8 cows or 
livestock  units per acre. It is possible  to carry this stocking  rate 
where  nitrogen  is used without  any significant  depression  in milk 
yield per cow.
(5) The first silage cut is usually  taken around  June 10 and is follow ­
ed by a second  cut of silage from 30% of the farm area which  
is being cut for the second  time. The stocking  rate on the grazed  
area during  the second  silage period  is 1.4 cows/acre.  It is also 
possible  to achieve  this stocking  rate without  depression  in milk 
yield per cow. When the second  cut has been taken the total 
area is grazed  at the overall  stocking  rate of 1 livestock  unit p)er 
acre until late November.  Silage yields  of 9 tons and 6 tons per 
acre from cuts 1 and 2, respectively,  provide  5.85 tons per cow 
which is more than adequate  for the Mullinahone  winter  which  
is usually  about 130 days.

Dairying  on free-draining  land.
Research  results from Moorepark  and from the Kilmeaden  field 
station  owned  by Waterford  Co-op.  are used to develop  dairying systems  
for free-draining  land. The results obtained  in the Kilmeaden  field 
station  for 1971-1972  (Tables  4 and 5) are typical  results  for free-drain ­
ing land situations.  On both nitrogen  levels increasing  stocking  rate 
significantly  reduced  milk yield per cow. There were no significant  
differences  between  nitrogen  levels at the low or at the high stock ­
ing rates. On both nitrogen  levels increasing  stocking  rate increased  
production  per acre. From these and other data we conclude  that 
where low levels of nitrogen  are used a target  of 1 cow to 1.1 acre is 
possible;  where 200 lb of nitrogen  per acre is used a target  of 1.25 cows  
per acre is possible.

Calendar  Blueprint  for dry land (low N).
A calendar  of operations  for a free draining  farm receiving  a low
level of nitrogen  is outlined  in Table 6. The stocking  rate proposed  is
75 cows and replacements  (25%) on 100 acres i.e. 1.06 acres per cow.
The principal  recommendations  to achieve  this target  are;
(1) calving  begins  in mid-January
(2) calved  cows fed 8 lb meal as per P. Gleesons  recommendation
(3) grazing  begins  in early March
(4) the key decision  influencing  the quantity  of silage is made in 
mid-April.  Adequate  silage can be obtained  if 45% of the total 
farm area is closed  for the first and only silage cut. This means  
that the stocking  rate on the grazed  portion  of the farm is 1.69 
L.U./acre.  A yield of 9 tons/acre  from  this cut will provide  4.35 
tons per cow. A second  silage option  is possible.  This proposes  
35% of the total farm area for the first cut and a resultant  stock ­
ing rate of 1.43 L.U./acre  followed  by a second  cut/from  15 per­
cent of the total farm area. Yields  of 9 and 6 tons from the 
first and second cuts respectively,  also provides  4.35 tons per 
cow. Farmers  who are farming  at this stocking  rate should  aim 
to get all their silage from the first cut. In the event of the re­
sulting  stocking  rate proving  too high in certain  seasons  a port­
ion of the area reserved  for silage (15 acres) could be released  
for grazing  and used for a second  cut.

The important  management  decisions  to carry 1 cow -r replace­
ments (25%) on one acre of land are incorporated  on a calendar  basis in 
Table 7. The overall  stocking  rate is 1 cow to 0.8 acres (1.25  cows per 
acre). It is suggested  for the creamery  herd that calving  begins  in mid-
January. The calved cows are fed silage + 8 lb meal per day as per 
P. Gleeson's  recommendation;  the dry cows are fed silage only.  
Gleesons  work at Moorepark  has shown  quite clearly  that dry cows can 
be adequately  maintained  on reasonable  quality  self-fed  silage.

Too much mental  effort  is used in making  this decision  and in gener ­
al people  tend to be far too conservative  in their attitude  to putting  
cows on to grass early. The advantages  of putting  the calved  cows out 
to grass early in March are:
(1) Milk yield per cow increases  when the cows go on to grass even 
when there is little grass available,  or perhaps  I should  say when 
there appears  to be little grass available.
(2) Concentrate  feeding  can be stopped  so the combination  of reduc ­
ed concentrate  feeding  and increased  milk yields  result  in increas­
ed income  to the farmer.
(3) Having  cows on grass eases the work load. Cows  are cleaner  and 
consequently  easier  to milk.
(4) Lastly, but most importantly,  putting  the cows out early in 
March has no ill-effects  on total grass growth. McFeely  has 
shown  this for the past 3 years (Tables  8 and 9). Three  dates of 
first grazing  were compared,  March 7th, March  28th, April 19th;  
and they were compared  with no nitrogen  applied  (Table  8) with 
40 lb N per acre per grazing (Table 9). In both cases even 
though they were significant  differences  in the amount  of dry 
matter  harvested  in each of the three first grazings,  there  was no 
effect in total dry matter  produced  up to the end of June under  
both systems. These  data strongly  support  the recommendation
for an early start to grazing  on the dairy farm. To ease the total 
management  burden  we would  suggest  that the milking  cows are 
put on to grass early in March  irrespective  of apparent  amount  of 
grass available  for them.

First Silage  Cut
On free-draining  farms where  grazing  starts  early the paddocks  from  
which silage will be cut are the last paddocks  to be grazed in the first 
rotation. When  these  paddocks  are grazed  for the second  time they are 
closed  and fertilised  for silage. This should  happen  between  the 10th 
and 24th of April. This is a crucial  decision  and it is best made on a 
calendar  basis. If one waits for surplus  feed conditions  one will invari ­
ably find that it is too late and that the first cut of silage cannot  be tak­
en until mid-June.  This disrupts  the whole  system  and results  in poorer  
silage quality.  The key to farming  1 cow to 0.8 acres is to close a suffic ­
ient area for silage in mid-April.  If the resultant  stocking  rate is depress ­
ing milk yield then a portion  can be released  for grazing. It is not poss­
ible to do the reverse  successfully.  To over-winter  this stocking  rate of 
1.25 cows per acre on self-fed  silage requires  that 45% of the total farm  
area is closed  for the first cut. Where  45% is closed  the resulting  stock ­
ing rate on the grazed  area is 2.27 cows per acre. This stocking  rate is 
possible  during  the very active period  of grass growth  in late April and 
May. However  this is a crucial  decision  and it is important  that the far­
mer should  be conscious  of the implications  of changing  this percentage.  
If at the stocking  rate of 1.25 L.U. per acre the farmer  decided  to con­
serve 50% of the area rather  than 45%, the net effect  on stocking  press ­
ure on the grazed  area is to increase  it from 2.27 to 2.50. This is equiv ­
alent to an increase  of 23 cows per 100 acres. In some  situations  this 
increased  stocking  rate may be too high and may result  in an excessive  
reduction  in yield per cow. Similarly,  if grazing  pressure  is too high on 
a 20 paddock  farm the release  of one of the silage  paddocks  to the graz­
ing area means  that the stocking  rate is reduced  from 2.27 to 2.08 i.e. a 
reduction  of 19 cows per 100 acres which  in most circumstances  will be 
sufficient  to overcome  a temporary  slow period of grass growth.
Second  Silage  Cut
When the first silage area (45% of the farm) is closed  in mid-April  it 
can be cut on June 1 and followed  immediately  with a second  cut on 
30% of the total farm area. This 30% should  be taken  from that part 
of the farm from which the first cut was taken. The stocking  rate dur­
ing the second  cut is 1.75 cows per acre which it is possible  to take 
without  reducing  yields per cow. When  the second  cut of silage is tak­
en in late July the total farm area is grazed  until late November.  A 
yield of 9 and 6 tons per acre from the first and second  cuts respective ­
ly ensures  4.6 tons per cow for the winter  period. This is sufficient  for 
the Moorepark  winter  of 110 days.
Kilmeaden  Calendar  and Results.
This calendar  method  of operation  was fairly rigidly  observed  in the 
1973 experiment  (at Kilmeaden)  which compared  two levels  of nitrog ­
en (Table 10). The experiment  examined  a range of stocking  rates  
from 0.96 to 1.58 cows per acre. The only deviation  from the suggest ­
ed calendar  was that the cutting  date for the first silage cut was one 
week late and consequently  the cutting  date of the second  silage was a 
week late also. The yields  obtained  where 200 lb N was used are out­
lined in Table 11 where stocking  rates of 0.96, 1.19 and 1.33 cows per 
acre were compared.  The stocking  rates during  the first silage cut rang­
ed from 1.9 to 2.41 cows per acre and during  the second  silage cut 
from 1.43 to 1.82 cows per acre. There  was no effect  on yield per cow 
which averaged  693 gallons.

Nitrogen  Usage
Using 200 lb N per acre permits  an increase  in stock carrying  capac ­
ity of 30%. The use of higher  nitrogen  applications  to further  increase  
stocking  rates is being researched.  In Moorepark  it was previously  
shown  that increasing  the nitrogen  level above  the 200 lb per acre level 
did not permit  a further  increase  in stock carrying  capacity  when bull­
ocks were used. An experiment  designed  to examine  the response  for 
dairying  commenced  at the Kilmeaden  field station  in 1973 (Table  12). 
Two nitrogen  levels were compared  at three stocking  rates. On all 
treatments  nitrogen  was applied  in January  for the first grazing  and 
thereafter  three  of the farmlets  received  1 cwt of 26% N after every  sec­
ond grazing. The total nitrogen  usage in this case was 230 Ib/acre. On 
the remaining  three farmlets  1 cwt of 26% N was used after every graz­
ing which is a total of 380 Ib/acre. The advantages  of the higher  nit­
rogen level at the comparable  stocking  rates of .84 and .75 were non­
significant. However  on the 380 lb N level the high stocking  rate of 
.63 or 158 cows per 100 acre did result  in a depression  per cow and in a 
depression  in silage yield. This information  suggests  that on perennial  
ryegrass  type swards  the use of higher levels of nitrogen  for stocking  
rates of up to 135 cows per 100 acres must be seriously  questioned  and 
the data available  to date would  not justify  a higher  usage  than 200 lb.

The intensively  stocked  dairy farmer  can only keep his nitrogen  app­
lication  rate at 200 lb by omitting  the application  of nitrogen  after cer­
tain grazings. The available  information  suggests  1 cwt of 26% N or 
equivalent  for the first grazing  (applied  in January)  and the same level 
of nitrogen  for the second  and third grazings. Afterwards  1 cwt N 
should  be used after every second  grazing. Obviously  if there  were per­
iods of severe  shortage  this N level may be increased  but this situation  
at stocking  rates up to 130 cows per 100 acres should  be a rare occurr ­
ence.
0.8 Management  Technique
As the 1973 Kilmeaden  results  show,  (Table  12) stocking  rates in ex­
cess of .8 (or 1.25 cows per acre) can be successfully  achieved  in certain  
situations. The management  implications  of stocking  at .7 or 1.43 
cows per acre are examined  in Table 13. If stocking  rates of 2.25 for 
the first and 1.75 for the second  silage cut cannot  be exceeded  then the 
amount  of silage available  will be 3 tons per cow. This is unlikely  to 
be sufficient  in most circumstances.  However,  if stocking  rates of 2.6 
i.e. 45% of the farm area closed,  can be achieved  in the first cut and 
2.04 cows (30% of the farm area) in the second,  then the silage avail ­
able per cow is increased  to 4.09 tons per cow. There are obviously  
some situations  in the south where  this target  can and has been achiev ­
ed by some of our more progressive  farmers.

Replacement  Rate Effect
The stocking  rate targets  suggested  have included  a percentage  re­
placement  rate of 25%. This replacement  rate is higher  than normal  so 
consequently  the targets  suggested  are conservative.  A reduction  in 
the percentage  replacement  rate from 20 to 15% means  that an extra 5 
cows can be carried. A 10% replacement  figure which is achievable 
with excellent  management  means  that an additional  13 cows per 100 
acres can be carried. Using this data the effect  of culling  low yielders  
on the overall increase  in herd performance  can be assessed. If on a 
self-contained  farm, only 15% of the herd needs  to be replaced  for dis­
ease and infertility  the option  of culling  low yielders  by increasing  the 
culling  percentage  to 20% can be considered.  An increase  in the cull­
ing percentage  from 15 to 20 means  that 5 fewer cows are milked.
Assuming  that the low yielders  culled milked  300 gallons  the replace­
ment heifers  entering  the herd must milk an average  of 570 gallons  to 
make the increased  culling  rate financially  attractive.  Conversely  if a 
farmer  can maintain  a 15% replacement  rate he would  be better  off to 
keep his 300 gallon cows if the heifers  coming  in milked  less than 570 
gallons.
Facilities  Required  and Labour  Productivity
The stock carrying  capacities  under discussion  are not possible  on 
the majority  of Irish dairy farms  without  major re-organisation  of road­
ways, paddocks  and buildings.  Progress  in this respect  has been slower  
than one would wish. Any attempt  to achieve  these stocking  rates  
even on small farms without  proper  facilities  can only lead to further  
hardship  and diminishes  the concept  of dairying  as an attractive  way of 
life. The recommendation  to improve  facilities  on a dairy farm is only 
relevant  if the additional  cost can be met from the increased  sales with­
out reducing  living standards. Although  the sum involved  is high 
(Table 14), it can be financed  on a longterm  basis from intensive  dairy  
farming  systems. The annual  cost of providing  these facilities  is now 
less than the cost of fertiliser. It must be looked  at in this light as an 
essential  input. Without  good facilities,  nationally  we would  probably  
never accept the concept  of one man handling  more than 40 cows  
whereas  with these facilities  the concept  of one man plus relief looking  
after 100 cows is a real possibility.  The latter viewpoint  is of course  
not very widely  held. The essential  facilities  required  on well-run  dairy  
farms are firstly a good milking  shed. The Moorepark  open-sided  shed 
with its absence  of steps, doors, feeders  and glass jars will satisfy  the 
requirement  on most dairy farms provided  the shed is built big enough 
the minimum  number  of units per man being  six with the possibility  of 
one man being able to handle  up to 10 when the occasion  demands.  A 
central  gravel or metal roadway  is absolutely  essential  and paddocks  are 
essential  to make management  easier. P. McFeely  is currently  looking  
at the advantages  of 30 paddock  system  versus  a 10 paddock  system 
and to date the milk yield advantage  in favour  of the 30 paddock  one 
day system  is quite small. The high stocking  rates achieved  have been 
achieved  at the Agricultural  Institute  stations  with 10-12 paddocks. 
Certainly  20 paddocks  will permit  a sufficient  degree  of management 
sophistication  for most situations.  Calving  boxes  are essential  as cow 
numbers  grow.
On a 100 acre farm the annual  repayment  of the total sum required  
of £13,300  for a 15 year period  with a 20% grant for a commercial  
farm is £17.14  per acre; on a development  farm with a 30% grant the 
annual repayment  is £1500  or £15 per acre. These  facilities  are essent ­
ial to attain these higher stocking  rates. The relevant  question  for 
farmers  contemplating  development  is whether  the amount  required  
for facilities  can be met together  with the finance  required  for stock.

Dairy Merit
One of the factors  which obviously  has a big effect on repayment  
capacity  is total sales per cow, i.e. the combination  of milk price, calf 
price, and most important  the gallonage  produced  per cow. Walshe's  
experiment  on dairy merit (Table  15) showed  that high merit cows re­
acted in the same way as low merit  cows to increased  stocking  pressure.  
High milk yields  per cow must be sought  as well as increased  stocking  
rate to maximise  returns. At present  milk prices  an increase  of 100 
gallons  per cow which is available  through  genetic  improvement  would  
provide  sufficient  finance  to fertilise  the intensively  stocked  farm. The 
top third of the Kilmeaden  herd in 1973 milked  850 gallons  per cow 
which at the high stocking  rates on which  they were carried  and an ex­
pected  price of 22p per gallon  represents  gross sales per acre for milk of 
£250;  certainly  something  to be aimed  for.

Increased  Stocking  Rates using some Purchased  Winter Feedstuffs.
In the past year experimentation  at the Curtins  farm at Moorepark  
examined  the possibility  of carrying  stocking  rates of 1.5 and 1.75 
cows per acre. The objective  was to design  a system  of management  
which would maximise  the amount  of silage which could be cut from  
these two stocking  rates without  depressing  per cow performance.  The 
results in Table 16 show that stocking  rates of 2.75 cows per acre for 
the first cut and 2.0 cows per acre for the second  cut has a significant
depressing  effect  on per cow production.  The silage  yields  were estimat ­
ed as 2.9, 4.7, 1.0 and 2.4 tons per cow on treatments  A, B, C and D 
respectively.  The shortfall  in winter  feed is supplied  by molasses,  a 
protein  supplement  and straw  diet designed  by T. Butler.

Economic  Analysis
Gross profit figures  were calculated  for a range  of farm sizes from 20 
to 200 acres with a range of stock carrying  capacities  of 0.66 cows per 
acre to 2.0 cows per acre. These data were computed  for a range in 
sales per cow of 130 - £250  per cow. The gross profit  figures  obtained  
for the stocking  rates, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 cows per acre for each of 
the following  sales per cow; £150, £170, £190 and £230 are shown  in 
Tables  17 and 18 for 50 and 100 acre farms  respectively.  From  these  
gross profit  figures  the total labour  charges  and the capital  and interest  
repayment  must be deducted.  This data has been computed  for curr­
ent prices including  the recent  30-35%  increase  in fertiliser  prices. Ni­
trogen level is increased  as stocking  rates are increased. The same  
nitrogen  level of 200 Ib/acre  is used on the 1.50 and the 1.25 stocking  
rates. The data assumes  that the farms  are self-sufficie.it  for winter  fed 
up to 1.25 cows per acre for a 120-day  winter. The 1.50 stocking  rate 
was calculated  at a 140-day  winter. A depreciation  figure of £25 per 
cow was used. The principal  findings  from Tables 17 and 18 are
(1) an increase  in gross profit  per acre as stocking  rate is increased  up 
to the 1.25 cows per acre level
(2) a decrease  in gross profit per acre if stocking  rate is further  in­
creased  to 1.50 cows per acre
(3) a striking  effect  of sales per cow on the gross profit  figure.

•Deduct  labour  + repayment
The effect  on gross profit of increasing  the stocking  rate from 0.66 
to 0.8; from 0.8 to 1.0 and from 1.0 to 1.25 cows per acre is given in 
Table 19 for a 100 acre farm. An increase  in the stocking  rate from  
0.66 to 1.25 cows per acre at £150 sales per cow increases  gross profit  
by £4,542,  rising to £9,206  when sales per cow reached  £230. The 
annual  repayment  charges  (assuming  the farmer  has to borrow)  and any 
increased  labour  charges  must be deducted  from these gross profit  fig­
ures. The figure for gross profit  less repayments  with cows valued  at 
£200 repaid over a 5 year period,  and with facilities  repaid  over a 15 
year programme  is shown  in Table 20. The data assumes  that the 100 
.acre farm is considered  a "development"  farm under  Directive  159. In­
creasing  stocking  rate from 0.66 to 1.25 cows per acre increases  gross  
profits by £1,255  at £150 sales per cow (labour  not deducted).  The 
figures  for gross profit less repayments  for a 100-acre  farm is consider ­
ed a "commercial"  farm are presented  in Table 21. The main differ ­
ence is that there  is no subsidy  on livestock  purchases  for the "commer ­
cial" farm. The gross profit  increases  are reasonable  but the high inter ­
est rates and the short term availability  of finance  for the "developi-  
ment" are making  things unduly  difficult  for "commercial"  farmers.  
The implications  of increasing  the term for livestock  borrowing  from 5 
to 10 years at two values  for cows is shown  in Table  22. At the £200  
level increasing  the term from 5 years to 10 years  reduces  the annual  re­
payment  by £2,409  on the "commercial"  farm.

The repayment  schedule  which a farmer  has to meet if he is chang ­
ing from a different  farming  system  to intensive  dairying  at 1.25 cows  
per acre on 100 acres is high (Table  22). In such a case it is imperative  
that the livestock  money  should  be borrowed  for a 10 year period.
Conclusions.
The attractiveness  of dairying  in 1974 can be improved  for many 
Irish dairy farmers. The cost of good facilities  borrowed  long term can 
be financed  from the profits  of intensive  dairying. The availability  of 
long term finance  is necessary  to accelerate  intensification.  Calendar  - 
based management  plans permit the achievement  of higher stocking  
rates with minimum  difficulty. Higher  yielding  cows are essential  to 
improve  the financial  returns  and to provide  sufficient  income  to pay 
relief staff thereby  permitting  reasonable  time off. With these improve ­
ments dairying  in 1974 and succeeding  years can be an attractive  and 
financially  rewarding  Farm Enterprise.

An area of approximately  300,000  acres is sown to grass each year in 
Ireland. Ryegrasses  are by far the most important herbage  grass sown 
and they are the mainstay  of reseeded  Irish pastures. Perennial  rye­
grass is undoubtedly  the predominant  species  and in 1973 accounted  
for 62.0%  of the total seed used. Italian  and hybrid  ryegrasses  are also 
used to quite a large extent  and their seed tonnage  reached  about  25% 
of the total sown in 1973. Table 1 shows  the amounts  of seed of grass  
and legume  herbage  species  used in 1973.

In 1973 the amount  of home produced  seed of perennial  ryegrass  
was only half that of 1971. This is a consequence  of Ireland's  entry to 
the E.E.C. and indicates  that farmers  prefer the more sophisticated  
varieties  bred in other  countries.
PERENNIAL  RYEGRASS
The varieties  of perennial  ryegrass  presently  grown in this country  
are divided  into three groups  according  to time of heading  (Tables  2, 
3 and 4). Some  varieties  were recently  re-named  and the old names  are 
given in brackets.  All varieties  with (T) are tetraploids.

The varieties  in Table 2 produce  more herbage  in spring than those  
in the other Tables  but are normally  less pjersistent.  The old varieties 
Aberystwyth  S.24 and Grasslands  Ruanui  have a relatively  good persist ­
ence. The new medium  early varieties  Cropper  and Premo  although  
producing  less spring  growth  than S.24 and Ruanui  are more persistent  
and give higher  total yields under  a frequent  defoliation  regime. Our 
new variety  Oakpark  is also a medium  early type and performed  as well 
as Premo  in trials conducted  at Loughgall.  The varieties  in this group  
are suitable  for leys of medium  duration  where  early growth  is required.- 
They also give a good first silage cut about the third week in May.

The varieties  in this group  are in general  more persistent  than those  
of the early group. Some of them such as. Combi,  Glasnevin  Leafy,
Scotia,  Talbot  and Taptoe  combine  a good persistence  with an erect 
growth  habit  which  makes  them suitable  for conservation.

Late heading  is normally  associated  with late spring growth,  pros­
trate growth  habit,  leafiness  in summer  grazing  and high level of persist ­
ence. These  varieties  are more  suited  to long term leys. Variety  Spirit  
with a more erect growth  habit than most late flowering  perennial  rye­
grasses  is particularly  suitable  for conservation.  This variety  has per­
formed  extremely  well in large scale experiments  conducted  at Oakpark  
as will be mentioned  later. The late types  are more resistant  to poach ­
ing than those in the other groups  and therefore  are recommended  in 
areas of high rainfall  and difficult  soil conditions  such as the Drumlin  
regions.
Figures  1 and 2 show the difference  between  the patterns  of growth  
of the early and late groups.
The tetraploid  varieties  mentioned  were all bred in the Netherlands.  
They are 1-2% lower in dry matter  content  and have a slower  rate of 
drying  than the diploids. They have a consistently  higher  soluble  car­
bohydrate  content  and are slightly  more  digestible.  These  varieties  are 
a little later in spring  growth  than their diploid  counterparts  and are 
generally  less persistent  under grazing  in pure stands  but compete  well 
with other grasses  in mixtures. The tetraploids  are more palatable  to 
stock, particularly  in summer  and autumn. Their  seeds are larger  than 
those  of diploids.

ITALIAN  AND HYBRID  RYEGRASSES
Italian ryegrass ’ is a short-lived  grass used in short leys, or in seed 
mixtures  for leys of longer duration. It has a long growing  season  
combined  with the ability to produce  good crops of silage and hay. 
Output  in the first harvest  year is normally  unsurpassed  by any of the 
other ryegrass  species  particularly  when sown in autumn. The varieties 
of Italian ryegrass  sown in Ireland are divided  into two groups,  as 
shown below.

All these varieties  are earlier  in spring  growth  than any of the per­
ennial ryegrasses  and head about  two weeks  later than S.24. They pro­
vide an "early bite" of great value to the dairy farmer. Thus, under  
the Irish conditions  an early bite in February/March  can produce  an in­
crease of%to1  gallon of milk/cow/day.  Among  the varieties  mention ­
ed, Lemtal,  better known  as R.V.P.  Italian,  excels  all the others  in per­
sistence  and winter  hardiness.  This variety  is able to survive  for at least 
three  years as will be shown  later.
Grasslands  Manawa  (formerly  named  H.1) is the only variety  of hy­
brid ryegrass  sown in Ireland. It is a hybrid  between  perennial  and 
Italian ryegrass  and was bred in New Zealand. It has some of the out- 
of-season  growth  of Italian ryegrass  combined  with some of the persist ­
ence and sward  density  of perennial  ryegrass.  This variety  is extremely  
susceptible  to winter  kill in cold areas. A new tetraploid  hybrid  rye­
grass called Sabrina,  produced  by the Welsh  Plant Breeding  Station,  will 
soon be available  on the Irish market.
The main characteristics  of tetraploid  Italian and hybrid  ryegrass  in 
relation  to diploid  varieties  are similar  to those mentioned  for tetrap ­
loid varieties  of perennial  ryegrass.
SEED  MIXTURES
Ryegrasses  are sown in seeds mixtures  which normally  include  a 
herbage  legume. In Ireland  white clover is an inseparable  companion  
of ryegrass  in the great majority  of mixtures  sown. Seeds mixtures  
would  certainly  give a subject  for another  lecture. However,  I wish to
10
refer briefly  to them. Grass breeders  are more and more tailoring  their  
varieties  to specific  objectives  and managements  such as:
1. Grazing  under high stocking  rates and high levels of soil fertility
2. Production  of high yields  of conserved  grass of good quality  in 2- 
3 cuts
3. Increase  of early spring  growth
Consequently,  the old complex  mixtures  such as the well known  
Cockle  Park mixture,  based on a combination  of a number  of different  
grass and legume  herbage  species,  are rapidly  being replaced  by much 
simpler mixtures  more suitable  to be exploited  under the new and 
sophisticated  systems  of management.  A few examples  of mixtures  
adapted  to particular  systems  of management  and suitable  to be sown  
by Irish farmers  will now be presented.

ASSESSMENT  OF RYEGRASS  SILAGE  IN TERMS  OF 
ANIMAL  PRODUCTIVITY
Grass breeders  are often criticised  because  they normally  evaluate 
their varieties  on the basis of cutting  experiments  and not on animal  
productivity.  Therefore,  I am briefly  reporting  the evaluation  of three  
ryegrass  varieties  in terms  of beef prodjction.
Varieties  Spirit (Sceempter  Hay) and Oriel of perennial  ryegrass  and 
Lemtal  (R.V.P.)  of Italian  ryegrass  were undersown  with barley  in March  
1970 in large scale plots (1 ac) and have been compared  under  a 3 - cut 
silage management.  The main objective  of this experiment  is to guide  
the plant breeder  in the way to produce  ryegrass  varieties  suitable  for 
silage conservation.  The swards  received  439 kg/ha (3ya cwt/ac)  of 
0:10:20  fertiliser  at the end of December  or early in January  and a 
total of 280 kg/ha (250 Ib/ac) of N was applied  in 1971 and 358 kg/ha  
(319 Ib/ac) in 1972 and 1973. The first nitrogen  dressing  was applied  
in the middle of March and consisted  of 439 kg/ha (3y2 cwt/ac)  of
C.A.N.  (26%) and the other two applications  were carried  out after the 
first and second  cuts respectively.  The first cut was made when the 
herbage  had a D-value  not lower than 63, i.e. ten days to two weeks  
after mean ear emergence  for Oriel and around  mean ear emergence  for 
Lemtal  and Spirit. Second  and third harvests  were made 6 to 7 weeks  
after the first and second  cuts respectively.
Total yields of herbage  dry matter  produced  by 3 - silage cuts in 
1971,  1972 and 1973  are shown  in Fig. 3.

The depressive  effect  of this type of management  reported  by Green  
& Eyies (1960)  and Ribeiro  (1970)  in varieties  with low persistence  is 
particularly  evident  in the 1973 data for Oriel and Lemtal. Figure  4 
illustrates  the effect of this management  in variety  S.321 of perennial  
ryegrass.

The digestibility  of first cut herbages  was much lower  in 1972 than 
in 1971 which possibly  was a consequence  of the poor weather  condit ­
ions in May.
For each variety  the herbage  of each cut was ensiled  separately  in a 
"bun"  - silo. The herbage  was ensiled  without  wilting  and an additive  
containing  formic  acid was applied  to the herbage  of all cuts at the rate 
of 0.5 gallon/ton.
Total yields of silage and silage DM (t/ha) for 1971 and 1972 were  
as follows:

Oriel 47.0 48.7 10.5 11.8

All silages  were well preserved  with the exception  of first cut Oriel  
in 1972 which  had a 4.5 pH and 1.4% decomposed  protein.
The composition  of the silages  is given in Table  6.

The assessment  of the silages  in terms of beef production  was con­
ducted  for the first time in 1972. A feeding  experiment  was carried  
out in winter 1972-'73  in which 30 Friesian  bullocks  with an average  
liveweight  of 447 kg (872 cwt) were fed ad libitum  for 105 days with 
ryegrass  silage without  supplementation  but with access  to a salt lick. 
The animals  were randomised  and divided  into three groups  of 10 and 
fed as follows:
Group  1. 
Group  2. 
Group  3.Spirit  silage  
Oriel silage  
Lemtal  silage
In the first 45 days the animals  were fed first cut silages. They were 
then fed second  cut silages  for 32 days and in the last 28 days of the 
experiment  they were fed third cut silages. The mean intakes  of silage  
and dry matter  were:

T)ie mean efficiency  of feed conversion,  measured  as the kg live-

calculated  and the following  values  were obtained:

Spirit = 8.80  kg
Oriel = 5.34  kg
Lemtal = 6.13 kg
Finally  the number  of animals  fed with the silage produced  in 1 ac 
or 1 ha was estimated  and is given in Table  8.

In conclusion,  the results  of the feeding  experiment  show  that under  
the 1972 conditions,  the animals  fed with Spirit silage performed  sig­
nificantly  better than those fed with silages  of the other two ryegrass  
varieties.

GREAT  GRASS  
MAKES  A GREAT  
EXPORT  MESSAGE
This symbol  is now used in all promotions  for Irish  beef and 
lamb in our export  markets.  It was designed  after  consumer  
research  to discover  just what  housewives  abroad  thought  of 
Ireland  as a meat  producing  country.  And it is used with the 
theme:  “Great  Grass  Makes  Great  Beef  — Irish  Beef ”. 
Exports  of Irish livestock,  beef and lamb  set a record  in 
1973,  bringing  £172,000,000  into our economy,  and 
accounting  for approximately  one-fourth  of our total export  
trade.

Some aspects  of Silage Making  
and Feeding
V. Flynn,  Agricultural  Insititute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
Our livestock  industry  is going through  a period of tremendous  
growth  and expansion. Increase  in output  will improve  the nation's  
balance  of payments  and should  increase  farmers'  profits  provided  that 
the rate of increase  in costs is kept lower  than the rate of increase  in 
output.
Let us consider  briefly the trends in costs and returns  in intensive  
winter beef production  over the past three years. The costings  pub­
lished by I.M.P.  in 1970 are taken  as a base and compared  with costings 
for 1973 calculated  in exactly  the same way except  for the substitution  
of 1973 values  for 1970 values. The result  of this exercise  is summar ­
ised in Table 1.
Table 1. Costs  and returns  (£) per animal  for an intensive  system  of winter  beef 
production  in 1970 and in 1973.
1970 1973 % change
Total variable  costs 100.05 179.80 + 79.7
Total  overheads 7.75 13.85 + 78.7
Interest  on working  capital 4.10 9.88 + 141.0
Sales 120.75 210.00 ■t 73.9
Gross  output 44.75 66.00 -I- 47.5
Gross  margin 20.70 30.20 + 45.9
Nett margin 12.95 16.34 + 26.2
Nett margin  less interest 8.85 6.46 - 27.0
While total variable  costs, total overheads  and sales have increased  
by over 70% the gross output  and gross margin  have increased  by less 
than 50% and the nett margin  has increased  by only 26%, Furthermore  
interest  on working  capital  has more than doubled  and after allowing  
for interest  the nett margin  per animal  has actually  declined  by 27%.
These calculations  are of little relevance  if no expansion  is planned  
but they are very relevant  to farmers  who are commencing  intensive  
winter  beef production  or who are expanding  existing  wintering  enter ­
prises.
Against  this background  of rather  low nett margins  per animal  in in­
tensive  winter  beef production  it is necessary  to consider  the more im­
portant  aspects  of silage making  and feeding. Results  of feeding  trials  
are quoted  and interpreted  on an economic  basis. The main economic  
criterion  is "feed cost per cwt. liveweight  produced".  This feed cost
21
includes  the cost of fertilizers  and of harvesting,  the cost of silage  
additive  and of concentrate  supplement  where either  are used but do 
not include  rent, rates,  storage  or feeding  costs.
The major  aspects  to be discussed  are:
1. Yield
2. Quality  and supplementation
3. Preservation  (additives)
4. Efficiency  of conservation  (losses)
5. Wilting  and fine chopping
1. YIELD
Higher yield is desirable  in its own right because  of the desirability  
of optimising  output  per unit area of land. Associated  with it is the 
important  side effect that it spreads  harvesting  costs. Table 2 shows  
how increasing  yield from 4,000 to 4,700 lb. D.M./acre  by using 92 
rather  than 46 units of N. reduces  the harvesting  costs per ton of D.M.  
ensiled,  without  significantly  increasing  the total cost of feed per cwt. 
liveweight  gain. Because  of the higher  output  the margin  per acre over 
feed cost is substantially  increased  by the higher  yield.

2. QUALITY
We know from several sources,  e.g. the Department  of Agriculture  
and Fisheries  data (2), that most silage still has a low feeding  value.
The making  of low quality  silage incurs roughly  the same fertilizer  
and harvesting  costs as high quality  silage. Yet, more low quality  mat­
erial is required  to put on a unit of weight  gain, and furthermore  low
22
quality  material  sets a low ceiling  to the attainable  rate of gain in the 
absence  of supplementation.  Table 3 shows  how feed quality  express ­
ed as growth  promoting  potential  for stores  influences  the feed cost per 
cwt. liveweight  produced.  Likewise  nett margins  per acre are in favour  
of higher quality  silage even when the higher stock-carrying  capacity  
and a price rise is taken into account  as shown  in Table  4.

Concentrates  may be used to make up for poorer  quality  silage  
but barley  is at least four times  as expensive  as good silage. Thus,  feed­
ing any barley increases  the feed cost per cwt. liveweight  produced.  
Table 5 shows how the feeding  of barley to raise the growth  rate of 
store cattle to 2.0 lb. per day increases  the feed cost per cwt. liveweight  
gain.

silages  on the feed cost per cwt liveweight  gain

Feed cost per cwt. liveweight  gain is increased  substantially  by feed­
ing high levels of barley,  but it is only one element  of the total cost in-
23
volved  in wintering.  Profit in barley feeding  depends  mainly  on being  
paid more for the extra product  than what is paid for the barley.  
When fed at a rate of about  4 - 5 lb. per day with good quality  silage  to 
8 cwt. cattle every 8 lb. barley fed produces  about 1 lb. extra live- 
weight. Every 12 lb. barley produces  about 1 lb. carcase  under the 
same circumstances.  With poorer  quality  silage  the response  to barley  
feeding  should  be somewhat  better. Table  6 shows  the break-even  sell­
ing prices for beef at different  cost prices for barley fed at about  4 lb. 
per day with good and average  quality  silages.

If barley costing  £50 per ton is fed at 4 Ib./day  with good leafy sil­
age to finishing  cattle then selling  price must be at least £20 per cwt. 
liveweight  or 27p per lb. carcase  in order to break-even.  If it is fed 
with average  silage the minimum  sale price to break-even  is £17.50  per 
cwt. liveweight.
3. PRESERVATION  - ADDITIVES
Preservation  of silage is important  chiefly  because  it influences  in­
take and, consequently,  production.  Table 7 shows  intakes  and per­
formance  of cattle on well preserved  and badly preserved  September 
silages. In this case the difference  in preservation  was due solely  to the 
use of Vz gal formic  acid 85% per ton as an additive. Additive  use im­
proved  preservation,  intake,  weight  gain, carcase  weight  and feed con­
version. After  allowing  for the cost of the additive  the cost of feed per 
cwt. liveweight  gain was reduced  by additive  use.

Lb D.M. per lb liveweight  gain 9.8 13.3
Feed  cost per cwt liveweight  gain £6.50 £7.15
24
However,  a response  to the use of an additive  is not always  obtained.  
Table 8 shows  a case where  an additive  was used on late May grass but 
was not required  to give a good preservation.  Intake,  liveweight  gain,  
carcase  weight  and feed conversion  did not differ between  treatments.  
Feed cost per cwt. liveweight  gain was increased  in this case by additive  
use and no return was obtained  on the use of additive. Instead  the 
cost of the additive  resulted  in money  being  wasted.
Table  8. Effect of additive when used on grass not requiring additive

Carcase  weight  Lb 554 560
Lb D.M. per lb liveweight  gain 10.9 11.3
Feed  cost per cwt liveweight  gain £5.75 £4.75
Because  of this possibility  it is very important  to distinguish  be­
tween  the need for additive  and the waste  of additive.
An effective  additive  is required  only on lush leafy grass ensiled  in 
wet conditions,  particularly  if grown with high nitrogen. Stemmy  
grass should  not be treated.
Where an additive  is considered  necessary  the only additive  confid ­
ently recommended  at the present  time is 85% formic  acid. All of the 
other available  additives  are being  tested.
4. EFFICIENCY  OF CONSERVATION
This is very much dependent  on the over-all  standard  of manage ­
ment, particularly  on the attention  given to covering  the silo. If the 
silage is covered  so that air is completely  excluded  losses  in the silo will 
be quite low, 10% or less. As the standard  of covering  deteriorates,  
more air penetrates  and more silage rots on the surface  of the silo. The 
quantity  which rots can be as low as nil or as high as 50%. In good 
farm practice  and with good covering  total loss can be kept as low as 
15% but in many cases particularly  in outdoor  clamps  with badly  cover ­
ed sides the loss is often over 30%. Table  9 shows  the influence  of this 
avoidable  extra 15% loss on the feed cost per cwt. liveweight  gain and 
on a calculated  profit per acre from a good crop of leafy silage. In 
addition  to the effect  on feed cost it also reduces  total output  by 15%.  
Of course,  these  considerations  should  stress  the desirability  of efficient  
conservation.

5. WILTING
The wilting  of grass for silage is becoming  popular  in recent  years.  
The main reason  is that cutting and wilting  to some extent  is an integral  
part of a harvesting  system  using a fine chop harvester.  Wilting  has 
several  points  in its favour.
(a) It reduces  the load to be carried  from the field and reduces  
or eliminates  effluent. If a leafy crop is being cut at 17%
D.M. and wilted  to 25% the weight  to be carried  is reduced  by 
32%. Effluent  will be reduced  by about 30 gal per ton. 
However,  when an average  stemmy  crop is cut at 20% D.M. 
and wilted to 25% D.M. weight  to be carried  is reduced  by 
only 20% and effluent  is reduced  by about  15 gallons  per ton.
(b) Wilting  to 25% dry matter  means  that the quality  of the pre­
servation  will be good in nearly  all crops  without  additive  use. 
The most likely exception  would  be a crop which is very wet 
and low in sugar prior to cutting  (e.g. Autumn  grass). Theor ­
etically  wilting  to 25% D.M. can be regarded  as an alternative  
to using an additive  but this substitution  applies  only to grass  
which needs an additive  to preserve  well without  wilting. As 
was the case when considering  additives,  the preservation  of 
stemmy  crops generally  will not be improved  by wilting. Un­
aided  they preserve  well.
(c) Wilting  will increase  the amount  of feed that will fit in a silo 
of fixed volume  by up to 40%. This can be a considerable  
advantage  in circumstances  where extra silo capacity  in­
dependent  of animal  accommodation  is required  by an expan ­
sion programme.
In terms of animal  production  responses  to wilting  are not conclus ­
ive. Sometimes,  trials in which  intake  was increased  by wilting  showed  
no increase  in production.  Table 10 shows the averaged  results of 
many trials conducted  in several centres,  including  Grange,  in which  
wilted and unwilted  silages were compared. Because  both milk and 
beef animals  were used in those trials responses  are given as a percen ­
tage increase  over the unwilted  control.
26
Table  10. Animal  production  response  to wilting
Cattle pH of unwilted Increase  due
silage to wilting
Mature 4.1 -2.6%
Mature 5.0 29.8%
Weanlings 4.0 44.7%
Generally,  it appears  that many of the recorded  increases  due to 
wilting in production  by mature  animals  were obtained  in trials in 
which the unwilted  silage was badly preserved.  Most trials carried  out 
with cows and heavier  cattle in which the unwilted  silage  was well pre­
served did not show a response  to wilting. In contrast,  there were  
several  trials in which response  to wilting  were obtained  with weanling  
cattle even when the unwilted  silage was well preserved  and this is 
shown  in the third line of Table 10. The response  of 44% is inflated  by 
two rather high responses.  The average  response  obtained  in most of 
the Grange  trials with weanlings  was under  20%.
While better  performance  on wilted  silage has always  been attributed  
to the higher  dry matter  content  it can, in many cases,  be just as validly  
attributed  to better preservation.  Of course,  these two are related  in 
that drier grass is more likely to preserve  well but they are not insepar­
ably linked. It is important  to distinguish  between  the effect  of dry 
matter  content  per se and the effect  of preservation  per se. It appears  
that when preservation  is good (low NH3-N,  low butyric  acid low pH) 
dry matter  content has relatively  little influence  on intake  and perform ­
ance by mature  animals  over the range of D.M. content  usually  en­
countered.  But when low dry matter  content  is accompanied  by poor  
preservation,  intake and performance  is depressed.  This latter situat ­
ion is more likely to arise when a leafy wet crop is ensiled. Preservat ­
ion of stemmy  grass is less likely to be influenced  by dry matter  con­
tent and, consequently,  performance  on this material  is not likely  to be 
influenced  by wilting. This point has been borne out by Department  
of Agriculture  farm weighings  over the past few years in which the 
average  performance  of cattle fed on direct  cut and wilted  silages  has 
been similar.
In summary,  the wilting  of wet leafy grass which may not preserve  
well if ensiled  direct should  ensure good preservation  and good per­
formance. But wilting  the great bulk of the grass ensiled  in this 
country  cannot be expected  to improve  performance.
Difficulties  associated  with wilting  are its dependence  on good dry­
ing weather  and the involvement  of expensive  complex  machinery  
which may increase  the harvesting  cost to the farmer. A good measure  
of the drying  power  of the atmosphere  is Potential  Evaporation  (PE) as 
measured  by evaporation  of water  from an open pan (Class  A pan). It 
combines  the effects of temperature,  humidity,  wind and sunshine  in
27
one single  measurement.
In an efficient  high speed system  of making  wilted  silage the ideal 
wilting  period  should  be about 24 hours. Some  preliminary  records  at 
Grange  show that to raise the dry matter  content of a 10 ton leafy crop 
containing  17% D.M. at cutting  to about 25% (to ensure  satisfactory  
preservation)  requires  weather  conditions  to evaporate  about 2.5 mm 
water from the open pan. Evaporation  from an open pan of water  in a 
24 hour period  can vary from nil to over 7 mm. There  are many  days 
during the silage making  season during  which evaporation  is less than 
2.5 mm and, consequently,  many days during which a satisfactory  
degree  of wilting  in a leafy crop will not take place.
Table 11 shows  the average  number  of years out of 10 in which  you 
can expect  a series of 1, 2 or 4 consecutive  days  to have a PE of 2.5 or 
more at Lullymore  in late May, June/July,  August  and September.  It 
shows  clearly  that wilting  conditions  are worst  in late May, August  and 
September  when wilting is most needed  from the preservation  view ­
point. A farmer  with one days silage  work on a particular  date in late 
May is likely to succeed  in six years out of 10. However,  the farmer  
who wants  two consecutive  good days will succeed  only 3 - 4 years in 
10. This has serious  implications  for the consistent  making  of wilted  
leafy silage by contract.  Success  in wilting  stemmy  crops  will be much  
more frequent  partly because  stemmy  crops wilt easier and partly be­
cause wilting  condtons  are better  in mid summer  when  stemmy  crops 
are being harvested.

Problems  with the cost and operation  of machinery  for wilting  are 
for the contractor  rather than the farmer. However,  the harvesting 
cost per acre or per ton for wilted  silage relative  to direct  cut silage  is a 
figure  which is of relevence  to the farmer. If there is no difference  in 
cost/acre  between  single  or double  chop direct cut and precision  chopp ­
ed wilted  silage then clearly  the farmer  ought  to choose  to wiljforthe  
advantages  in confers  in terms of effluent  control  and increased  silo 
capacity. But if wilting costs more than direct cutting  then extra  
cost must be offset  against  the value of the advantages.  This value  will
28
vary widely  from one farm situation  to another. In one situation  the 
saving on additive  costs and the reduction  of effluent  and increase  in 
silo capacity  could postpone  the construction  of a new silo. In other  
situations,  however,  none of these points  may have any value. Table  
12 shows  how contract  harvesting  cost per acre, yield and feeding  value  
influence  a calculated  feed cost per cwt. liveweight  gain. As shown  in 
earlier tables yield and feeding  value are very important  determinants  
of feed cost. This table shows the contract  harvesting  charge  to be 
equally  important  particularly  if the yield and the feeding  value of the 
grass being  ensiled  is low.

SUMMARY  AND CONCLUSIONS
1, High Yields  of grass for silage are desirable  and are important  in 
keeping  feed cost at a reasonable  level.
2. High  Quality  is essential  to get high performance  with low cost.
3. Good Preservation  is essential  to exploit  the potential  of high 
quality  silage.
4. Avoidable  loss increases  costs and reduces  profits.
5. Wilting  has many management  advantages  but does not always  in­
crease  production.
6. Weather  conditions  make it very difficult  to consistently  exploit  
the advantages  of wilting,  except  in the case of the small-scale  
independent  operator.
7. High  Harvesting  costs can be borne only by high yields  of high 
quality  grass.

Introduction
In 1972 Irish farmers  spent £30.8 million  on fertilizers  which  was 
the second  largest  input after purchased  feeding  stuffs (£65.3  million)  
into agriculture  (1). With an overall increase  of 28% in sales from  
1971-72  to 1972-73  (2), it is estimated  that farmers  spent £39.4 mill­
ion on fertilizers  last year. These figures  reflect  a big expansion  in 
fertilizer  use over the years (Table 1) rather  than an increase  in prices  
(table 2).

From 1953 to 1973 nitorgen  usage  has increased.almost  twelve  fold,  
phosphorus  five fold and potassium  by six fold. There  was a steady  
rise in the use of N.P.K.  in the period 1953-66  but it was in 1967-68  
that dramatic  increases  in sales occurred,  especially  in nitrogen.  Trends  
in the livestock  numbers  were somewhat  similar. There was only a 
marginal  increase  for the period 1953-63  but since the introduction  of 
the heifer  subsidy  in 1964 there has been a big rise in numbers. Ob­
viously  the increased  use of fertilizers  followed  the rise in the feed de­
mands of stock.

* Irish Statistical  Bulletin 1953, 1963 and 1973
For 20 years,  1953-1973,  overall  prices  of fertilizers  did not increase.  
In fact prices  decreased  during  the late fifties  and early sixties  with the 
introduction  of subsidies  for phosphorus  and potassium  and the estab ­
lishment  of Nitrogen  Eireann  Teo. In 1954 one ton of sulphate  of 
amonia  cost £22.50  and in 1973 it cost £24.14  (2). Potassium  cost 
£20.50/ton  in 1954, £13.50/ton  in 1963  and £23 in 1972. Phosphorus 
which cost £12/ton  in 1953 cost £12.53  in 1972-73. In the same  
period the purchasing  power of the £ declined  to 40 per cent of its 
1953 value.
The Livestock  Price Index has lagged behind  the Consumer  Price  
Index for most of the 20 years. For ten years, 1953-63,  it showed  
little or no change  but since 1968 the gap between  the indexes  has 
narrowed  and in 1973, when  cattle  prices  were at a peak,  the Livestock  
Price Index was 40 points ahead of the Consumer  Price Index.
WHERE  FERTILIZERS  ARE USED
In 1972 the Fertilizer  Use Survey  showed  that three-quarters  of the 
total N and P and two-thirds  of K fertilizers  purchased  were spread  on 
grassland  (3). It is estimated  that grassland  farmers  spent  £22 million  
on fertilizers  in that year compared  to an estimated  £13.6 million  on 
purchased  feeding  stuffs for cows (£6.7m) and cattle (£6.8m). Fertil ­
izers are, therefore,  the biggest  single input by most farmers  into their  
enterprises.  There is little doubt  that in the past fertilizers  have been 
cheap. The new prices  projected  for 1974 i.e. £41-42/ton  of N (26%), 
£32-33/ton  of P (8%) and £37-38/ton  of K (50%)  could  however  revert  
the ratio of the Fertilizer  Price Index and the Livestock  Price Index  to 
the relationship  they had in 1953. This will, mean costly  fertilizers  at 
a time of reduced  prices for cattle and beef. It is a situation  where 
grassland  farmers  must critically  evaluate  their fertilizer  use and try to 
achieve  more efficiency  both with it and animal manures.

This paper deals mainly  with swards  which  are either always  cut or

FERTILIZING  GRASSLAND  FOR SILAGE
In recent  years it has been standard  practice  to fertilize  almost  all 
areas cut for silage and in 1972 the average  application  rate/acre  was 
was 84 lb N, 32 lb. P and 64 lb. K (3). More phosphorus  and potassium  
are used per acre here than in the United Kingdom  (4). Compared  
with the Netherlands,  where  phosphorus  use has remained  static  for 18 
years, the relative  position  of Ireland  has changed  from 23% to 83% of 
their rates of P application/acre  in the period 1953/73. We apply  
approximately  60% of the Netherlands  rates of K/acre  but there the use 
of potassium  has declined  (4).
SOIL FERTILITY
The increased  use of fertilizer  is reflected  in increased  soil fertility.  
In 1954 77% of soil samples  analysed  at Johnstown  Castle  were low in 
phosphorus  (below  0.5 ppm) and there were no samples  in the medium  
to high range (above  3.1 ppm) but by 1970 there were no samples  in 
the low range while 37% were in the high category  (4). The trend  for 
potassium  levels was similar. About  66% of soil samples  were very low 
in K (below  24 ppm) in 1954 but there was only 2% in this category  in 
1970 while 36% were in the high bracket  (above  100 ppm). The low 
phosphorus  soils were mainly  in the south east and the low potassium  
soils in the midlands.  There were widespread  deficiencies  of P and K 
in Ireland  during  the immediate  post war years and even until the late 
fifties. This is not so today.
SOIL  PRODUCTIVITY
In a Productivity  Experiment  conducted  for four years (1967-71)  at 
27 sites in Ireland (5) the inherent  fertility  of the soils had a marked  
influence  on the herbage  yields of the grassland  (Table 3). In the 
fourth year of the experiment,  the mean response  to phosphorus  was 
37% although  the responses  ranged  from 21 to 100%. With potassium  
there was a mean response  of 47% and a range from 18 to 161%.  
Generally  there were very poor responses  to liming  while nitrogen  in­
creased  yield by an average  of 65%.In grassland  fertilizing  there  are three  distinct  situations:

DRY  VERSUS  WET GRASSLAND
Besides  the inherent  fertility  of the soil the factor  of wetness  or dry­
ness plays a major role in the productivity  of grassland. Gleeson  (7) 
showed  that well fertilized  dry grassland  in Co. Limerick  was 26% more  
productive  than similarly  fertilized  wet grassland  while Ryan (5) report ­
ed an average  9.7% higher  yield on dry as opposed  to wet soils from his 
27 grassland  sites.
PHOSPHORUS  FERTILIZING  FOR SILAGE
Herbage  production  from two different  sites on a similar  soil type at 
Grange  demonstrates  the effect of previous  fertilizing  on phosphorus  
requirements  for silage  cutting. Site A had received  annual  dressings  of 
3-4 cwt. (8%) phosphorus  over many years while  site B received  only a 
single dressing  of 3 cwt. (8%) P/acre  in the previous  ten years. Prior to 
starting  the experiment,  site A had a soil phosphorus  reading  of 4 ppm 
and site B a value of 1-2 ppm, while both sites were grazed  swards.  
During  the experiment  the swards  were cut three times annually  for 
silage. Some results of the experiments  are given in Table 4.

34
At site A there was almost no response  to phosphorus  until the. 
fourth  year but at site B there was a response  of 11% in the first year.  
This response  increased  to 15% in the fifth year and the accumulated  
application  of half a ton of phosphorus  (8%) increased  production  by 
21% on site B. At site A, however,  in the sixth year the responses  due 
to phosphorus  were small and insignificant  although  there  was a steady 
upward  increase  in yields as the quantity  of applied  P accumulated.  
Soil phosphorus  at site A declined  to 2 ppm in the control  but it in­
creased  to 5-6 ppm with the accumulated  application  of 24 cwt (8%) 
P/acre.
It is evident  from these results that farms which have a high soil 
phosphorus  level either through  fertilizing  or natural fertility  can 
achieve  high grassland  production  when only small rates of phosphorus  
or no phosphorus  is applied  for a few years. In other words  farmers  
can cash in the legacy  of built-up  phosphorus  fertility . Naturally,  care 
must be exercised  in case deficiency  arises sooner  than expected.
PHOSPHORUS  AND SLURRY
Winter  housing  of livestock,  especially  in large numbers,  creates  a 
problem  in the collection  and storage  of animal dung and urine. A 
mature  bullock  can produce  6-7 gallons  of dung and urine per day and 
should  any dilution  occur with rain-water  the figure could rise to 8-9 
gallons/day.  Cattle dung contains  all of the phosphorus  excreted  by 
animals  while as much as 8 lb is contained  in 1,000 gallons  of cattle  
slurry. Higher  amounts  of phosphorus  do occur in slurries  collected  
from animals  fed large amounts  of meals e.g. pig slurry  contains  20-25  
lb P/1,000  gallons.
Since land spreading  of the enormous  amounts  of slurry produced  
by housed  cattle is the only practical  method  of disposal,  it is of inter ­
est to understand  the usefulness  of animal  slurries  as sources  of phos ­
phorus  for grass production  (Table  5).

The mean results over five years showed  that a response  of 17.5%  
was obtained  with 4 cwt. phosphorus  (8%)/acre/year  in the presence  of 
adequate  nitrogen  and potassium.  With the application  of slurry  there  
were little or no responses  with phosphorus.  When it is considered 
that 2,500  gallons/acre  of cattle slurry supplies  as much as 2'h cwt. of 
phosphorus  (8%) and the soil contributes  an extra 1 cwt. of P/acre,  
then it is understandable  that very poor responses  are achieved  with 
fertilizer  phosphorus.  In the case of pig slurry, excess amounts  of 
phosphorus  are supplied  even with 2,500 gallons/acre.  Farmers  who 
have both cattle and pig slurry should  alternate  the use of them on 
areas treated  with slurry. This allows  for better  use to be made  of the 
phosphorus  in the pig slurry while at the same time better  use is made  
of the potassium  in the cattle  slurry (Table  6).
POTASSIUM  AND SLURRY
The responses  achieved  with potassium  fertilizing  in the presence  of 
animal  slurries  are shown  in Table  6.

pig slurries  on grass  yields  (100 lb. D.M./acre)

There was a mean response  over five years of 19% with 4 cwt. pot­
assium/acre/year  and in the fifth year the response  was 42%. By the 
application  of cattle  slurry  there was no response  with potassium  and in 
fact with 5,000 gallons/acre  plus applied  potassium  there  was a reduct ­
ion in herbage  yields due to excess nutrient. There is little doubt  
therefore  that dressings  of 5000 gallons/acre/year  of cattle slurry can 
maintain  the potassium  demands  of intensive  silage cutting.
In the case of pig slurry however  responses  were achieved  with dress ­
ings of fertilizer  potassium.  An annual  application  of 2 cwt K/acre/  
year produced  responses  of 11.4%  with 2500 gallons/acre  of pig slurry  
and a smaller  response  of 5-8% with 5000 gallons/acre.  Pig slurry is 
generally  low in potassium,  10-12 lb K/1000  gallons  and must there ­
fore receive  some supplementation  with fertilizer  potassium.  This con­
trasts with cattle slurry which contains  40-45 lb K/1000  gallons  and
36
needs  little or no supplementation.
Nitrogen  Fertilizing  for Silage
Areas cut for silage receive  30% of all the fertilizer  nitrogen  used 
nationally  (3). This must be a sector  in which  more  efficient  usage  and 
better returns  are possible  if farmers  are to overcome  increasing  costs.  
Some details  are given in Table 7 on the herbage  production  and res­
ponses achieved  over four years with fertilizer  nitrogen  for silage.
The most salient  feature  of the results  was the response  to nitrogen  
at the first cut. In all years it was far in excess  of what was achieved  
with a mid-season  or autumn  cut. The natural  growth  of grass is al­
ways greatest  in April, May and early June and moisture  supply  is rare­
ly limiting  in this period. Consequently,  herbage  responses  to nitrogen  
are high. Growth  of grass in the June to August  period  is often re­
stricted  because  of partial drought  which can also effect  autumn  silage  
cuts. Secondly,  the daily rate of grass growth  declines  quite rapidly  
from mid July onwards.

lb O.M./acre)  and responses  (lb D.MjIb  N)

112 53.0 19.0 38.0 10.0 23.7 5.3
Our results  suggest  that a declining  rate of application  from the first 
to the third cut gives the most efficient  return per unit of N. For ex­
ample,  when 75 lb N was applied/acre/cut  the response  declined  from  
22.0 lb D.M./lb  N at the first cut to 12.2 lb D.M./lb  N at the second  
and 6.4 lb D.M./lb  N at the third cut. When the 75 lb N/acre  was in­
creased  to 112 1b N/acre  for the first cut, the response  to the extra app­
lication  was 13.3 lb D.M./lb  N. This was intermediate  to responses  
recorded  with 37 and 75 lb N/acre  in the second,  cut and far exceeded  
any of the responses  in the autumn.
Therefore  for a three cut silage system  fertilizer  nitrogen  should  be 
applied  at the following  rates; SVi cwt (26% N) for the first cut, 2'/i 
cwt for the second  and 2 cwt for the third. What is probably  more  
practical,  especially  with high cutting  charges/acre,  is to aim at maxi ­
mum yields in the first two cuts and forget  about  the autumn  silage  
cut.
37
Where  slurry is applied  to silage  areas the rates of nitrogen  can be re­
duced (Table  8). Cattle  slurry  alone increased  grass yields  by 1,150  lb 
D.M. with 2500 gals/acre  and by 1,900 lb with 5000 gals/acre,  while  
pig slurry increased  production  by 2,000  and 3,000  Ib/acre,  respective­
ly. Comparisons  of herbage  responses  with the slurries  to those  achiev­
ed with fertilizer  nitrogen  showed  that 1000 gallons  of cattle  slurry  had 
a value  equivalent  to 34 lb N while 1000  gallons  of pig slurry  was equiv ­
alent to 40 lb N. It was still beneficial  to apply some nitrogen  with 
cattle slurry  to achieve  optimum  yields.

THE GRAZED  SWARD
As the grazing  animal  returns  considerable  quantities  of dung and 
urine back onto grazed  pasture,  it is natural  to expect  that the fertiliz­
ing of those areas should  be different  to swards  cut for silage. Mature 
cattle excrete  10-12 times per day and urinate  5-6 times,  producing,  in 
the process,  an average  of 45-50  lb dung and 25-30  lb urine. In a graz­
ing season  of 200 days this amounts  to 4.5 tons of dung and 2.75 tons 
of urine or 1,600 gallons  of excreta. This excreta  contains  approxim ­
ately 80 lb N, 14 lb P and 90 lb K. Since the total area covered  by 
daily dung droppings  is only 6-8 sq. ft. and by urinations  15-18 sq. ft., 
the distribution  of the nutrients  in cattle excrements  can be very un­
even.
PHOSPHORUS  FERTILIZING  FOR GRAZING
Some five years ago we selected  two sites to investigate  the effect  
of phosphorus  fertilizing  under an all grazing system of manage­
ment. At Grange  the experimental  site was on a Brown  Earth  type soil 
of high clay content,  with an available  soil P level of 4-5 ppm and a his­
tory of annual phosphorus  fertilizing  for 20 years. At Johnstown  
Castle the soil was a Grey Brown  Podzolic,  consisting  of a loam over-  
lying a sandy clay loam,  with an available  P level of 3-4 ppm and was 
annually  fertilized  with P for 20 years  also.
Three  levels  of phosphorus;  0, 1.5 and 3.0 (8% P) cwt per acre were
38
compared  at two stocking  rates  of 3.75 and 2.5 cattle/acre.  The stock ­
ing rates were reduced  to 2.66 and 2.0 animals/acre  in July. Results  
for the fifth year of the experiment  are given in Table 9. Because  
there were no differences  between  the 1.5 and 3.0 cwt P/acre,  only the 
mean figure  for those treatments  are given.

At Grange  there was no response  to phosphorus  even though  the 
control  had received  no P for five years. The soil at this site represents  
35% of the grasslands  in the country  and making  allowance  for past 
P fertilizer  dressings,  the findings  are very significant  to many  grassland  
farmers.
At Johnstown  Castle  however  in the fifth year there was a 19% in­
crease  in liveweight/acre  with 1.5 cwt P/ecre  at the high stocking  rate. 
At the low stocking  rate the response  was 13%. This site is only re­
presentative  of sandy loams which have poor natural  reserves  of nut­
rients. The lack of responses  with more  than 1.5 cwt. (8%) P/acre on 
a phosphorus  responsive  site, such as Johnstown  Castle,  illustrates  that 
for grazing  situations  only low rates of P are required  to maintain  high 
animal  output.
POTASSIUM  FERTILIZING  FOR GRAZING
In a mixed  grazing  experiment  at Grange  over six seasons  (8) there  
was a significant  increase  in the herbage  potassium  levels  from an aver­
age of 3.0% in the first year to over 4.0% in the sixth year. There  was 
therefore  an effective  recirculation  of the herbage  potassium.  An ann­
ual maintenance  application  of 1 cwt (50%) potassium  was used, but 
this obviously  only caused  luxury  uptake  of the nutrient. In a com­
pletely grazing  situation  there is a virtually  closed potassium  cycle, so 
that the requirements  for fertilizer  potassium  are negligible.

Fertilizer  nitrogen  for spring grazing  has been investigated  and re­
commended  on the basis of cutting  experiments.  In the last two years  
the effect of a single application  of nitrogen  for spring  grass on live- 
weight  performance  of store cattle has been studied  at Grange. The 
sward was completely  grass dominant  and it was stocked  with 3.3 ani­
mals per acre. Some mean results  for 1973 are given in Table 10.
An interesting  finding  was that February  applied  nitrogen  had a re­
sidual effect until July. This is rarely found in a cutting  experiment  
with small dressings  of nitrogen  such as 2 cwt/acre.  It is suggested  that 
re-circulation  of the extra nitrogen  content  in the treated  sward  by the 
grazing  cattle contributed  somewhat  to this result. Work elsewhere  
has shown  that returns  of dung and urine are most  effective  on all grass  
swards  and can amount  to 140 lb N/acre/year  (9).
The spring nitrogen  increased  liveweight  performance  by 46% per 
animal or 65 Ib/head. This showed  a return of almost  2 cwt. live- 
weight  gain/acre  for an input of 2 cwt of (26%) nitrogen,  which  was a 
very worthwhile  expenditure  by any standards  of costing.
NITROGEN  FOR GRAZING
Usage of nitrogen  throughout  the grazing  season  is possibly  a more  
leading  question  at the moment  for dry stock farmers  than is its use in 
spring. Since 1971 three rates of nitrogen/acre  at three stocking  rates 
have been investigated  at Grange  using  a grass/clover  sward. Each seas­
on the stocking  rate was reduced  by 25% in late July or early August.  
In the first year of the experiment  the swards  had clover  contents  of 
30-35%  but last year there was only 10-11%  clover  in the low nitrogen
40
plots and 2-3% clover  in the high nitrogen  treatments,  
suits for the three  years  are given in Table 11.The mean re-
Nitrogen  at 8 cwt/acre  increased  liveweight  gain by 19% over 2 cwt 
N/acre  and the increase  was highest  at the higher  stocking  rate. The 
response  with four animals/acre  was 22.6%  versus 15% with three ani­
mals/acre. There was little or no response  with the 16 cwt (26%)  
N/acre.

Stocking  rate showed  a positive  interaction  with nitrogen.  The live- 
weight  gain with four animals/acre  was 6.5%  higher  than with three  ani­
mals/acre,  when using 2 cwt N/acre  but it was 13.6%  higher  with 8 cwt 
N/acre. This indicates  that high stocking  rates are needed  to ensure  
the greatest  return  from using nitrogen  throughout  the grazing  season.
DISCUSSION
Rising prices for livestock  products  and the relatively  cheap  supply  
of plant nutrients  in the last few years encouraged  increased  and wide ­
spread usage of fertilizers.  If similar  amounts  are used in 1974 as in 
1973 the higher  prices  will make the national  fertilizer  bill £65-70  mill­
ion annually  or a total of £500 million  in the next eight years. This is 
a very high input into agriculture  and it could  also be the watershed  in 
in future  expansion  of fertilizer  sales.
Farm livestock  retain only small quantities  of major mineral  nut­
rients - M,P,K.  - which  are present  in the food they eat. Plant  nutrients  
are brought  onto farms in fertilizers,  feeding  stuffs  and biological  nit­
rogen fixation. They are removed  in crop and livestock  products  and 
in drainage  water. In continuous  grazing  situations  the leak of nut­
rients from the system  is very small and insignificant.  We have shown  
that on grazed  swards  the responses  with P and K may be small,  or a 
number  of years in developing,  due to a build up in nutrients  and that 
fertilizer  nitrogen  may be the only nutrient  giving  worthwhile  responses  
in such cases.
In herbage  conservation  there is a large removal  of nutrients  in hay
41
and silage but if the animal  manures  are collected  properly  and are re­
turned  to the same areas there could  be an accumulation  of nutrients  in 
the soil. Feeding  stuffs bought  and fed on livestock  farms  will enrich  
the animal  slurries  with N, P and K. Where  pigs are fed on farms  the 
quantities  of fertilizers  bought  in the form of meals can be enormous  
and certainly  reduces  the dependence  on manufactured  fertilizers  for 
grassland.
We have shown that the response  to N, P and K in the presence  of 
slurries  are negligible  or reduced. With the proper  cycling  of nutrients  
there is no reason why farmers  cannot  reduce  their dependence  on 
fertilizers  for plant nutrients. The time has arrived  when nutrient  
balance  sheets must be developed  for farms in order to achieve  more  
efficient  use of nutrients. Excess  nutrients  in the form of slurry  on a 
farm should  be transported  and used elsewhere.
In the last 20 years  fertilizer  use has markedly  improved  the fertility  
of our soils. The time is now at hand when farmers  should  cash some  
of this legacy. At the same time they must be ever watchful  that 
deficiencies  do not arise. Just as in other spheres  of our economy,  
where it appears  that the 'throw  away' age is at an end, we must 
endeavour  to collect  animal manures  and wastes  more efficiently  and 
make better  use of them.

Calf Rearing Principals  and 
Practices  of Early Weaning
P.J. Caffrey,
University  College,  Dublin,  
Lyons Estate, Newcastle  P.O.,  
County Dublin.
INTRODUCTION
Any system  of calf rearing,  if it is to command  wide acceptance, 
should  satisfy  the following  criteria:
1. must ensure the survival of a high per centage  of calves;
2. must be reasonable  well defined  and simple to implement;
3. must ensure  adequate  performance  for the particular  system 
of production  envisaged;
4. must be viable  in economic  terms.
Nature's  way - single suckling  - usually  satisfies  the first three criteria  
but is not always  economically  viable. Single suckling  is, of course,  
unsuited  to raising calves from the dairy herd which are the main 
source of calves for beef production  in Ireland. Traditionally  in 
Ireland  pail feeding  of milk for a protracted  period  has been the meth ­
od most commonly  employed.  The present  paper  discusses  the early  
weaning  of calves which is essentially  concerned  with replacing  liquid  
feeding  by the feeding  of feed in a solid form at an early age. How ­
ever, before discussing  early weaning  a few comments  on the basic  
principles  of calf rearing  - which must be respected  regardless  of the 
method  of rearing  employed  - may be useful.
THE NEWBORN  CALF
The cow usually  gives birth to a healthy  calf - even if she has to do 
so at the expense  of her own tissues  - so that the survival  and perform ­
ance of the calf usually  depends  on what happens  after birth. Al­
though  the calf is usually  healthy  at birth,  it is extremely  vulnerable  to 
infection  and very limited  in the range of foods which it can digest.
Colostrum:  The  new born calf acquires  passive immunity  by the
ingestion  of colostrum,  the antibodies  of which are abosrbed  intact
45
during the first 24-36 hours of life. As the absorption  of antibodies  
declines  (some reports  indicate  that absorption  may be limited  to the 
first six hours under certain  circumstances)  it is important  that colos ­
trum be ingested  within a few hours of birth. Normally,  leaving  the 
cow and calf together  is the most satisfactory  way of ensuring  adequate  
intake  of colostrum  but the stockman  should  be on hand to ensure  that 
suckling  takes place. When calves are allowed  to suckle  their dams,  
intake of colostrum  is of the order of 114 gallons  in the first day, 
increasing  to 2'/i gallons  by the fourth day. Although  smaller  quantit ­
ies are effective  in preventing  septicaemia,  liberal quantities  may be 
required  to prevent  localised  intestinal  infections  and diseases  such as 
pneumonia.  Should  bucket  feeding  of colostrum  be practised,  it is 
important  that adequate  quantities  should be fed undiluted,  at body  
temperature  and at frequent  intervals.
In addition  to antibodies,  which are the main protection  against  in­
fection  in the newborn,  colostrum  is a better  source  of most nutrients  
than ordinary  milk and probably  contains  factors  which allow the calf 
to withstand  cold environmental  temperatures.  Colostrum  contains  
five-times  more protein,  ten-times  more Vitamin  A and considerably  
more trace elements  than ordinary  milk. In the case of vitamin  A 
(adequacy  of which is considered  by some to be important  in reducing 
the incidence  of scours  and pneumonia  ) there is little placental  transfer  
to the foetus  and colostrum  is nature's  way of ensuring  that the needs  
of the newborn  are satisfied.
Digestion: The abomasum  or true stomach  is the only functional  part 
of the ruminant  stomach  in the newborn  calf and liquids  pass directly  
into the abomasum. The calf at this stage is very limited  in his 
capacity  to digest materials,  other than the constituents  of milk. Of 
the commonly  available  materials,  eggs and glucose  are the only mater ­
ials which  the baby calf can efficiently  utilize. Materials  such as suc­
rose is an invitation  for scour if mixed with the milk for the calf.
Recently,  there has been considerable  interest  in replacing  whole  
milk by milk replacers. Milk replacers  intended  for feeding  from the 
first week onwards  should  consist  essentially  of high quality  skim milk 
powder suitably  supplemented  with homogenised  fat and vitamins.  
One of the characteristics  of 'high quality  skim milk powder'  is that the 
whey proteins  should  not be excessively  denatured  during  processing  or 
storage  (Roy, 1971; Rolls & Porter,  1973). High quality  milk replacers  
can completely  replace  whole milk and may have advantages  from the 
point of view of cost and flexibility.  Recent  developments  (e.g. soy 
flour in milk replacer  - Colvin & Ramsey,  1968) have pointed  to the 
possibility  of replacing  milk proteins  by other proteins.  Although  this 
research  field offers interesting  possibilities,  further  research  and devel­
46
opment  are required  before  these milk replctcers  can be recommended  
for feeding  from the post colostrum  period  onwards. As the calf gets 
older itsi.ability  to digest materials  other than the constituents  of milk 
increas^  end, therefore,  the specifications  for milk replacers  for older  
calves are not so strigent. While the use of 'follow-on'  milk replacers  
may have a place in systems  of rearing  such as veal production,  the use 
of a single high-quality  milk replacer  coupled  with early weaning  onto  
solid food seems  to be preferable  in most rearing  situations.  Table 1 
gives the results  of a recent  experiment  (Murphy  et al, 1970) in which  
four milk replacers,  commercially  available  on Irish market,  were com­
pared with wholemilk  (WM) in an early weaning  system  of calf rearing.

reconstituted  to contain  12.5%  dry matter  at feeding.
Under the conditions  of this study,  the milk replacers  supported  the 
same performance  as whole  milk when  fed at equal volumes.
Whereas  liquid food passes directly  into the abomasum,  solid food  
passes directly  into the rumen and rumen development  takes place  
early provided  the stimulus  of solid food is given. A four-week  old 
calf that has been accustomed  to solid food can digest  most ingredients  
as efficiently  as an adult ruminant  (Preston,  1963). However,  the 
capacity  of the rumen,  relative  to requirements,  is low at this stage and 
if maximum  performance  is to be achieved  liberal quantities  of whole  
milk must be fed. This raises the question  of 'adequate  performance  
for the particular  system of production'.  In animals  intended  for 
slaughter  as finished  beef at 15-24  months  or for first calving  at around  
2 years of age, daily liveweight  gains in the order of VA lb. over the 
first few months  should  be 'adequate':  a performance  consistent  with 
weaning  onto a solid diet at the 4-week  stage. However,  in systems  
such as veal production  where  daily gains of 2yi - 3 lb. are demanded 
of the young  calf, liberal  quantities  of milk must be fed.
47
EARLY  WEANING
Early weaning,  which in the present  context  means replacing  the 
liquid  diet by a solid diet at an early stage,  is achieved  by
(a) restricting  milk intake;
(b) providing  a suitable  concentrate  mixture;
(c) providing  adequate  roughage  either as a component  of the con­
centrate  mixture  or as long roughage;
and
(d) having  fresh water  freely  available.
Milk Restriction:  The object here is to provide  sufficient  milk (or
milk replacer)  to enable  the calf to make moderate  weight  gains with­
out completely  satisfying  its appetite  for food. In this way intake  of 
concentrates  is stimulated.  The optimum  level of milk feeding  has not 
been established  but the following  levels have proved  satisfactory  in a 
number  of investigations  and are suggested  here:
Birth Weight  of Calf (lb.)
60
80
100Whole  Milk (pints/day)
5
6 
7
Higher  levels of milk feeding  than those recommended  can be used but 
they will have the effect  of reducing  concentrate  intake  and, perhaps,  
causing  a set-back  at weaning  if weaning  takes  place  at a predetermined  
age rather than a predetermined  intake of concentrates.  Levels  sub­
stantially  lower than the ones recommended  are unlikely  to give satis­
factory  performance  (Roy etal 1958).
High quality  milk replacers  may replace  whole  milk. Opinions  differ  
as to the optimum  concentrations  at which  the milk replacer should  be 
reconstituted  but there seems to be little to be gained  from deviating  
from the concentration  of cow's milk i.e. about 12.5%  dry matter  or 
1.25 lb. of milk powder  made up to a gallon by the addition  of water.  
In once-a-day  feeding,  higher  concentrations  are sometimes  used to en­
sure that the calf consumes  all the milk offered. Whatever  concentrat ­
ion is used it is important  to ensure that the milk replacer  be 
adequately  mixed. With many milk replacers  this requires  the use of a 
mechanical  mixer and adherence  to the manufacturer ’s instructions.
The distribution  of the milk during  the milk-feeding  stage is another  
aspect  which requires  comment.  Feeding  the same daily level of milk
48
throughout  and weaning  abruptly  gives satisfactory  results and has 
much to recommend  it in the interests  of simplicity.  There  is nothing  
wrong  with gradually  weaning  the calf off milk provided  the regime  can 
be implemented.  The question  of twice-a-day  as opposed  to once-a-  
day feeding  has received  considerable  attention  over the past few years.  
In general,  once-a-day  feeding  can be safely  introduced  from about  the 
ten-day  stage onwards. The time saved as a result of once-a-day  
feeding  should  be used for inspection  of the calves,  otherwise  it may be 
desirable  to persist  with twice-a-day  feeding  which ensures  a "built-in"  
inspection  twice  a day.
Suitable  Concentrate:  The general  recommendations  for early wean­
ing concentrates  are that they should
(a) be palatable
(b) contain  16-20%  crude  protein;
(c) contain  5-10%  crude  fibre.
While these recommendations  appear  suitable  they give little informat ­
ion which  is helpful  in the actual  formulation  of rations. Traditionally,  
early weaning  mixtures  tended  to be complex  - some containing  up 
to 20 ingredients. However,  most research  reports  (e.g. Caffrey  & 
McAleese;  1964, Hardy,  1972; Milligan  & Grieve,  1970) indicate  that 
simple  mixtures  are equally  effective.  Table  2 gives the composition  of 
an early weaning  mixture  which has proved  satisfactory  over a number  
of years  at University  College,  Dublin.

Barley  in the above  mixture  can be replaced  by other  cereals  or by beet 
pulp (Connolly  et al, 1967)  and the soyabeans  can be replaced  by other  
protein sources (Hardy,  1972). There is some evidence  (Atai & 
Harshbarger,  1965) that the addition  of a sweetening  agent  such as brown  
brown sugar or molasses  may be desirable. However,  Murphy  et al., 
1970, found  no advantage  from the inclusion  of brown  sugar. What  is 
probably  more important  than a sweetening  agent is that the mixture  
should  be fed fresh daily and refusals  discarded  or fed to other cattle.  
Another  important  consideration  is the physical  form in which  the con­
centrate  is fed. In general,  coarsely  textured  mixtures  are desirable,  or
49
perhaps  essential  if long roughage  is not freely available. This usually  
means that the cereal is coarsely  ground or rolled with a moisture  
content  of about 18% in the grain. Rolling  of dry barley (less than 
14% moisture)  gives a product  of variable  texture  which  in the author's  
experience  is not desirable  in early weaning  mixtures.  Opinions  differ  
as to whether  pelleting  improves  the palatability  of the diet. The size 
and hardness  of the pellets  have probably  contributed  to variation  in 
responses  which have been reported  (Bartley,  1973). When fibre is 
limiting  in the diet, pelleting  may have the effect  of reducing  perform ­
ance (Warner  et al., 1973).
Roughage: The need for long roughage  in the diet of the early-wean ­
ed calf depends  to a large extent  on the composition  and physical  form  
of the concentrate  mixture.  While  there  are a number  of reports  where 
calves have been successfully  reared without  the provision  of long 
roughage  (e.g. Warner,  1973), the majority  of reports  indicate  long 
roughage  is desirable  from the point of view of ensuring  adequate  con­
centrate  intake  and control  of bloat and other  digestive  upsets  (Preston, 
1963; Preston,  1967; Kellaway  et al., 1973 a,b). Kellaway  et al. 
(1973a)  found that calves with access to roughage  had a growth  rate 
50% greater than a control group with no roughage  provided. It 
should  be emphasised,  however,  that roughages  are usually  provided  to 
ensure normal functioning  of the digestive  tract of the young calf 
rather than to meet nutrient  requirements.  As the calf gets older, it 
can rely to a greater  extent  on roughages  as a source  of nutrients  and 
from the 12-week  stage onwards  a daily intake  of 3 lb. of concentrates  
plus good quality  hay ad libitum  should  be capable  of ensuring  a daily  
gain of about  1.5 lb.
Hay is the roughage  of choice  for young calves but silage may be 
fed provided  the material  is fed fresh daily and free from moulds. The 
results of a trial comparing  hay and silage in an early weaning  system  
are presented  in Table  3 (Curran  et al., 1973).  The increased  performance  
ance of the silage-fed  calves  accrued  from the higher  digestibility  of the 
silage.

*** See Table  2 for composition.
On the evening  of arrival  each calf receives  3 pints of a 5% glucose  
solution  (1 oz. /pint). Milk replacer  is gradually  iritroduced  on the 
second  day and from the third day until weaning  15 oz. of milk replac ­
er reconstituted  to six pints of fluid are fed daily. Recently,  we have 
changed  to once-a-day  feeding  from the ten-day  stage without  any ill- 
effects. Weaning  takes place when a calf is consistently  eating  (i.e. for 
three consecutive  days) 500 g. of concentrate  daily. In addition  to 
the procedures  outlined  on Table 4, each calf usually  receives  on arriv ­
al a vitamin  injection  containing  250,000  i.u. Vitamin  A and 150,000  
i.u. Vitamin  D and for the first eight  days 250 mg. aureomycin  per day. 
There is no reason  to believe  that either  of these procedures  is essential  
to the successful  operation  of the rearing  system. We are currently  
investigating  the influence  of the antibiotic  feeding  on the development  
of drug resistance.
Food Intake: The fact that the calves  are penned  individually  facilit ­
ates weaning  at a pre-determined  concentrate  intake,  in this case 500 g. 
(18 oz.)/day. The total milk intake (from colostrum  stage) is about  
20 gallons  (25 lb. milk powder)  per calf and the average  age at wean­
ing is about four weeks. When calves are group-fed,  it is probably
51
desirable  to delay weaning  until the average  intake is 1V4 lb. concen ­
trates per day to ensure  that the poorer  calves  in the group  have attain ­
ed a satisfactory  level of intake. If satisfactory  intake  of concentrates  
is to be achieved  at an early age, it is essential  that the concentrates  are 
fresh at all times and that hay and clean water are freely available.
Concentrate  intake increases  rapidly  after weaning  reaching  about  
4 lb. per day at 7-8 weeks. There  may be a tendency  for the faeces  to 
become  semi-fluid  in the week immediately  after weaning  but this 
should not cause alarm as the calf usually  remains  healthy. Early  
weaned  calves may continue  to be fed concentrates  ad libitum  after  
weaning  until slaughter,  as in 'barley-beef'  production,  or more gener ­
ally restricted  to a level of 3-4 lb. per calf after the 12-week  stage with 
roughages  ad libitum.
In the case of spring born calves weaning  should  take place at least 
two weeks before  turning  out to pasture. The reason  for delaying  
turn-out  are:
(a) it enables  the stockman  to ensure  that the calves  have been satis­
factorily  weaned;
(b) it is difficult  to wean onto concentrates  when  .grass is simultane ­
ously  available  to the calf;
(c) some calves may be reluctant  to eat concentrates  at pasture  un­
less they have acquired  a taste for them prior to turn-out  and in 
general  a certain  amount  of concentrate  supplementation  at pas­
ture is necessary  until calves  are at least 12 weeks  old.
APPLICATION  OF EARLY  WEANING
Despite  the advantages  of early weaning  with respect  to reduced 
scouring  and reduced  feed costs, there is often a reluctance  on the part 
of producers  to adopt  this system  of rearing. Numerous  reports  (e.g. 
Harte & Curran,  1964) have, however,  shown  that early weaning  com­
pares favourably  with the more traditional  methods  of rearing. A 
recent experiment  at Lyons (Brophy  & Caffrey,  1973) has confirmed  
that the early weaned  calf is at no permanent  disadvantage  provided  the 
deficit in milk intake is made good by an equivalent  amount  of con­
centrates.  Three groups of calves were involved  in the study:
(i) Control  - early weaned  as outlined  in Table 4 and fed concen ­
trates  to a maximum  of 4.4 lb. (2 Kg) per day;
(ii) High  concentrates  - as 'control'  but with maximum  concentrate  
intake  at 5.5 lb. (2.5 Kg) per day;
52
(iii) High milk - milk feeding  prolonged  for 4 weeks beyond  the 
'control'  weaning  stage and maximum  concentrate  intake  main ­
tained at 4.4 lb per day. Hay was available  ad libitum  to all 
groups.
Intake  and performance  data are presented  in Table  5.

Hay intake  was low (about  % cwt. per calf) and not greatly  influenc ­
ed by treatment  and is, therefore,  ignored  in the present  discussion. 
As expected,  calves on the 'High Milk' treatment  were heavier  at 7- 
week stage than the other calves. However,  the 'High Concentrate'  
group  had made up the deficit  by the 12-week  stage. When we com­
pare the relative  intakes  on the 'High Concentrate'  and the 'High Milk'  
treatments,  it appears  that 20 gallons  of milk replacer  (25 lb. milk 
Fxjwder)  is equivalent  to 52 lb. of concentrate.  From an economic  
viewpoint  it appears  that early weaning  is justified  unless  the cost (on 
a unit weight  basis) of milk powder  is less than twice the cost of con­
centrates  - a situation  which  rarely if ever obtains.
It is also clear from Table 5 that when calves are early weaned  
concentrates  must be fed to make up the milk deficit. For example, 
it would  take 5 lb. of concentrates  to replace  2 gal. of milk in the diet 
of a 12-week  old calf. Failure  to recognise  this will obviously  give 
disappointing  results  if early weaning  is adopted.
As mentioned  in the introduction,  the system  of calf rearing  adopt ­
ed must be suited to the system  of production  envisaged.  Over the 
past few years we have been using  early weaning  in two systems  of beef 
production  at Lyons:
(1) September-born  calves intended  for slaughter  at 18 months.
53
weighing  972 cwt.:
(2) March-born  calves intended  for slaughter  at 2 years, weighing  
1072 cwt.
In the case of the September-born  calves,  it is important  that the calf 
should be at least 400 lb. by time of turn-out  to grass in April while  
the March calf should reach 400 lb. by mid-October.  To achieve  
these targets  the September  calves  are early weaned  and subsequently  
fed concentrates  to maximum  of 2 kg and hay ad lib. up to turn-out  in 
early April. The March calves  are bought  in early March,  weaned  by 
the end of March and fed concentrates  and hay ad lib. until turn-out  to 
pasture  in mid-April. At pasture  the March calves are fed concen ­
trates at rate of 1 kg per head daily until mid-June  when they are 
changed  onto aftergrass. From mid-June  onwards  no concentrates  
are fed. Table 6 gives the feed requirements  for the September  - and 
March-born  calves up to the 400 lb. stage, when the calves are 
approximately  7 months old.

Concentrates 2 cwt. 7 cwt.
Hay % cwt. 5 - 6 cwt.
Grass Apr - Oct None
Since grass grazed in situ is the cheapest  feed available  to the Irish 
producer,  it is obvious  from Table 6 that efficient  use of grass greatly  
reduces  the cost of rearing  spring  calves. Grazing  management  is de­
scribed  elsewhere  in this Journal.  It is sufficient  to say here that early-  
weaning  can be incorporated  into a system  of production  which  makes  
efficient  utilization  of grassland.
CONCLUSIONS
As with all systems  of production,  attention  to detail is the key to 
successful  calf rearing. In the present  paper  some of the more import ­
ant principles  and practices  in the successful  execution  of early wean­
ing have been emphasised.
The particular  rearing  system  adopted  by the individual  producer  
will depend  on the alternatives  available  as well as the expertise  and
54
likes and dislikes  of the feeder. With increasing  intensification,  ease of 
operation  and economics  are likely to be major considerations  in the 
selection  of a rearing  system. In the author's  view,  early weaning  is an 
economic  and relatively  simple system to operate  which should be 
adaptable  to most situations.  It should  give adequate  performance  for 
most situations  and the specialised  calf-rearer  should  be able to keep  
mortality  to less than 2%.

Major Progress  towards  Oestrus  
Synchronisation  in Cattle
Dr. J. Sreenan
Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
INTRODUCTION
Methods  of oestrus induction  and synchronisation  in sheep have 
been practised  on Irish farms  for a number  of years. Successful  oestrus 
control in the sheep by intravaginal  application  of progestagens  was 
first reported  ten years ago. (Robinson,  1964). Subsequently,  many  
studies  have been carried  out on various  aspects  of reproduction  in the 
ewe both within the breeding  season and in the anoestrus  or out-of-  
season  period. Because  of the greater  facilities  required  and the greater 
costs involved  methods  ofoestrouscycle  control  in cattle  have not been  
as intensively  studied.
For the calf producer,  however,  successful  methods  of oestrous  cycle 
control  would have many advantages  both in economic  return and 
efficient  management.  Firstly,  controlled  breeding  techniques  in cattle  
would  facilitate  the introduction  of genetically  superior  bulls from the 
artificial  insemination  service into the suckler  herd. At present  be­
cause of the problems  of oestrus  detection  in the suckler  cow and also 
because  of the high labour  costs that would be involved  in detecting  
oestrus  in individual  animals  under natural  conditions,  artificial  insem ­
ination  is not normally  practised  in suckler  herds. The advantage  of 
breeding  from some of the high performance  A.I. bulls  would  of course  
take the form of increased  weight  gain in the calf. Secondly,  controll ­
ed breeding  methods  would  lead to a shorter  calving  season  and batch  
calving,  thus allowing  proper  planning  of feed and labour  requirements  
during  the various  phases  of the operation.  Further  efficiency  would  
be gained  by using a successful  technique  for synchronising  ovulation  as 
well as oestrus  thus eliminating  the need for oestrus  detection  and 
allowing  insemination  to be carried  out on groups  of treated  animals  at 
a predetermined  time. This would  mean a single  visit from the insem-  
inator  to cover 20-30  animals  and would  be of benefit  to both the farm  
and A.I. manager  alike.
The aim of the present  studies  being carried  out at the Agricultural  
Institute  on oestrus  and ovulation  control  in cattle is to develop  meth ­
ods that would  be practical  under  Irish farming  conditions.  Elsewhere
57
in this Journal  Dr. J. Roche  has referred  to the Agricultural  Institute ’s 
oestrus  synchronisation  work being carried  out at Grange. This paper  
describes  the research  work undertaken  at the Institute's  Western  Re­
search Centre  at Belclare. These studies  include  research  on various 
methods  of induction  and synchronisation  of oestrus  and ovulation  in 
heifers  and cows, both cyclic and inactive,  and take account  of both 
the beef and dairy situations.
OESTRC  JS CYCLE  CONTROL
The normal  cyclic  activity  in the cow or heifer  is based  on the prod ­
uction  and interaction  of a complicated  series of endocrine  hormones. 
In recent  years much research  has been devoted  to the identification  
and measurement  of many of these compounds  which are involved  in 
the normal  ovarian  cycle. In Fig. 1 three of the most important  of 
these hormones  are shown  during  the normal  cvcie.
Fig. 1
HANSEL  & ECHTERNKAMP  {\972)
In order to control  oestrus  or ovulation  it is necessary  to tempor ­
arily alter the levels and timing  of production  of some of these hor­
mones. In so far as gaining  control  over the ovarian  cycle is concerned  
probably  the most useful indicator  of events is the level of pro­
gesterone. Following  oestrus  and ovulation  a corpus  luteum  is formed
58
which produces  progesterone  at an increasing  rate until midcycle;  the 
level then remains  fairly constant  until regression  of the corpus  luteum  
which occurs  fairly rapidly  around  day 17-18  of the cycle. Regression  
of the corpus  luteum  means  a sharp  decline  in the level of progesterone  
and this, associated  with other events,  means  the occurrence  of oestrus 
within about three days. Essentially  there are two main methods  of 
synchronising  oestrus  in cyclic  animals.
1 The first method  depends  on simulating  the action  of the cyclic  
corpus luteum. This is achieved  by introducing  a progestagen  
hormone  which acts like a corpus  luteum  and prolongs  the luteal  
phase of the cycle until the corpora  lutea of all animals  have 
regressed;  following  withdrawal  of the progestagen  a similar  ser­
ies of events  takes place as in the normal  cycle. In other  words  
following  the decline  of progesterone  level a high proportion  of 
animals will be in oestrus within 2-4 days (Hansel, 1961;  
Lamond,  1964; Jochle,  1972). This manipulation  of the pro­
gesterone  level is shown  diagrammatically  in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2
Progestagen
The second method  of synchronising  oestrus  in cyclic  animals 
is by administration  of compounds  which will themselves  cause  
premature  regression  of the corpus  luteum  with the consequent  
decline  in progesterone  level. Some of the compounds  used in 
early studies  such as oxytocin  (Armstrong  & Hansel,  1969) and 
oestradiol  (Wiltbank,  1966) were effective  in causing  corpus  lut­
eum regression  but were not satisfactory  as regards  fertility.  
More recently  however  a new series of compounds  have been ex­
amined. These are termed  prostaglandins  and have shown  some  
promise  both in synchronisation  of oestrus  and in subsequent 
fertility  levels. The prostaglandins  are naturally  occurring  in the 
tissues and are already involved  in normal cycle regulation.  
They can now be synthetically  produced  on a large scale. The
59
action of the prostaglandins  in causing  corpus  luteum  regression  
is shown  diagrammatically  in Fig. 3.

Prostaglandin
treatment
Days of oestrus cycle
The sharp decline  in progesterone  level following  their administrat ­
ion is similar  to that following  normal  regression  at day 17-18  of the 
cycle. From much of the work carried  out so far with prostaglandins  
it would seem that they have one limitation,  namely,  they are only 
effective  on corpora  lutea during  the phase  of high progesterone  output  
i.e. approximately  between  days 5 and 16 of the cycle. This also 
means that animals  must be cyclic before any prostaglandin  routine  
would  be successful.
The post-partum  suckler  cow is one category  of animal  which  pres­
ents a relatively  greater  problem  in cycle control  studies  because  of a 
period  of anoestrus. Following  calving,  a period  of lactation  anoest-  
trus occurs  and is confounded  with nutrition  effects  at this time. There ­
fore control  of the cycle in this group  really means  both induction  and 
synchronisation  of oestrus.
A series  of studies  involving  mainly  progestagen  treatments  administ ­
ered in different  ways and prostaglandin  analogues  administered  intra ­
muscularly  were carried  out on cyclic  heifers  at the Agricultural  Insti­
tute, Belclare,  and on heifers  and suckler  cows on farms  in co-operation  
with farmers,  the advisory  service  and artificial  insemination  station  
managers.

METHODS  OF TREATMENT  USED
In attempting  to control  the bovine  cycle by administration  of pro­
gestagens,  one problem  which has been encountered  by many  workers  
is a method  of hormone  administration  that will release the right  
amount  at the right rate. Many reports  have dealt with daily intra ­
muscular  injections  (Trimberger  & Hansel,  1955; Ulberg & Lindley,  
1960) or incorporation  in the feed (Zimbelman,  1963). Neither  of 
these methods  would be practical  under Irish farming  conditions.  A 
few authors  have examined  the use of intravaginal  sponge  pessaries.  
However  all report  high sponge  losses and therefore  reduced  treatment  
responses  in cattle (Wishart  & Hoskins,  1968; Hale & Symington,  1969;  
Hignett  et al. 1970). But because  the intravaginal  sponge  technique  
has been widely  adopted  for use in sheep,  it was decided  to examine  its 
possible  use in cattle and a number  of factors  affecting  sponge  retent ­
ion in heifers  and cows were studied  (Sreenan,  1970). Data on the 
effect of hormone  compound  on retention  are shown in Table 1.

Total 192 90.4 234 65.6
Sponges  containing  progesterone  were lost more often than those  with 
cronolone. However  it seems  more probable  that the effect  was one 
of density  rather  than hormone  compound  per se. However  hormone  
compound  may for other reasons  have an effect  on retention  and Aus­
tralian  workers  (Moore  & Robinson  1967) have reported  a high sponge  
loss when they used progesterone.  Having  selected  one polyurethane  
sponge  type, it was then included  in a study of a number  of possible 
methods  of progestagen  administration  and these are outlined  in Table  
2.

Progesterone  was administered  either by intravaginal  polyurethane  
sponge  or subcutaneous  silastic  rubber  implants. Cronolone  was ad­
ministered  in a similar manner  and also by daily intramuscular  (i/m)  
injections.  The progestagen  SC-21009  was administered  by very small  
hydron  implants  inserted  into the animals  ear, combined  with oestrad ­
iol valerate  and SC-21009  i/m at the same time.
OESTRUS  RESPONSE  FOLLOWING  ALL TREATMENTS
The relative  merits  of all treatments  in inducing  oestrus  in this trial 
are shown in Table 3. All animals  used were cyclic Hereford  cross

Progesterone  sponges  inserted  for 17-20  days (A) effected  a very high 
oestrus  response. Of 46 animals  ten lost sponges  towards  the end of 
the treatment  period  but seven of these  ten showed  oestrus. It may be 
that they lost sponges  because  they came into oestrus  and not that they 
showed  oestrus  as a result of sponge  loss. However  the oestrus  re­
sponse  of all animals  of this group  retaining  their treatments  was 35/36  
or 97.2%. Progesterone  implants  and cronolone  sponges  had much 
poorer  oestrus  response,  mainly  because  many of the heifers  had shown 
oestrus  at their normal time with the treatments  still in place. The 
other progestagens  (SC-21009  hydron implants)  were similar to the 
progesterone  sponges  in effecting  a high oestrus  response  following  
withdrawal  as was cronolone  i/m. The other type of treatment,  the 
prostaglandin  analogue,  was very effective  in inducing  oestrus  by caus­
ing rapid regression  of the corpus  luteum  but all of the animals  in this 
group  were selected  between  day 6 and 16 of the cycle.
Thus it is possible  to achieve  high heat responses  and many other  
authors  report similar  data (Review,  Hansel,  1972 and Jochle,  1972).  
However  unless  the heat response  is over a reasonably  confined  period  
of time it is of little value.

The degree of synchronisation  of oestrus  for the best of the treat ­
ments  is shown  in Table  4.

Little or no oestrous  response  occurred  within  the 24 hours  after treat ­
ment removal. The heat spread  periods  in Table  4 start 24 hours  after  
treatment  removal. The progesterone  sponge  (A) had a fairly high de­
gree of synchronisation  with over 80 per cent of heats  occurring  over a 
48 hour period. Cronolone  i/m had an equally  high degree  of syn­
chronisation  but obviously  this is not a practical  treatment  as animals 
have to be treated  daily over a full cycle. The SC-21009  implants  had 
the highest  degree of synchronisation  with 93.8 per cent of heats oc­
curring  over a 48 hour period. The prostaglandin  treatment  had the 
greatest  spread with only about 50 per cent of heats occurring  over a 
2-day period.
It is clear therefore  that treatments  are available  which  can effect  a 
high oestrous  response  with high degree  of synchronisation.  It was neces ­
sary then to determine  the fertility  of animals  at this induced  heat 
after treatment.  This was carried out by breeding  animals  either to 
bulls or A.I. and slaughtering  them between  50-60 days from breeding 
or else allowing  them to calve down  on the farm.

Progesterone  (A) sponges  have a pregnancy  rate of 52.5 pier cent which  
is approx.  10-15 per cent below normal  first service  conception  for 
heifers (Laing, 1970; Boyd & Reed, 1971). Similarly  cronolone  
sponges  showed  a reduced  level of fertility  and this figure of 44 per 
cent would  be in agreement  with the data of Wishart  & Hoskins  (1968).  
Cronolone  i/m has a normal  fertility  level and similar  to that achieved  
by Wishart  (1973)  in Friesian  heifers. SC-21009  implant while  having 
the highest  degree  of synchronisation  had a reduced  level of fertility  at 
the controlled  heat. However  subsequent  work here and data from  
other authors  shows that this level is probably  below normal  exper ­
ience. The French  worker  Mauleon  (1974)  has produced  data show ­
ing that the fertility  data for SC-21009  varies  between  cows and heifers  
and also between  particular  breeds  of heifers.
Lastly fertility  following  the prostaglandin  analogue  would  seem to 
be about normal. There are only ten animals  involved  here but the 
indications  are good and are in agreement  with similar  work  elsewhere.  
The second  service  conception  rates of all groups  do not differ from  
each other or from control  or normal  conception  rate and indeed  the 
combined  first and second  conception  rates are all eighty per cent or 
over.
Because  in the earlier studies  some of the treatment  groups  were  
bred to bulls it was then necessary  to determine  whether  in fact these  
fertility  levels would still hold following  artificial  insemination.  One 
treatment  was selected  [progesterone  over 20 days (A)land  at the in­
duced  oestrus  heifers  were bred either to the bull or A.I. The results 
are shown  in Table  6.

Again there were sponge losses but at a similar level (10%) in each 
group. All animals  were bred as they came in oestrus  and pregnancy  
rates are shown to be almost  equal, and differ little from that in the 
earlier trial. Following  both first and second  service  combined,  87.5 
per cent of all treated  animals  had conceived. It would seem that,  
provided  animals  are inseminated  at about mid-heat  or 6 hours from  
the start, there is no difference  between  natural  mating  or artificial  
insemination  in terms of pregnancy  rate following  this treatment.
It has been mentioned  earlier that there are two main methods  of 
synchronisation,  based on either  simulation  or regression  of the corpus  
luteum. More recently,  however,  some reports  have appeared  com­
bining these two methods  and as a result shortening  the treatment  
period  by half. This means  injection  of a compound  capable  of caus­
ing corpus  luteum  regression  and at the same time administration  of a 
progestagen  for a short period  (9-10 days). This combination  would  
have advantages  for the sponge  as little loss should  occur before  9-10 
days. The effect of shortening  the treatment  and adding  in both 
oestradiol  and progesterone  intramuscularly  was compared  with the 
standard  progesterone  (A) 20 day sponge. The pregnancy  rates follow ­
ing breeding  by either A.I. or natural mating are given in Table 7.

Again,  fertility  levels following  the long term progesterone  sponge  are 
about 50 per cent while pregnancy  rates following  the shortened  (10 
day) treatment  are approximately  10 per cent higher  for each group.  
While numbers  involved  here are small,  present  work indicates  that it is 
possible  to achieve  approximately  60 per cent pregnancy  rate following  
the short term treatment.  Another  advantage  with the sponge  would  
be the high retention  rate over a 9-10 day period. In this trial retent ­
ion rate over a 10 day period  was 96 per cent in heifers.
All of this work was carried  out on cyclic  heifers  at Belclare  and is a 
different situation  to that found  at farm level.

FARM  TRIAL  SERIES
In treating  animals  at farm level information  such as cyclic  activity,  
stage of cycle, etc. will not be available. However  unless  treatments  
are successful  at farm level they are of little value. In order to test 
some of the best treatments  a series of farm trials were arranged  with 
co-operation  from the Advisory  Service. Breeding  in most cases was 
by A.I. through  the A.I. Station  Managers.
Preliminary  results  are given in Table  8.

The trials involved  a total of 437 animals  and heat responses  and 
non-return  rates are given separately  for heifers  and cows. The cows  
were all beef suckler  cows with calves at foot. While  non-return  rates 
are not a good indicator  of pregnancy,  especially  in the suckler  cow, 
pregnancy  diagnoisis  by palpitation  in a number  of these farms  would  
indicate  a pregnancy  rate to the induced  heat of approximately  45-55  
per cent. Overt  heat response  was lower  than that recorded  at Belclare  
but all animals  were covered  by A.I. on fixed days following  treatment  
removal.
A further  series  of trials were conducted  during  the autumn  in which  
the short duration  treatments  only were applied  (Table  9). Heat re­
sponse  was much higher  than previously,  with over 80 per cent of ani­
mals showing  oestrus  following  treatment.  Only non-return  (60 day) 
rate is as yet available for these animals but indications  are 
that it is somewhat  better than the early long term treatment.  One 
factor  that would  seem to have a large effect  on treatment  outcome  is 
the nutritional  status  of the animals  at treatment.

SUMMARY
From these studies  on induction  and synchronisation  of oestrus  in 
beef heifers  and suckler  cows encouraging  results  have been obtained  
following  the administration  of some of the treatments.  The short ­
term progestagen  treatments  have shown pregnancy  rates to the syn­
chronised  oestrus in the region of 60 per cent. The simple intra ­
muscular  prostaglandin  treatment  has resulted  in a pregnancy  rate of 
70 per cent. Initial farm trials have shown that pregnancy  rates of 
approximately  45-55 per cent are possible  and later trials indicate  that 
this may be in the region  of 55-60 per cent following  modification  of 
some  of the treatments.
While  this is only the beginning  of a large area of work  it now seems  
possible  that in the near future  practical  treatments  for the induction  
and synchronisation  of oestrus  will be available  to farmers. Before  this 
is achieved,  full scale field testing  will be required  and this will have to 
be organised  in co-operation  with the artificial  insemination  service  
because  the greatest  advantage  would  be the introduction  of A.I. into 
the beef herds.

Grazing Management  for 
Dairy Calves and Heifers

Shinfield,  Reading.
INTRODUCTION
As herds increase  in size the number  of young  stock reared  as re­
placements  increases  and it becomes  more important to develop  special­
ised systems  of rearing  which are simple and economic.  The young  
stock enterprise  on the dairy farm usually  suffers  from a lack of impos ­
ed management  and as a result  of poor growth  rates heifers  often calve  
for the first time at a late age and in the process  require  a large agreage  
of land for feeding  purposes. It is therefore  advisable  to organise  rear­
ing so that heifers  are calved  at about  two years  of age because  this has 
the additional  advantage  of fitting  in with the one season  calving  patt­
ern practised  on many farms. Also,  stocking  rates should  be increased  
to comparable  levels  in the dairy herd.
It is important  that the heifers  are large enough  at first calving  in 
order to minimise  management  problems  and the aim should  be to 
achieve  a pre-calving  liveweight  of 1100 lb. This represents  an average  
liveweight  gain of about 1.5 Ib/day during  the rearing  period and as 
grass is by far the cheapest  food available,  growth  during  the grazing 
season  should  be optimised.
The objectives  in grazing  management  are to achieve  high liveweight  
gains per animal but at the same time to efficiently  utilise the grass  
available. Such an achievement  is somewhat  difficult at high stocking  
rates due to problems  with young  calves. Firstly,  they graze  for fewer  
hours per day and also graze more selectively  than older cattle,  and 
consequently  if they are forced  to utilise  most  of the grass in a paddock  
before being moved  to a new paddock,  resulting  liveweight  gains are 
poor. Secondly,  if the same area of land is used for a number  of years  
to intensively  graze young calves, stomach  worms become  a major  
problem.  These  normally  occur  from July onwards.
Experiments  at NIRD  have aimed  at overcoming  these two problems  
by grazing  management.
71
A LEADER-FOLLOWER  SYSTEM  OF GRAZING
In 1968/9  a comparison  was made using 184 mainly  autumn-born  
young stock between  a conventional  system  in which calves  and older  
heifers  rotationally  grazed  in completely  separate  paddock  systems,  and 
an experimental  system  in which  calves  rotationally  grazed  immediately  
in front of older  heifers
Half of the calves on each system  were regularly  drenched  with an 
anthelmintic  from July onwards. All calves  were given an oral vaccine  
against  husk. The results  of this comparison  given in Table 1 show 
that the liveweight  gain of calves  on the conventional  system  responded 
to drenching.  Thus a substantial  worm  burden  was present,  but on the 
leader-follower  system  there was no response  signifying  the absence  of 
a large worm  burden. A comparison  of the drenched  calves  on the two 
systems  also shows  an advantage  for the leader-follower  system  due to 
the calves being allowed  to graze selectively. The liveweight  gains of 
the heifers,  although  slightly  lower on the leader-follower  system,  were  
adequate  on both systems.

The results from the leader-follower  system  were very encouraging  
and this was then adopted  at NIRD as the standard  grazing  system. A 
study was then made of the effect of stocking  rate. An increase  in 
stocking  rate was shown  to depress  the liveweight  gain of the calves  as 
well as the heifers,  as indicated  in Table  2, and this again illustrates  the 
sensitivity  of calves to changes  in grass supply. Stocking  rate also 
affected  the production  and utilisation  of grass dry matter. A decrease  
in acreage  from 0.8 to 0.6 acres per replacement  unit (a replacement  
unit = 1 calf + 1 heifer)  reduced  total grass dry matter  production  by 
7% and increased  total utilisation  by 9%. The high levels  of utilisation  
emphasise  the high efficiency  of grazing  cattle  in harvesting  grass. The 
levels of grass production  were generally  low due to low rainfall  on the 
valley  gravel  type of soil. '

The length of the grazing rotation does not appear  to be an im-
portant  factor affecting  liveweight  gains. Recent  experiments  at Nl RD 
have shown only small differences  between  21 and 35 day rotations.
The size of animal at turnout  is an important  factor  affecting  live- 
weight  gains, as shown  in Table 3. Older and larger  calves  and heifers  
grow faster than younger,  smaller  cattle. Spring  born animals  will 
therefore  always  have lower  growth  rates than autumn  born.

ORGANISATION  OF A LEADER-FOLLOWER  GRAZING  SYSTEM
The first decision  must be to optimise  the production  of grass. Al­
though critical comparisons  have not been carried out, this grazing 
system  has been successfully  tested on both permanent  and temporary  
grass, and despite  the rise in fertilizer  costs,  economic  responses  in grass  
dry matter production  up to 200 units/acre  of nitrogen  are likely to 
occur  under  most conditions.
The most difficult  decision  concerns  the choice of the optimum  
stocking  rate which  will depend  on (a) the level of grass production,  (b) 
how much silage or hay is to be taken  from the area, and (c) the size of 
the animals  (spring  or autumn  born). A guide to this choice  taking  
into account  these factors  is given in Table  4.

placements

12,000 0.5 0.3 0.8 0.4 0.3 0.7
The area for grazing  must then be subdivided  into paddocks,  the num­
ber depending  on the amount  of silage or hay to be removed. In a 
totally integrated  system  where  all the conservation  is taken from the 
paddock  area, 10-12  will be necessary  in order  to give flexibility  during  
cutting. The required  quantity  of conservation  can be attained  by 
cutting  each paddock  once e.g. in a 10 paddock  system,  6 paddocks  for 
the first and 4 for the second  cut.
In a two sward system where no conservation  is taken from the 
paddocks,  6-8 paddocks  are adequate  and management  can be simpli ­
fied by having  a fixed grazing  cycle with a rigid twice weekly  move ­
ment of animals.
Supplementary  feeding  of concentrates  at grass for most of the seas­
on is unnecessary.  At turnout  concentrate  feeding  need only be con­
tinued for the first week except  for spring born calves,  which must 
continue  on concentrates  up to 3 months  of age. At the end of the 
season it is often beneficial  to feed 3-4 Ib/day of barley for the last 
6 weeks  at grass.
CONCLUSIONS
Most of the progress  to be made in the dairy replacement  enterprise  
is during  the grazing  season. Stocking  rates will have to be increased  
if similar  levels of grazing  efficiency  to the dairy herd are to be achiev­
ed. This will involve  the imposition  of specialised  grazing  manage ­
ment.
Many of the problems  associated  with intensive  grazing  with young  
cattle appear  to be overcome  by the use of a leader-follower  grazing  
system. This enables  the calves  to graze selectively  giving  high growth  
rates, controls  the build-up  of stomach  worms  in calves,  gives adequate 
growth  rates in the following  heifers  and high levels  of grass utilisation.  
The objectives  of high liveweight  gains in cattle maintained  at high 
stocking  rates therefore  can be achieved. The system  is now being  
used successfully  on many commercial  farms.

Reproduction  in Spring  
Calving Dairy Cows
K. O'Farrell,  Agricultural  Institute,
Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
INTRODUCTION
A concentrated  calving  pattern  within six weeks  prior to the cows  
going out to grass has a major  influence  on efficient  herd management. 
The aim should be to calve 90% of the herd within an eight week 
period.
Although  a concentrated  calving  pattern  may not be immediately  
attainable  particularly  in herds which presently  have a very prolonged  
calving pattern,  the calving  season can be shortened  considerably  by 
shortening  the breeding  period  and by culling  or carrying  over the barr­
en cows.
The more important  factors  affecting  compact  calving  and repro ­
ductive performance  which have been examined  at Moorepark  are:
1. Heat Detection
2. Conception  Rate and Submission  Rate
3. Time of Insemination
4. Nutrition
5. Artificial  Insemination  and Natural  Service
1. HEAT DETECTION
This is perhaps  the single most important  factor. There  are three  
methods  of heat detection:
(a) Observation
(b) Observation  with Heat Mount  Detectors  (Kamar)
(c) Vasectomised  or Teaser  Bulls fitted  with a chin ball mating  device.
OBSERVATION
This is the most common  method  of heat detection.  But it can be 
unreliable.  Research  (1) shows  that where  heat detection  is carried  out 
by the milker in addition  to his other chores up to 12% of animals
77
presented  for insemination  are not in heat. This error is increased  to 
36% when heat checks  are made as the animals  are driven  to and from  
the milking  shed. Table 1 shows  the times  of onset  of heat in a spring  
calving  herd.

By 10 am up to 50% of heats which are to occur  on the particular  day 
are recorded.  Two further  checks,  one at 2 pm and another  after even­
ing milking  should  result in over 80% of heats being detected. It is 
important  to remember  that while the average  length of heat is 17 
hours some may be as short  as four hours. Thus the more  frequent  the 
observations  the more  heats  will be detached.
OBSERVATION  ^LUS HEAT  MOUNT  DETECTORS  (KAMARS)
These  detectors  are glued to the back of the cow or heifer  between 
the hip bones. Pressure  from the brisket  of the mounting  animal 
triggers  the detector  which then changes  colour  to red. Over 90% 
efficiency  has been claimed  for these detectors  as a means of heat 
detection. Results  from trials at Moorepark  show that they are far 
from satisfactory.  Table 2 shows  that only 47% were retained  before  
or at heat. The low retention  rate is due to the fact that spring  calving  
cows "mount"  and lose their hair at breeding  time. Costing  30p each 
they are a poor investment.

VASECTOMISED  OR TEASER  BULLS
These bulls are fitted with a chin ball mating  device. This method  
has been shown to be 90% efficient  in heat detection.  Research  (2) 
indicates  that they reduce  the incidence  of "silent"  heats by one third.  
They also reduce  the labour  and time involved  in heat detection.  How ­
ever teaser bulls are expensive  to maintain.  They also pose managerial  
problems  particularly  around  the dairy or parlour. False mountings
78
may occur and the bull may disrupt  milking  routine. It is advisable  
therefore  that the bull be removed  from the herd before milking.
If a^teaser  bull is run with more than 40 animals  a significant  num­
ber of heats may be missed  as "harem"  formation  tends to occur. In 
such circumstances  it is advisable  to use a second teaser bull.
The best system  for dairy herds in my opinion  is frequent  and time ­
ly observations  during  the day. Results  are as good as any of the other  
methods. However  teaser bulls have a definite  place particularly  with 
replacement  heifers  which  are to be artificially  bred.
Whatever  form of heat detection  is used proper  animal  identification  
is essential. At Moorepark  neck bands,  medallions,  freeze  brands  and/ 
or plastic  ear tags are used. One of these alternatives  is recommended.
The ultimate  answer  to heat detection  is synchronisation  and insem ­
ination  without  reference  to heat. This development  will emerge  in 
the near future.
2. CONCEPTION  RATE
The interval  from calving  to service  has a direct  effect  on conception  
rate. Table 3 shows  this effect.
Table  3 Effect  of service  Interval  on Conception  Rate

Service  Interval11-31  32-52 53-73 74-94
(days)
1st Service  C.R.% 35 54 60 68
The longer  the calving  service  interval  the higher  the conception  rate. 
However,  if one is to achieve  some form of compact  calving  some  
animals  will have to be served before the recommended  50-60 day 
calving to service interval. Submission  rate, a relatively  new term,  
plays an important  role in compact  calving. It is defined  as the per­
centage  of cows correctly  detected  in heat and inseminated  during  the 
first four weeks  of mating. Table 4 shows  the interaction  of concept ­
ion rate and submission  rate on the percentage  of animals  calving  in a 
four week period.

3 68 85 55

In this situation  a farmer  decides  for example  that from mid-April  all 
animals  that come on heat will be served. Case 1 shows  that the ad­
vantages  of a high conception  rate are offset  by a low submission  rate 
e.g. the farmer allows all animals  irrespective  of calving  date 60-70  
days from calving  to service. Case 2 shows  that although  the concept ­
ion rate is low the overall  percentage  calving  in four weeks  is higher  due 
to a high submission  rate. This is achieved  by inseminating  all animals 
that come on heat irrespective  of calving  service  interval  after the be­
ginning  of the breeding  season. Case 3 is the ideal situation  and in 
New Zealand  some farhners  have reached  a level of 72% of their herd 
calving  in four weeks. If heifer  matings  are added  to Case 2 there is no 
reason  why 90% should  not be in calf within  8 weeks  of the beginning  
of mating.
3. TIME  OF INSEMINATION
One of the factors  affecting  conception  rate is time of insemination.  
For optimum  fertility  the time relationship  between  oestrus/ovulation  
and insemination  is important. The ova survive  for about  six hours 
and the sperm  for about 36 hours. Information  on the optimum  time 
for insemination  varies greatly  (3,4,5). The range varies  from three to 
25 hours after heat onset. In 1971 a trial was carried  out at Moore ­
park to determine  the optimum  time insemination.  The results  
(Table 5) show that the conception  rates achieved  during  the first 12 
hours of the heat period  are significantly  (P> 0.05) lower than for the 
12 to 24 hour period.

Time (hrs)  
C.R.%0-6
486-12
4012-18
5918-24
65
However  recent  evidence  (6) from New Zealand  indicates  that time 
of insemination  is not as important  for bulls which  have above  average  
fertility  as for those with average  or below  average. Sperm  from the 
latter have a shorter  "in vivo" life span and die before ovulation.  
Hence  the lower conception  rates. MacMillan  concludes  that "in vivo"  
sperm liability  is therefore  a major factor  influencing  a sire's fertility,  
as suggested  by the large differences  in conception  rate due to the 
effect  of time of insemination.
Additives  to semen diluents  such as amylase  and B glucuronidase  
tend to accellerate  sperm  capacitation  time. From  the above  evidence  
it would appear  that a strong case can be made for the development  
and addition  of certain  diluents  which would  reduce  capacitation  time 
and thereby  increase  fertility.
80
4. NUTRITION
The existence  of a positive  relationship  between  plane of nutrition  
and/or  liveweight  change  and fertility  in the cow has been widely  ac­
cepted. Whilst  some good evidence  exists  to support  the case there is 
equally  some evidence  which does not do so (7,8,9,10).  Another  re­
port (11) demonstrated  that pre and post calving  plane of nutrition  
have a cumulative  effect  on fertility.  The effect  of a low post calving  
feeding  level is increased  when proceeded  by a low pre calving  plane  of 
nutrition.
Pre and post calving  plane of nutrition  was examined  in Moorepark  
over two years. Animals  were fed on a high or a low plane of nutrition  
for eight weeks pre and eight weeks post calving  according  to treat ­
ment. The high plane before  and the high plane (H-H) after calving  
consisted  of 2.4 lbs of D.M. per 100 lb body  weight  from silage and 
eight lb of meals before  calving  and 2.8 lb of D.M. per 100 lb body-  
weight  plus 16 lb of meals after calving. The low plane pre and post 
calving  (L-L) consisted  of 1.5 lb of D.M. from silage alone pre calving  
and 2.0 lb of D.M. from silage plus 4 lb of meals after calving. The 
results (Table 6) show that animals  on a high-low  plane of nutrition  
(H-L) and losing 3.2 lb per day post calving  (16%) had a calving  to con­
ception  interval  (C.C.I.)  of 80 days and a conception  rate to first ser­
vice natural  service  of 75%. This does not concur  with other  work (9) 
on the subject. All groups  even those on the Low-Low  plane of nut­
rition had a calving  conception  interval  of less than 85 days, thereby  
allowing  a calving  to calving  interval  of 365 days. It should  be ment ­
ioned that all groups  gained  or maintained  weight  before  calving  and all 
lost weight  to varying  degrees  post calving.

The conclusion  to be drawn from this trial is that good silage "ad 
lib" before calving  and silage plus 4-8 lb of meals after calving  until 
animals  go to grass are sufficient.  It can also be concluded  that either  
nutritional  stress is not an important  factor in the fertility  of spring  
calving  cows or that bodyweight  changes  are a poor measure  of this 
stress.

5. ARTIFICIAL  INSEMINATION  AND NATURAL  SERVICE
The Conception  Rates achieved  by Artificial  Insemination  are gen­
erally lower than those from natural service (12,13). Some sources  
(13) found the differences  to be as great as 15% in favour  of Natural  
Service.
The reasons  why A.I may have lower conception  rates than natural  
service  are many. These  include;
1. Accuracy  of heat detection
2. Individual  A.I. operators
3. Time  of Insemination
4. Calving  service  interval
5. The use of fresh or frozen  semen. It is reported  that conception  
rates with deep frozen  semen are 5 to 10% lower  than with fresh  
semen  used on the same day (15,16).
6. The number  of times a bull serves a cow during  heat can in­
fluence  the conception  rate.
7. Data  on natural  service  may include  animals  first bred to A.I. but 
then bred to the bull and included  as a first service  to the bull. 
This would lengthen  the Calving  Service Interval  and increase  
conception  rate.
A.I. and natural service were compared  in a trial conducted  at 
Moorepark  under controlled  conditions.  The frozen  semen  used was 
taken from the bulls to be used for natural  service. Animals  were  
allofcated  to treatments  on the basis of similarity  in lactation  number  
and calving  date. All animals  were allowed  50 days after calving  before  
service. Animals  for A.I. in heat in the morning  were served that 
afternoon  and animals  ip heat in the afternoon  were served  the follow ­
ing morning. Heat observations  were carried  out five times daily.  
Animals  for natural  service  were served  once when they were in heat.
The results  of this experiment  (Table  7) indicate  that A.I. is as good  
as natural  service  under these conditions.  It is perhaps  important  to 
note that only one A.I. operator  was used. The animals  assigned  to 
natural  service  in Hard 1 had a shorter  calving  service  interval  as some  
animals  were served  on the first heat post calving.

NUMBER  OF SERVICES  PER BULL PER DAY AND PER WEEK
Roberts  (19) reports  that services  per bull per week varies  from four 
to 12. At Moorepark  a trial was conducted  in which  records  were kept 
on the number  of cows served  per day by each bull and the resulting  
conceptions.  The cows were "hand  mated"  and served  only once by 
the bull. When the bulls were in daily use two cows were usually  the 
maximum  number  that conceived  in one day even though  four may 
have been served. However  one bull after a four day rest served  five 
and four conceived. From this it would appear  that frequent  short  
periods  of rest are desirable.
The number  of animals  involved  in the trial was small. Table  8 gives  
the number  of services  per bull per week. Seven  conceptions  were the 
maximum  achieved  by any of the four bulls per week.

Some farmers with bulls at free range are achieving  better results. 
However  it is important  to remember  that there is a limit to a bull's  
performance,  if one is to achieve  a compact  calving  season. Therefore  
in a herd with 70 cows^cajved,  the number  of cows that can come on 
heat in any one day is~?0/21  or 3.3. In this case a bull may have to 
serve over three cows per day. A second  bull should  be used on an 
alternate  day basis in order to obtain maximum  fertility.
Semen  was collected  from two of the bulls used in this experiment  
on the same /ota as they had mated cows. Twelve  ejaculates  were
83
taken from bull A.F.T. The average  volume  of semen was 3.5 cc 
(table 9) containing  an average  of 0.17 billion (10^) spermatazoa  per 
cc. The number  of spermatazoa  required  for fertilization  is five to 
ten million  per cc using  fresh semen. Thus it would  seem that numbers 
of sperm were not responsible  for only seven animals  conceiving.  
However,  the volume  per ejaculate  is small and this may have some  
effect  on sperm  transport  and conception  rate.
SEMEN  COLLECTION  FREQUENCY
In most Irish A.I. Stations  semen is collected  from bulls once or 
twice per week. The total number  of inseminations  per bull in this 
country  is less than half the New Zealand  figure  (16). The conception  
rate for first inseminations  with liquid semen  was 66.9%  and 62% for 
deep frozen  semen. Each dose of 0.5 ml contained  2.5 million  sperm.  
This is about one tenth of the dose needed  for deep frozen semen.
It is thought  however  that frequent  collection  from bulls has adverse  
effect on both bulls and semen. However  Hafs (17) has shown  that 
daily ejaculation  of aged bulls for as long as eight months  is not harm ­
ful either  to the bulls or to the quality  of semen.
The increasing  demands  for sperm from genetically  superior  bulls  
will not be met by once or twice  weekly  collection  and the use of froz­
en semen also limits the numbers  inseminated  as the sperm require ­
ments  can be ten times  that of fresh semen.
The total number  of sperm collected  from one bull (Bull A.F.T.  
Table  8) in one week was as follows:

Taking  the average  of 70% motility  30.94 billion  sperm  per week were  
produced.  This represents  a potential  100,000  breedings  per bull per 
year using 10 million  motile  sperm  per insemination.
It would appear  that daily collection  and the use of a fresh semen  
service  during  the peak breeding  months  would  maximise  the use of our 
best bulls. Semen  collected  in excess  of the daily requirements  could  
be deep frozen.
84
INFERTILE  AND REPEAT  BREEDER  COWS
Reproductive  disorders  account  for 22% of cows culled. In order  
to ascertain  why animals  are infertile,  a post mortem  examination  was 
carried  out on the uteri and ovaries  of infertile  and repeat  breeders  cull­
ed from the Moorepark  herds. Table 10 shows  that even though  all 
animals  were examined  before  being  culled  four (7%) were in fact preg­
nant. It is probably  much  greater  in commercial  herds  where  pregnan ­
cy diagnosis  is not carried  out as a routine. All the other animals  ex­
cept one had a history  of regularly  repeating  to services. Some had 
been served  by bull and A.I. up to nine times. The main feature  to be 
noted is that only 14 (27%) had any macroscopic  abnormalities  which  
would interfere  with fertility. Only one animal  had inactive  ovaries.  
A recent abbatoir  survey (18) showed  that 52% of ovaries  examined  
were inactive.

It would  be concluded  that the 73% which  had no abnormalities  would  
eventually  go in calf if left long enough  in the herd. However,  in­
formation  on the hormone  status of these animals  would  add a desir ­
able dimension  to our knowledge  and possibly  lead to the development  
of therapy  which  would  get them in calf earlier.
SUMMARY
Farmers  should  strive for a compact  calving  system  in their herds  
by (1) accurate  heat detection;  (2) submitting  as many animals  as pos­
sible for insemination  during  the first few weeks  of the breeding  season  
and (3) by culling  or carrying  over late calvers  or animals  difficult  to 
get in calf. Pregnancy  diagnosis  should  be carried  out before  culling.  
Proper  animal  identification  is also very desirable.
Cows should  be fed good quality  silage "ad lib" before  calving  and 
the silage should  be supplemented  with 4-8 lb of meals after calving  
until they are transferred  to spring  grass. The genetic  merit  of the herd 
is improved  by using the best bulls from the A.I. stations  but this de­
pends on their availability.

Control  of Brucellosis  
in Intensive  Farming
B. Cunningham,  Veterinary  College,  Ballsbridge,  Dublin  4.
For many years Brucellosis  was known  under  the name of Contag ­
ious Abortion  and about  the only two things  that one can say with un­
qualified  certainty  are;
1. That it is very contagious
2. That the only clinical  symptom  in cattle  is abortion.
It would be readily manageable  if exposure  to infection  led to
(a) prompt  abortion  within  a few days or weeks
or (b) the early development  of positive  blood  titres
or (c) a positive  reaction  to some other type of test such as the tuber ­
culin reaction  in Tuberculosis.
Unfortunately  none of these things happen  with any degree  of reg­
ularity. In fact they are often the exception  rather than the rule.
NATURE  OF THE DISEASE
Whilst most infected  cows abort only once the disease becomes  
chronic  and such animals  become  symptomless  carriers. Even when 
subsequent  pregnancies  in such cows run full term the foetal tissues  
and fluids may be grossly  infected  and cause  fresh dangerous  spread  of 
the disease.
Worst still, some apparently  non-infected  (serologically  negative)  
heifers  or cows may carry full term, spread  gross infection  and be re­
cognised  as being infected  only some weeks later. When this happens  
in a herd the results  can be quite disastrous  as precautions  taken at a 
"normal"  calving are often minimal. The sequel is often the com­
mencement  of a serious  abortion  storm some two months  after the 
event in the in-contact  gravid  animals. (This is becuase  the minimum  
incubation  period  is about  40-50  days).
SEROLOGICAL  TESTS
As far as serological  tests are concerned  they basically  identify  ani­
mals which are receiving  sufficient  antigenic  stimulus  to produce  anti­
87
bodies,  but all infected  animals  do not fall into this category.  Some  
of the exceptions  are:
1. The incubation  period  of the disease  in pregnancy  can vary from  
one to nine months  so that animals  exposed  up to nine months  
previously  may not yet react to tests, may calve normally  and 
spread  infection.
2. Quite apart from the long incubation  period there is also the 
phenomenon  of latency  - whereby  an animal  may carry infection  
from its early youth,  pass all routine  serological  tests and then 
abort during  its first pregnancy.
3. Some cows effect  a recovery  from infection  in as much as blood  
titres may fall to negative  levels  over a few years. Unfortunately  
many such apparently  negative  animals  shed small numbers  of 
organisms  and may be the cause of a future breakdown  when  
the herd has been clear of bruclllosis  sometimes  for years.
4. Vaccination  can produce  some confusing  blood pictures,  the in­
terpretation  of which requires  a high degree  of skill. Despite 
these exceptions  brucellosis  can be eradicated.
Let us examine  some salient  features  of the disease  and from these  
try to plan a campaign  to suit our particular  circumstances.
CLASSICAL  PATTERN
The exposure  of unprotected  pregnant  heifers  or cows almost  cert­
ainly leads to abortion. The incubation  period  may be from one to 
nine months  and some blood titres may become  positive  only after  
abortion. The usual mode of infection  is by ingestion  but there may 
not be sufficient  organisms  to set up either infection  or antibody  pro­
tection  in the dams tissues. Thus,  serological  tests may remain  neg­
ative. However  a very small number  of organisms  migrating  to the 
uterus during  pregnancy  is quite sufficient  to set up an infection  there.  
The target  site is the foetal placenta  in which infection  causes  necrosis  
of the cotyledons.  Secondly,  a small number  of organisms  can set up 
infection  in the udder. In the milking  cow a positive  milk ring test 
may then be the first indication  of infection.  At parturition  leakage  of 
large numbers  of organisms  from the uterus  occurs  across the cotyle ­
dons into the bloodstream  and causes  bacteraemia.  It may then take 
up to 19 days for the animal  to give a positive  serological  test. The 
bacteraemia  may also cause gross infection  of the udder,  and in fact it 
has been found that about 90% of infected  cows are infected  in the 
udder. For this reason the milk ring test is highly efficient  in de­
tecting  the infected  cow.
88
EXPOSURE  OF THE NON-PREGNANT  HEIFER
This usually leads to, at most, temporarily  positive  blood titres.  
The infection  is rapidly overcome  and titres usually fall to negative  
levels over a period  of months. It is the exception  and not the rule for 
the non-pregnant  heifer to develop  persisting  positive  titres. Expos ­
ure of non-pregnant  heifers  can lead to one or two things
(a) Natural  immunity  in over 90% of heifers  and
(b) Latency  in something  less than 10%.
The important  of these two effects  is quite different  when we are 
attempting  to control  the disease  as opposed  to their importance  in 
the final stages  of eradication.
VACCINATION
Whether  SI 9 or K45/20  is used, one gets approximately  the same  
degree  of protection  which is "about  70% against  a reasonable  level of 
challenge".  This is not as good as we would  like and there seems  to be 
not much hope of producing  a better  vaccine. It is an unfortunate  fact 
that it is very difficult  to produce  a good vaccine  from any gram ­
negative  organism. (E.coli,  Vibrio  Cholera,  Salmonella,  etc.). Thus 
the protection  afforded  bv vaccination  will be as good as the chance  
we give it and it will not stand up to massive  challenge.  However,  
vaccination  can be a very big help in controlling  the disease.
SOME BASIC  CONSIDERATIONS  IN TRYING  TO CONTROL  THE  
DISEASE
So far we can see that;
1. The pregnant  animal  is highly  susceptible  to infection
2. The  non-pregnant  animal  is highly  resistant
3. We can supply  a modicum  of protection  by vaccination
Under normal management  conditions  the young stock are reared  
apart so that even in heavily  infected  herds they usually  test out well.  
In the initial stages of control  they can be vaccinated  and left so until 
they are served. The first step in controlling  the disease  must be to 
protect  pregnant  animals  against  exposure. Basically  this means  that 
no female is allowed  to calve or abort in the presence  of other preg­
nant females,  because  the foetal fluids and placenta  carry enormous  
numbers  of bacteria.
Another  piece of information  which  can be applied  is:
(a) Heifers  exposed  in the first third of pregnancy  tend to carry  
nearly  or to full term.
89
(b) Heifers  exposed  in mid-term  tend to abort 40-50 days later
(c) Heifers exposed  in late term tend to carry to full term but 
are usually  then found  to be infected.
Even if one cannot  isolate each animal for parturition  one should  
segregate  pregnant  animals  in groups according  to their stage of preg­
nancy and remember  that economically  at least the ones in the 4-6 
months  range are the most vulnerable.  This is a rational  approach  to 
limiting  spread of infection. There should  always  be some isolation  
boxes on a farm - one should  aim that all parturitions  take place in 
them and that they are cleansed  and disinfected  after each event. Al­
most any disinfectant  is effective  against  Brucella  abortus  as long as the 
organism  is not protected  by dirt or organic  matter  - so cleansing  is also 
important.
The bulk of infection  is in the foetal membranes  and fluids. These  
are normally  passed within a few hours of parturition.  Involution  
takes place within a few days after the expulsion  of placenta. After  
this, the rate of excretion  is not great and should not unduly  affect  
vaccinated  animals. Thus it is better  to have all females  in for the act 
of calving  rather than keep in a few for three weeks. It is most im­
portant  that all females  are effectively  vaccinated.
THE MILK  RING  TEST
The MRT does not suffer  from the same deficiencies  as serological 
tests in the vaccinated  herd. It is uninfluenced  by K45/20A  vaccinat ­
ion and this was one of the reasons  why;
(a) In  1967 it was decided  to ban SI9 and use K45/20A  vaccine
(b) Conversely,  that the MRT was chosen  as the best method  of 
diagnosis  of the disease  in the heavily  infected  areas.
The MRT has the following  advantages;
(a) It is cheap,  rapid and easy to perform.
(b) It detects  only antibodies  in the milk - so that it will detect  
90% of infected  cows (and these are the dangerous  90%).
(c) It avoids  "overkilling"  in a vaccinated  or infected  populat ­
ion.
The Pre-Intensive  Scheme  is an excellent  Scheme  designed  to eliminate  
the dangerous  infected  animals. It is not an eradication  scheme  but if 
successful  will have two great benefits  to the farmer;
90
It will make eradication  possible  more  quickly  and
Because the farmer is not obliged to dispose of reactors 
immediately  (as is required  under  the Blood  Test and Slaughter  
Scheme)  it will allow him to retain an optimal level of 
production  as he controls  the disease. In doing so is less 
likely that farmers  who avail of the scheme  will be subjected  
to severe financial  stress when the Blood Test and Slaughter  
methods  are introduced.
SOME DIFFICULTIES
1. Intensification  leads to greater contact  and to more rapid
spread of a contageous  disease (Contageous  Abortion). In 
fact under some intensive  systems  control  may be extremely  
difficult.
2. Good management  is essential  for progress  in any herd,  wheth ­
er dairy or beef.
3. It is easier to get rid of the disease  in spring-calving  milk-  
producing  herds than in those supplying  liquid milk the year 
round. The synchronisation  of calving  assists in this as one 
has a period  of six months  or more to carry out tests when no 
animal  can abort  to upset  the validity  of the tests.
4. In single suckled  herds with calvings  synchronised  over a short  
period the same remarks apply. But if one is thinking  
about the state of affairs where the bull runs loose the year 
round  with a large number  of females  (a system  of nil-manage ­
ment) - one must think seriously  and decide  whether  one is 
in farming  as a business  or merely  as an idle hobby.
CONCLUSIONS
The total eradication  of brucellosis  is a rational  National  objective  
which will primarily  be of benefit  to the farmer,  and to a lesser  extent  
to the community*
Compensation  and support  for the eradication  of the disease  is pro­
vided out of public  funds to which we all contribute.  It should  be a 
matter  of concern  and conscience  to all that the aim should  be to de­
plete the national  herd as little as possible  and to avoid undue  hardship  
on the individual  farmer. These are difficult  objectives  to contend  
with when dealing  with this type of disease. But all these  factors  have 
been considered  in deciding  to tackle the problem  in the Southern  
Counties  on a two stage basis.
91
Stage 1. is the Pre-Intensive  Control  Scheme  and
Stage 2. will be the familiar  Test and Slaughter  policy  of Eradicat ­
ion.
The Pre-Intensive  Scheme  is strongly  recommended.  It offers  a way 
of virtually  eliminating  the disease  whilst still maintaining  maximum  
production.  It may suffer  from some defects,  but is not a final state­
ment. Some amendments  will inevitably  be made,  and with frankness 
in discussion  and due consideration  of difficulties  it may be possible  to 
improve  it. Control  of brucellosis  is not easy and demands  hard work  
from both farmers  and vets.
Basically  it is the job of the Veterinary  profession  to assist farmers  
by studying  this particular  problem  - conditions  vary from farm to farm-  
carrying  out and interpreting  appropriate  tests, formulating  a workable  
plan of campaign  and then monitoring  progress  in regular  consultation  
with farmers. As progress  is made  tactics  may also need to be changed,  
as also will the severity of interpretation  of supplementary  tests.
Nevertheless  nobody  but the farmer  can control  brucellosis  in his 
herd. It must be tackled  methodically,  and it entails  many things  
which may be simply  expressed  as good management.  Some  necessary  
details  are:
1. Accurate  records (Date of birth, tag number,  service  dates,  
calving  dates,  identity  of calf, vaccination  dates,  etc.)
2. Provision  for Isolation  at parturition
3. Cleansing  and disinfection  of any housing  and potentially  dan­
gerous materials  before removing  for safe disposal  (foetuses,  
placentae,  foetal  fluids).
4. Provision  for group isolation  during  pregnancy  and a watchful  
eye on all pregnant  animals  for any sign of impending  parturit ­
ion.
5. Keep  boundaries  and internal  fencing  in good repair.
To these I would  add:
(a) Do not buy in female replacements  - particularly  pregnant  
ones and
(b) Love thy neighbour  as thyself
Farming  and County  organisations  have a part to play and they 
should  encourage  their farmers  to go ahead  with control  where  possible
92
on an area basis and they should  bring pressure  to bear on both offend ­
ers and stragglers.
To meet the requirements  of E.E.C. directives  we must be free of 
Brucellosis  by 1978 - otherwise  we will have serious  difficulties  not 
alone in external  trade but also in the traditional  internal  movement  
patterns  of the cattle  trade.

DEVELOPMENT  OF BEEF AND DAIRY  BUILDINGS  IN 
NORTHERN  IRELAND  AND SOME  OF THE PROBLEMS
D.S. Magill,
Farm Buildings  Section,
Ministry  of Agriculture,  Belfast.
There has been a dramatic  expansion  in the number  of suckler  cows  
in Northern  Ireland  while dairy cow numbers  continue  to increase  
steadily. The current  annual  expenditure  in farm buildings  is about  £8 
million  of which more than half is spent  on buildings  for cattle. Herds  
of 100 to 200 cows or beef units of 500 to 1,000  cows are not un­
common.
The quantity  of silage  conserved  has trebled  during  the last six years.  
Self feeding  was the most common  method  of feeding  silage but easy 
feeding  associated  with open silos has now become  popular  particularly  
in beef fattening  units. Open silos are not popular  with self feeding  
because  of the increased  volume  of slurry to be collected  and stored.
Cubicle  and slatted  floor housing  systems  have allowed  farmers  to 
house cattle in larger  numbers.  Sufficient  straw  for bedding  is no long­
er available. Slatted  floors  are installed  between  rows of cubicles  to 
eliminate  the daily chore  of scraping  yards.
Although  three months  storage  of slurry is accepted  practice,  an in­
creasing  number  of farmers  are expanding  storage  capacity  to cater for 
the entire  winter  period. Storage  of slurry  is expensive  but is accepted 
in the interests  of the environment.  Storage  methods  vary from below  
ground  tanks  to above  ground  tanks.
Buildings  tend to be steel framed  Dutch barns with lean-to ’s. Al­
though timber  buildings  of the kennel  type were popular  a few years  
ago the cost differential  between  these and the more conventional  
buildings  has been reduced due to increasing  prices of timber.  
Proprietary  buildings  for cattle  are used very little compared  with the 
pig and poultry  industry. The exception  to this is the Masstock  build ­
ing. This development  arose from well tried slatted  floor systems  
established  here for some years.
Problems  which will affect building  developments  in future are:
1. Labour  Costs
2. Cost  of borrowing  money
3. Increased  building  costs
4. Level of grant
97
5.
6.Pollution  control
Planning  controls  on farm buildings  and amenity  considerat ­
ions.
Farm labour  is becoming  scarce  and expensive.  Improved  efficiency  
through  the further  use of buildings  is therefore  required. With cost 
of borrowing  money  at a record  level and building  costs rising at 20% 
to 30% per annum  farmers  are being  forced  to consider  cheaper  systems  
of housing  animals. Cheap housing  systems  must have a low labour  
requirement  and must satisfy  pollution  and other amenity  considerat ­
ions. It is doubtful  if a really cheap  system  can satisfy  all these re­
quirements.  Grants  under the Farm Capital  Grant  Scheme  have been 
reduced  from 40% to 20% for farm buildings. Under  the new EEC 
Scheme the grant rate will be 25% but will apply less widely.
The Water  Act was introduced  in 1972 for the purpose  of conserving 
water resources  and promoting  water cleanliness.  It means  that cases  
of pollution  of watercourses  by animal waste or silage effluent  are 
liable to prosecution.  In this regard silage effluent  presents  a major  
problem.
Planning  controls  for farm building?have  also been introduced.  On­
ly buildings  outside  the confines  of the principal  farmyard,  close to 
houses and roads, over 12 metres in height and more than 300 sq. 
metres  in area require  planning  permission.  It is anticipated  that this 
will not unduly  affect  the development  of farm buildings.
98
The  hidden  acres
Not so long ago any farmer  stirred  by ideas  
of progress  and expansion  had but one option:  
to buy more land Land  meant  everything.
With it he could  grow more  grass,  graze 
more  cattle,  conserve  more feed and produce  
more  milk, cream  and butter  for expanding  
towns  and cities.  Without  it he became  a 
prisoner,  confined  by a boundary  hedge  which  
marked  the extent  of his land and the limit 
of his prosperity.
The to that prison  lay in increased  
growth:  in discovering  and manufacturing  
nutrients  similar  to those  provided  by nature  
and then applying  them  in generous  
quantities  to a land starred  of life.
These  nutrients:  nitrogen,  potassium  and 
phosphorus  were  reproduced,  concentrated  and 
manufactured  in the form of granulated  
fertilizer  by NET  ArklowTo date NET fertilizers  have helped  to produce  
thousands  of unseen  acres  - land that grows  not 
in Size but in yield.  They  are the hidden  acres  and 
the hidden  wealth  of a growing Ireland.

THE RELATIVE  ECONOMICS  OF SPRING  AND  AUTUMN  
MILK  PRODUCTION
P.A. Gleeson,
Agricultural  Institute,
Moorepark,  Fermoy,
CO. CORK.
A three year experiment  with six autumn  and two spring calving 
herds was undertaken  to study the relative  costs of autumn  and spring  
milk production.  Each herd consisted  of 21 cows in a self contained  
farmlet  which  provided  grazing  and silage  for winter feed. The autumn  
calving  herds were arranged  in a factorial  arrangement  of three feeding  
levels during  the winter  period  as follows:  1.8 kg, 3.6 kg, and 5.4 kg of 
concentrates  per head per day and each feeding  level was stocked  at 
either 2.84 cows/hectare  or 3.53 cows/hectare.  The spring calving 
herds were fed 3.6 kg of concentrates  per day from the time of calving  
until they went to grass in mid-March  and were stocked  at either  2.84 
cows per hectare  or 3.53 cows per hectare. The autumn  calving  herds  
calved  over a three month  period  with a mean calving  date of 14 Sept ­
ember,  and the mean calving  date for the spring  herds was 14 March. 
All other management  practices  were similar  except  greater  quantities  
of silage  were cut for the autumn  calving  herds.
The land acreage  required  to carry both spring and autumn  herds  
was found  to be similar. Milk yields  were increased  as level of concen ­
trate feeding  increased  for the autumn  calving  herds. Milk production  
per cow was depressed  due to increased  stocking  rate but output  per 
hectare  was increased  at the higher  stocking  rates. The autumn  calving  
herds produced  more milk than the spring  calving  herds. The product ­
ion data obtained  were used to determine  the relative  costs of milk pro­
duction  under  both systems.

PROTEIN  SUPPLEMENTATION  OF GRASS  SILAGE  FOR  
DAIRY  COWS
T.M. BUTLER,
Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork
Ninety  Friesian  cows in early lactation  were used in an experiment  
to study the effects  of varying  the protein  content  of the concentrate  
used to supplement  grass silage. Concentrate  rations  based on barley  
and soyabean  meal were formulated  to contain  12, 15 and 18% crude 
protein. Each of these concentrates  was fed at 3.0, 5.5 and 8.0 kg per 
day to 10 lactating  cows for eight  weeks. The animals  were individual  - 
ly fed grass silage  ad libitum.
The protein  content  of the concentrate  ration  did not affect  silage  
dry matter  intake. At the lower and intermediate  levels of feeding,  
increasing  the protein  content  of the concentrate  tended  to reduce 
bodyweight  loss. At the higher level of feeding,  the animals  on the 
three protein  levels gained  bodyweight  during  the experimental  period.
Increasing  the concentrate  protein  from 12 to 15% resulted  in in­
creased  milk production  at the three levels of feeding  while elevating  
the protein  from 15 to 18% increased  milk production  only at the 
higher  level of feeding. The protein  content  of the concentrate  had no 
consistent  effect  on milk fat or protein  content.

EFFECTS  OF CROSSING  FINNISH  LANDRACE  AND  
GALWAY  SHEEP
J.P. Hanrahan,  Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuam, Co. Galway  
G.J. More O'Ferrall,  Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  
Co. Dublin.
Ewes producing  twins are biologically  more efficient  than ewes pro­
ducing  singles. Since the frequency  of twinning  is low in the Galway 
breed the most important  goal in breed improvement  is higher litter  
size. The results  of Fingalway  evaluation  (V2 Finn x Vi Galway)  show 
that the most immediate  way to improve  Galway  sheep is through  the 
introduction  of Finn genes. Data were summarised  for the years  
1971-'73. The average litter size for Fingalway  ewes was 2.0 
compared  with 1.4 for Galway  ewes. In addition  significantly  fewer  
Fingalway  ewes were barren.
The number  of lambs weaned  per ewe per year were measured  in 
two flocks  of ewes over a period  of three  years. The ewes were born in 
1968 and 1969 and in total represented  75 Fingalway  and 283 Galway  
ewes. The Fingalway  ewes weaned  on average  of 1.70 lambs/ewe/year.  
The corresponding  figure for Galway  ewes was 1.23. Data from 14 
breeders  flocks  wherein  Galway  and Fingalway  hoggets  produced  lambs  
supported  these results with an extra 0.50 lambs weaned  per ewe. 
While lambs weaned  per ewe per year is the most important  trait, lamb  
growth  is also important. A progeny  test of Galway  and Fingalway  
rams yielded  average  weaning  weights  of 28.9 and 28.8 kg for Galway  
and Fingalway  sires, respectively.  Analysis  of lamb mortality  data has 
shown  no significant  differences  between  mortality  of Galway  and Fin­
galway  lambs born to Galway  ewes. Similarly,  there  was no difference  
between  the mortality  rates of twin lambs born to Galway  and Fingal ­
way ewes. Significantly  more V4 Finn x % Galway  ewe lambs  produced  
lambs in their first year than did Galway  ewe lambs (57 vs 26%).
The fleece weights  of Galway  and Fingalway  hoggets  averaged  2.9 
and 2.7 kg, respectively.  The results  quoted  show  that the Finn sheep  
population  is a very useful source  of genetic  material  for improving  the 
Galway  sheep  breed.

CONTROL  OF THE OESTRUS  CYCLE  OF THE BOVINE
J.F. Roche,  Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
Effective  synchronisation  of the oestrus cycle in the bovine  
necessitates  control  of the functional  life span of the corpus  luteum  (a). 
Two approaches  towards  the control  of the corpus  luteum  were studied.
Firstly,  progesterone  was administered  by silastic implant  for 18 
days and effective  synchronisation  was obtained.  However,  fertility  to 
natural  mating  irrespective  of time and number  was low with 50% of 
heifers  conceiving.  Reducing  the period  of progesterone  administrat ­
ion from 18 to 9 days resulted  in normal  fertility,  based on slaughter  
and calving  data, but lower  oestrus  response  was obtained.  The oestrus  
response  was dependent  on the stage of the cycle at which treatment  
was initiated. Heifers  implanted  in the luteal phase all responded, 
while those implanted  shortly  after ovulation  or during  the follicular  
phase had a much lower synchronising  response.  Incorporating  differ ­
ent ratios of oestrogen  and progesterone  and increasing  the treatment  
period from 9 to 12 days, increased  the oestrus  response  up to 80% 
without  reducing  fertility. The mode of administration  of progester ­
one was studied  and a new technique  based on a silastic  intravaginal  
device  has been developed.  Retention  rate in both cows and heifers  is 
high and effective  synchronisation  with progesterone  has also been ob­
tained.
The second approach  involved the intramuscular  injection  of 
prostaglandin  F2 alpha after the fifth day of the oestrus  cycle. One 
injection  of either  20 or 30 mg PGF2  alpha  was used. Neither  the dose 
of PGF2 or the stage of cycle affected  the high heat response  obtained  
with this injection. Fertility  following  one insemination  of frozen  
semen was the same in PGF2 alpha treated  heifers  and non-treated  
control  heifers.

COMPARISON  OF NORTH  AMERICAN  HOLSTEIN  AND  
EUROPEAN  FRIESIAN  DAIRY  CATTLE
E.P. Cunningham,  Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,
Co. Dublin.
Over the past 25 years, Irish dairy farmers  have gradually  changed  
from Shorthorn  to Friesian  cows and obtained  about  a 20% increase  in 
output per cow as a result. Can this kind of gain be made again?  
The evidence  on the merit of Holsteins  suggests  that it can. The 
average  recorded  yields of Holsteins  in the U.S.A. are about 140%  
above  that of Friesian  cows in Ireland. Most of this difference  is due 
to feeding but there is evidence  that there is a genetic  difference  
amounting  to 20% to 30%. This evidence  comes  from several  Europ ­
ean countries  and is of three  kinds
1. Comparisons  of daughters  of Holstein  bulls tested  in Europe  with 
normal  European  Friesians
2. Comparisons  of progeny  tests of Holstein  bulls tested  in the U.S. 
and in Europe.
3. Comparisons  of imported  pure Holsteins  and local European  Frie­
sians
The general  indication  from 12 such published  reports  is that com­
pared to European  Friesians  the Holsteins  are 20% to 30% more 
productive  in milk, about the same for fat and protein  %, at least as 
good in growth  and feed efficiency,  but perhaps  poorer  in beef con­
formation. Data on Canadian  bulls tested in the U.S.A.  suggest  that 
the U.S. Holstein  population  is about 6% better for milk production  
than the Canadian.
