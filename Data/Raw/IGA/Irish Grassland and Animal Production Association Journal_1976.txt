Systems  of Beef Production
by
A. CONWAY.
The A/^ricultural  Institute,  Johnstown  Castle, Wexford.
The returns  from farms in cattle production  in Ireland  are not very 
impressive  either in terms of economic  return  or number  of cattle pro­
duced  per farm. A stocking  rate of three acres/beast  is a long way from 
the potential  of Irish grassland.  This paper highlights  some of the key 
factors  which  are limiting  the returns  on farms in beef production.
It is possible  to make  money  from cattle production  in Ireland  without  
having  either much technical  input or without  having high output of 
liveweight  gains per acre. In Table I two systems  are shown  which  were 
run on two 60 acre units.

In the first system,  weaners  were bought  in and finished  as beef and 
in the second,  stores  were bought  in winter  and sold before  the following 
June. Although  liveweight  gain in the latter was only 40 percent  of 
that of the first system,  gross margin  per acre is practically  similar  and 
net margin  per acre is exactly  similar. In other years,  there were higher 
returns  from No. 2 system. Thus under Irish conditions  technical  effi­
ciency  and economic  efficiency  do not go hand in hand. It must,  however, 
be admitted  that No. 2 system  carries  a fair amount  of risk which many 
farmers  may not be prepared  to take. But we must accept that if we 
want to produce  beef all stages  of that production  cycle must be carried  
out on farms in Ireland  and there must be an economic  return at all 
stages  of that production  cycle.
Let us now consider  production  systems. It is necessary  to clarify 
two points :
i) Most  of the calves  in this country  are born in spring;
ii) From  the calf stage to the final finish stage,  an animal  will change 
hands a number  of times. It is unusual  for the bought-in  calf 
to be reared  and fattened  on the same farm. There is a tendency  
for the smaller  producer  to buy and rear calves  for sale as stores  
and for the bigger producer  to buy stores for fattening  and sale 
as finished  beef.
A typical  spring  bom calf, from birth to slaughter,  will probably  have 
the following  liveweight  pattern  at different  ages as shown  in Table 2 
for systems  A and B. From birth to eight months  calves are generally  
well fed, but on some farms they may be affected  by parasites  and per­
formance  may be reduced  so that at eight months  there is a difference 
of say, 70 lb liveweight,  between  systems  A and B. In system  A wean ­
lings initially  weighed  350 lb, and 420 lb in B. System  A cattle event ­
ually finish at 32 months  of age and system  B cattle  at 29 months  of age.

On the other hand, if system  B is compared  with the Grange  system, 
it is found that at eight months  of age the weanling  cattle are the same 
weight  as those in system B but over the first winter  the performance  
of the Grange  cattle is 70 lb better. At the end of the grazing  season,  
this difference  is reduced  to 50 Ib. but over the second  winter,  system  B 
cattle are fed to maintain  liveweight,  whereas  the Grange  system  cattle  
are fed to gain liveweight  and consequently  reach slaughter  weight at 
25 months  of age.
The costs of calf rearing  are shown in Table 3. It will be seen that 
the average  cost of rearing  a calf from birth to eight months  is £30.

It will be noted that total silage used in systems  A and B is similar  
(8 tons) whereas  in the Grange  system,  the total silage  amounts  to 11 tons. 
The extra silage in the latter system  is accounted  by 0.5 tons in the first 
winter  and 2.5 tons in the second  winter. In order to obtain  this extra  
silage 0.18 acres per beast or 36 percent  more land must be cut twice  
in the Grange  system  as compared  with systems  A and B. It will also 
be noted  that in systems  A and B no barley  is fed. whereas  in the Grange  
system  a total of eight cwt. is fed (2 cwt. the first winter  and 6 cwt. the 
second winter)  during winter. The land requirement  during different 
stages  of the animal ’s life is shown  in Table 7.

Except  for silage,  there is no difference  between  the three systems  up 
to the24months  old stage when theGrange  cattle  are sold out fat. Systems 
A and B cattle must go to grass for another  season in order to finish  
as beef (A by November  and B by August). This means  that the total 
land requirement  per finished  beast is 1.71 acres for system A, 1.62 
acres for system  B and 1.14 for the Grange  system. If these land require ­
ments  are divided  into 100 acres,  we get the total number  of cattle which 
could be produced  from such a size farm (Table  8).

It will be seen that system A would produce  58 cattle, system B— 
62 cattle, the Grange  system —88 cattle. Thus, for feeding  an extra  
3 tons of silage and feeding  a total of 8 cwt. of barley,  the throughput  
of cattle would  increase  from 58 or 62 to 88 head on a 100 acre farm. 
The feed costs for each period  are set out in Table 9.

It will be noted that the main difference  in costs up to 24 months  
between  the Grange  system and the other two systems  occurs during  
the winter  period. This amounts  to £6 the first winter  and £30 the second  
winter but this extra expenditure  (£36) resulted  in a land saving per 
finished  beast of 0.57 acres when compared  with system A. and 0.48 
acres when compared  with system  B. The total feed costs per finished  
beast would  be £92 for A and £90 for B and £110 for the Grange  system  
(Table 10).

Since systems  A and B cattle are sold late in the season,  they are 
valued  4p per Ib less than the Grange  system  cattle. The gross output  
from the three systems  amounts  to £11,496  for A, £12,958  for B and 
£20,680  for the Grange  system. After allowing  for feed costs and labour  
(£3.000),  this leaves a corresponding  return on investment  of £3,015,  
£4,378  and £8.000  for systems  A, B and Grange  respectively.  This is 
a difference  of £3,600  between  system  B and the Grange  system. This 
difference  in favour  of the Grange  system  is due to two factors,  namely,  
a greater  margin per beast but much more important,  it is due to a 
greater  throughput  of cattle per 100 acres —88 v 62 or 58. The stocking  
rate factor is the most important  one, and it cannot be overstressed.  
In the systems  de.'^cribed,  the higher  stocking  rate was carried  by reduc ­
ing the slaughtering  age from 32 months  to 25 months  and the latter  
was achieved  by providing  an extra three tons of silage per finished 
beast per year and supplementing  with eight cwt of barley.
The key factor therefore  in cattle production  at farm level is winter  
feed supply (silage and concentrates).  It cannot  be denied  that if this 
part of the system  of production  (calf to finish)  is adequately  taken care 
of, then the returns  will be much greater  than from those systems  where 
a haphazard  approach  is adopted  to winter  feed supply.
The invisible  Ireland
To the city dweller  it is an unfamiliar  world  of 
planting  and harvesting, of strange  tasks  and 
strangerwords.
To all it means  the miracle  of fertilizer-  
the phenomenon of Increased  growth  from  the 
same  amount  of land.  At one time a farmer's 
output  was restricted  by the amount  of land he 
owned,  the number  of cattle  grazed,  the volume  
of wheat  harvested.  All was governed  by a 
stone  wall marking  the end of his property  and the 
limit  of his opportunity.
But stone  walls  could  not confine  man's 
ingenuity.  The nutrients  that power  growth  were  
defined, harnessed  and manufactured.
Today,  in Ireland, NET  fertilizers  are creating  
thousands  of invisible  acres  - land that grows  
not in size,  but in yield.To the farmer  fertilizer  means  a better  way  of 
life. To everyone  it means  a vital contribution  to life 
itself . . . a tool for food.

Winter  Beef Production  —
Reeorcied  Results  on Coinmercial  Farms
by
M. BARLOW.
Department  of Agriculture  and Fisheries,  Dublin.
The levels of performance  of silage fed cattle on commercial  farms in 
Ireland  has been described'^'.  It was shown  that the average  daily gain 
(ADG)  at 0.6 lb per head was substantially  below what was expected  
from the quality  of the silages  fed. Analyses  of the data failed  to explain  
adequately  the reason  for poor animal  performance.  A major variable,  
namely  silage intake,  which could have a significant  effect on perform ­
ance, was not measured.  Accordingly,  a study was undertaken  to 
measure  silage intake  during  the winter  of 1974-75. This paper  presents  
a brief account  of the study.
Silage intake was estimated  as follows;  all animals  were individually  
weighed  on two occasions,  i.e. about two weeks  after the start of winter  
feeding  and towards  the end of winter  feeding. Only groups  which  were  
expected  to have in excess of 70 days between  the two weighings  were 
selected  for the study. The volume  of silage displaced  between  first and 
second  weighings  was measured.  The volume  of silage waste was also 
measured.  It was then possible  to establish  the nett volume  of silage  
consumed  (a). The silage was sampled  with a corer of known  internal  
volume  and the silage in the corer was weighed  at time of sampling. 
This allowed  the weight  of silage per unit of volume  to be calculated  (b). 
The dry matter  percentage  of the silage was obtained  from the chemical  
analyses  (c). The total number  of feed days was calculated  by multiply ­
ing the number  of cattle in the group  (d). The weight  used in calculating  
the percentage  of dry matter intake was the average  of the animals  
mid-way  between  first and second  weighings.  This was derived  by adding  
half the total gain between  these two weighings  to the average  weight  of 
the animals  at first weighing  (e). The formula  used for calculating  the 
dry matter  per 100 Ib of body weight  was therefore  as follows:

Table I gives details  of the study. Table 2 gives the average  chemical  
analysis  of the silages. The recorded  and expected  intakes  are given  
in Table 3.
It is clear that intake  is substantially  below  that expected  from a truly  
ad libitum  system. Against  this background  of only 75% to 80% of the

It appears  that low intake was the major cause of the poor animal  
performance  recorded  in this study. It may be reasonable  to assume  
that low silage intake was the major cause of the poor performance  
recorded  in previous  years.
It should be borne in mind that since the results relate to only 18 
groups of animals  they must be regarded  as tentative. Further  work 
along similar  lines is planned  for the coming  winter.

Future  Prospects  for Single Suckling  
under Lowland  Conditions
by
M. DRENNAN.
Ayrk  iilliiral  Institute,  Gronye,  Dimsany,  Co. Meath.
High calf prices are attractive  to the dairy farmer in the short-term  
but in the long-term  are problematical  for Irish farming,  resulting  in 
cycles similar  to the early seventies  (excessively  high calf prices  in 1972 
and 1973 followed  by low prices in 1974 and 1975). The development  
of an organised  beef industry  with efficient  grassland  systems,  namely,  
taking calves from birth to slaughter,  would be very difficult  in such 
circumstances.  This would perpetuate  emphasis  on buying  and selling 
at the right time rather than emphasis  on efficient  production.
An important  question  for beef farmers  is whether  or not single  
suckling  can provide  reasonable  economic  returns. Before discussing  
this question.  1 will summarise  briefly the results from spring calving 
herds at Grange.
Cows calve in February/March  as it is important  to have the cow 
dry for most of the winter to keep feed costs low, and adequate  high 
quality  pasture  in spring  ensures  high fertility. In relation  to the cow, 
stocking  rate during the grazing  season and winter feed requirements  
are the mo.st important  considerations.  In addition  to these two topics,  
other factors  influencing  calf performance  will also be discussed.
Stocking  rates
The overall  objective  is to obtain  high animal  performance  during  the 
grazing  season  and restrict  animals  if necessary  when the cost of provid ­
ing feed is greater. However,  stocking  rate is a major  factor  influencing 
returns  per acre. Therefore,  it is necessary  to obtain high production  
per acre (which means using high stocking  rates) in addition  to high 
performance  per animal  during  the grazing  season.
With a total input of about 160 units of fertilizer  nitrogen  per acre.  
Grange  results have shown that one cow (calving  in February/March)  
and her calf to 14-15 months  of age on 1.2 acres of pasture  can be 
carried. The approach  has been to stock heavily  when grass growth  
is highest  (May/June)  and close as much silage area as possible  for 
winter feed. Rotational  grazing  is practised,  commencing  about mid 
April when the calves are on average  about six weeks old. The effect  
of stocking  rate during  the period  from April to August  on calf perform ­
ance is shown  in Table 1.

Grazing  commenced  late in 1966 but the pasture  was controlled  from 
the start by a combination  of grazing  and cutting. Increasing  the stock ­
ing rate to 0.5 acre (high) resulted  in a decrease  in daily gain of the 
calves in 1967 only and this can be explained  by the fact that grazing 
commenced  early in that year (April 3). The grazing  schedule  for four 
years is shown  in Table  2 and satisfactory  calf performance  was obtained  
in all instances.  During  the period  from April to August,  approximately  
0.55 acres per cow and calf were required  for grazing. The remainder  
was cut twice for silage, about May 20 and again in late July. From  
a total of 1.2 acres per cow and calf, an average  of 0.65 acres can be 
cut twice for silage providing  a total of 9| tons of silage for the cow and 
weaned  calf in winter.

1972 „ 20 0.42 0.70 1.2 Nov 16
When trying to achieve  these high stocking  rates, grass supply can 
sometimes  be scarce  and can be overcome  by grazing  a small proportion  
of the silage  area and by allowing  the second  cut (cow silage)  to grow for 
a loiiger period to achieve  higher yields. Application  of nitrogenous  
fertilizer  to the grazed  area can also increase  feed supply  in a period  of 
scarcity.
From August  to the end of the grazing  season,  the stocking  rate must 
be reduced  in order to maintain  a high level of calf performance.  The 
effect of stocking  rate during  the latter part of the grazing  season  on calf 
performance  is .shown  in Table 3.

1968 (August  1 to Sept. 24) 2.1 1.6 1.2
The grazing  season  ended early each season  because  of the poor per­
formance  of animals  at the high stocking  rate. Each increase  in stocking  
rate resulted  in a decline  in calf gain during  all three years.  In this period,  
only those calves  at the low stocking  rate (I acre per cow and calf) con­
tinued to have satisfactory  liveweight  gains Thus, to ensure  good calf 
performance  during  the latter period  of the grazing  season  the stocking  
rate must be reduced  substantially.  In practice,  the entire  area (1.2 acres) 
would be grazed  during  this period.
The performance  of calves  from birth to weaning  is shown  in Table  4. 
Average  weight  at weaning  was almost  600 lb. The only extra feed 
was rolled barley (about ^ to | cwt per head) introduced  gradually  
during  the last 4-6 weeks  of the grazing  season.

Winter feeding  of the cows
In the system outlined,  mature suckler  cows are generally  in good 
body condition  at the start of winter. As the provision  of winter  feed 
is more costly than grazing  and as the feed requirements  of dry cows  
are low relative  to that of lactating  animals,  studies  were carried  out to 
determine  the extent  to which  feed could be restricted  during  late preg­
nancy. One group of mature  cows were individually  fed 60 lb silage 
per head daily during  the last 80-100  days of pregnancy.  A second  group  
were fed silage to appetite  during  the same period. All received  silage
19
to appetite  from calving  until grazing  commenced  and they were grazed 
together.
Medium  quality  silage (DM digestibility  = 67%. DM=19%)  was fed 
in 1970/71  but the silage used in 1971/72  was poor (DMD=61%.  
DM=17%).  The results  show (Table 5) that although  restricted  cows  
lost substantially  more weight  than their counterparts  during  late preg­
nancy. they gained faster subsequently  resulting  in only slight weight 
differences  after 180 days of lactation.

Although  the period  of restricted  feeding  was shorter  in 1971/72.  the 
liveweight  losses were much greater  than in the previous  year, due to 
the difference  in quality  and dry matter  of the silage fed. There was no 
effect of plane of nutrition  on calf birth-weights  or subsequent  calf per­
formance  (Table  6). This does not mean that calf birth-weights  cannot  
be influenced  by the pre-calving  plane of nutrition.  It shows however 
that there is a wide range within  which nutrition  of the cow only slightly  
influences  the weight  of the calf. Greater  weight losses in similar  type

cows or the same losses  with cows in poorer  condition  initially  have been 
shown to cause large reductions  in call' birth-weights.
Reductions  in pre-calving  nutrition  are likely to reduce  calving  diffi­
culties  and, particularly  with heifers,  animals  fed on high levels of nutri ­
tion prior to calving  have greater  calving  problems.  With the greater  
usage of the larger breeds,  calving  difficulties  will be higher  and thus,  
it will be more important  to avoid having the animals  fat at calving.  
As a general  rule, maintenance  of liveweight  during  the last three months  
of pregnancy  is quite adequate  for mature  cows. As a result of the 
weight  losses  at calving,  the cow will be about 120 Ib lighter  after calving 
than three months  earlier  which is far less severe  than the lower feeding 
levels in the above studies.
In these experiments,  cows were let to pasture  6-7 weeks  after calving 
and level of feeding  during  pregnancy  had no ill-effects  on subsequent  
fertility  despite  a total winter  weight  loss of as high as 250 lb (1971  /72 
low). However,  the period from calving  to fertile heat for both groups  
was delayed  somewhat  (83 days) in the latter study but was adequate  
to maintain  a calving  interval  of about one year. The delay was due to 
the poor quality  of the silage available  after calving  and because  this 
silage was fed for 50 days before grazing  started. The results  demon ­
strate the ability  of the cows to recover  satisfactorily  when subsequently  
provided  with adequate  high quality  pasture The animals  most sensitive 
to restricted  feeding  particularly  from the point of view of fertility  are 
hrst calvers  and these should not be restricted  in the manner  outlined  
for mature  cows.
Breeds
There is a high positive  correlation  between  growth  rate of the calf 
and milk production  of the dam and therefore,  a cow with relatively  
high milk production  capacity  is required. I consider  the progeny  of 
Hereford  or Angus bulls with Friesian  cows to be the most suitable  
suckler  cows.
Where  a crossbred  cow is used, the bull should  preferably  be from a 
third breed. The two most important  factors in relation  to the bull 
are high growth  potential  in the calves and a low incidence  of calving 
problems. In addition  to breed difference  for these factors,  there is 
tremendous  variation  within  any one breed. Thus, in selecting  the bull, 
the most important  point is to choose  one known  to have a low incidence 
of calving  problems.  In addition  to breed differences  for these factors,  
there is tremendous  variation  within  any one breed. Thus, in selecting 
the bull, a most important  point is to choose  one known  to have a low 
incidence  of calving  difficulties.  Considering  the potential  for faster  
calf growth  by using breeds  such as the Charolais  and the better market  
in Europe  for the leaner  carcasses  produced  from these breeds,  I consider  
that it is essential  in suckling  to use the continental  type bull breeds. 
Relative  to Hereford  bulls, an increase  in final liveweight  of up to 8 
percent  or 90 lb can be expected  by using the better,  late maturing  bull 
breeds. Where  a bull is not available,  these breeds  can be availed  of
21
by using A.I. Results  at Grange  during  the last few seasons  with spring 
calving  cows at pasture  have been good but we have not been as success­
ful when breeding  in winter. A vasectomized  bull with a chin-ball  
mating  device was used to detect heat and cows were inseminated  on 
the basis of paint marks. For those without  previous  experience,  it 
would  be advisable  to use A.I. for only the first six weeks  of the breeding  
season and then to turn out a bull. A.I. can also be availed  of by 
using heat synchronization  treatments.  Due to calving  difficulties,  it is 
not advisable  to use a fast growing  Continental  type bull on heifers.
Creep feeding  calves at pasture
The results  suggest  that a response  to creep feeding  or meal supple ­
mentation  can only be expected  under conditions  of pasture  scarcity. 
Because  of cost the only circumstances  under  which meal feeding  should  
be practised  is where the objective  is to finish the animals  in winter. 
For this, it is necessary  to feed up to one cwt of barley  during  the last 
4-6 weeks of the grazing  season in order to achieve  high meal intakes  
early in the winter  feeding  period.
Finishing  the calves
In the system  outlined,  adequate  silage is available  to feed both the 
cow and the calf in winter. Because  of market  fluctuations,  the producer  
of weaned  calves for sale in autumn  is in a very vulnerable  position  
and under  lowland  conditions  the calves  should  be fattened  on the farm. 
This may not be possible  under hill or marginal  land conditions  where 
the provision  of winter  feed causes problems.  At Grange,  fattening  of 
weaned  calvees  during  the first winter  has been examined.  Taking  the 
first cut for silage about May 20 ensures  high quality  material  for the 
calves provided  preservation  is good. The performance  of spring born 
sucklers  fed high quality  silage and approximately  6 lb meals daily is 
shown  in Table  7.

Although  performance  was good,  final carcase  weights  at approximately  
14 months  of age are low. The possibility  of increasing  carcase  weight 
by grazing  for a couple  of months  in spring  before  slaughter  was studied  
for three years and the average  results  are shown  in Table 8.

The performance  at pasture  of animals  fed on a high plane of nutrition  
from birth to 14 months  was poor. Therefore,  the alternatives  are either  
to provide  a high plane of nutrition  in winter and slaughter  at the 
end of winter  or to feed silage and only a small quantity  of meals in 
winter  and finish at a later date.
Problems
(u) Scour in calves
This is undoubtedly  the greatest  problem  with herds calving  indoors.  
The only satisfactory  solution  found at Grange  is to calve each cow in 
a thoroughly  clean calving  box The cow and calf remain  in the box 
for 3-4 days after which the cows are fed in a wood and the calves 
have access  to pasture.  The following  management  factors  help to reduce  
the incidence  of scours :
1.
2. 
T
4.
5.Ensure  the calf suckles  within the first six hours of life.
Avoid mixing  calves of different  ages.
Avoid mixing  cows from different  herds at calving.
Isolate  all purchased  calves and do not mix with the remainder  
of the herd until at pasture.
The incidence  of scours  is far less when calving  occurs  at pasture  
and if possible,  aim to keep the calf outdoors  for about the first 
three weeks  of life.
ib) Hyponia^nesaeinia  in cows
Grass tetany problems  in our spring  calving  herd arise mainly  during  
the first 4-6 weeks at pasture  in spring. Dusting  the pasture  at this 
period  with about 28 lb calcined  magnesite  per acre before  grazing  each 
paddock  deals effectively  with the problem.
Economic  assessment  of suckling  systems
To evaluate  suckling  economically,  four spring calving  systems  are 
taken in which the calves  are disposed  of at different  ages as follows  : 
(1) in autumn  at 8-9 months;  (2) in spring as stores at 14 months;  (3)
23
as fat animals  in spring  at 14-15 months;  (4) heifers  fat at 19 months  of 
age and bullocks  at 25 months.  To form a basis of comparison,  a fifth 
system  which involves  taking  a spring born Friesian  bull calf from the 
dairy herd from birth to slaughter  is included.
A summary  of the five systems  is shown in Table 9 which includes 
weight  at sale and selling  price. As the selling  prices represent  relative  
cattle prices taken over a number  of years,  the relative  returns  from the 
systems  do not necessarily  apply to any particular  year but represent  
the average  expected  over a number  of years assuming  similar  fluctua ­
tions take place in the future as occurred  in the past. In these

Rural Economy  Section,  which shows the relative  selling  prices for ani­
mals of different  weights  and sex throughout  the year. The only exception 
was System  3 where light animals  are sold fat and therefore,  fat cattle 
prices are used rather than the price of animals  of this weight  in April  
which is higher.
calculations,  the growth of bullocks  from the suckling  systems  are 
assumed  to be the same as the Friesians  in System  5 when feeding  levels
24
were similar,  as are selling  prices. It is also assumed  that the animals  can 
reach these target weights  without  becoming  excessively  fat and any 
other advantages  (extra  growth  and higher  selling  prices)  from using  con­
tinental  type bulls are discussed  later.
The costs and returns  per acre from the five systems  are shown in 
Table 10. Calves  from the dairy herd (Friesian  bulls) are charged  at 
£55 per head, based on the average  price of all calves  over the last eight  
years being about twice the value per cwt of a fat animal in spring. 
The gross margin per acre is only £53 where weanlings  are sold in 
autumn,  £77 where  stores  are sold as yearlings  and over £80 for systems 
where the animals  are taken to slaughter.  When overhead  costs are 
deducted,  the figures  obtained  (net margins)  follow  a similar  trend. Net 
margins  represent  the actual return per acre which the farmer  obtains,  
assuming  no capital is borrowed.  Assuming  that all capital  has to be 
borrowed  for livestock,  buildings,  etc., and that interest  is charged  at 
12%, then the figures for net margin  less interest  on working  capital  
apply. Because  of the large differences  in the number  of stock carried  
and the duration  they are on the farm, this figure provides  the most 
valid comparison  of the five systems. In practice,  a varying  proportion  
of the buildings  and livestock  would be already  available  but some 
borrowing  would  be necessary,  the amount  being  greater  for some systems 
than others.

slurry
Interest  on working  capital  amounts  to about  £33 per acre (varies  with 
the system), A large proportion  is interest  charges  on the cows (about  
£18 per acre) which are valued at £150. This figure is large as it is
25
assumed  that the interest  is charged  from the time the cow is purchased  
before  calving  until the calves  are sold. Therefore,  this figure is far too 
high for most situations  and the actual relevant  figure will depend  on 
the circumstances.
Another  major  cost factor  is repayments  plus depreciation  of buildings 
which together amount  to about £14 per acre. On many farms, at 
least a proportion  of these buildings  are available  thereby  reducing  this 
cost factor. The major building  charge is for the cows. Some farms 
may have rocky outcrops,  woods or scrub land for outdoor  wintering  
of cows, and the build-up  of disease  which occurs indoors  is avoided  
with a resultant  decline  of calf scours.
The stocking  rates used for all systems  were high, but adequate  to 
ensure sufficient  feed if properly  managed.  Grass grazed in situ is a 
cheap  feed and in beef production  it is essential  not to stock so heavily 
that the performance  of animals  is restricted  to less than 95% of potential  
growth  during  the grazing  season.
Other factors  affecting  returns
Calf mortality  is taken at 6% in the systems  outlined  and if this is 
increased  to 12% returns  would  be reduced  by about £3 per acre. This 
varies  somewhat  between  systems  and assumes  that the calf dies in early 
life and can be replaced.
Relative  to Hereford  bulls, carcase  weight increase  of 8% or 50 lb 
can be expected  by using the better late maturing  breeds. At 44p per 
lb carcase  this increases  sale value per animal  by £22.
Increasing  carcase  price by 2p per lb increases  returns by £12 per 
animal (600 lb carcase). If a higher price were paid for the leaner  
carcases,  this would be a tremendous  incentive  for producers  to breed 
these animals.
Bulls can be expected  to gain about 10% faster than bullocks,  are 
more efficient  converters  of feed and produce  leaner  carcases.  Therefore,  
the general  advantages  discussed  in relation  to the faster  growing  breeds 
(carcase  weight  and carcase  value)  also apply to bulls with the exception  
that, in a suckler  herd, half the progeny  will be heifers.
In System  5. calves were charged  at twice the price per cwt of beef 
in spring  or £55 per head. If calves  were purchased  at £42 or 1 \ times 
the price per cwt beef, then net margin  per acre less interest  on working  
capital would increase  from £35 to £51 per acre. This demonstrates  
the tremendous  effect of calf prices on returns  from this system.
In conclusion,  in the absence  of reasonable  alternatives  single suckling 
can give satisfactory  returns. However,  use of Continental  type bull 
breeds  on mature  cows and taking  the progeny  to slaughter  are strongly 
advised. It is essential  that cattle numbers  be maintained  or increased  
(otherwise  calf prices will become  excessive)  and it may be necessary 
to increase  the payments  per cow in the Beef Incentive  Scheme  to keep 
pace with inflation.

The Economic  Implications  of Breed  
Differences  in Commercial  Beef  
Production  Systems
by
J. B. KILKENNY,
Meuf & Livestock  Comniission,  Great  Britain.
The overall  objective  of efficient  commercial  beef production  is to produce 
carcases  of the weight,  shape and saleable  beef yield demanded  by the 
market,by  the most profitable  production  systems.To  the extent  that there  
is a range of profitable  systems,  flexibility  in the operation  of a single  
system  and continuous  development  of systems  of production,  there is 
scope for selecting  breeds  and crosses  which best meet the overall  objec ­
tive. The complication  in the designation  of the ‘best breeds  is equating  
the various,  often antagonistic,  requirements  of different  sectors  of the 
industry. For the calf producer  ease of calving  and calf mortality  have 
considerable  importance.  In countries  such as Britain  where consider ­
able reliance  is placed  on beef from the dairy herd these considerations  
are particularly  highlighted  and often represent  a clear conflict  between 
the calf supplier  and the beef producer. The rearer and finisher  are 
concerned  with growth,  slaughter  weight,  and in beef systems  using ex­
pensive  diets, feed efficiency.  In Britain  there is a close relationship  
between  the beef and dairy sectors,  as well as providing  calves for beef 
production  the dairy herd is also a major  source  of supply  of replacement  
beef cross cows for the beef herd. Here there is a potential  conflict 
between  the requirement  for high growth  rate progeny  and replacement  
cow size. The meat trade seeks carcases  with a high yield of saleable  
beef, much of it distributed  in the high price cuts. These  examples  give 
an indication  of the conflicting  difficulties  involved  in creating  a produc ­
tion and marketing  chain which recognises  these separate  requirements.
There is a wide range of sire breeds  available  to the individual  beef 
producer  in Britain. Breeds  of sire differ in lateness  of maturity  (i.e. the 
weight at which they achieve  a given level of fatness or finish) and 
mature  size. In commercial  practice  the former  is of high economic  
importance  along with an indirect  character  associated  with mature  size 
—growth  rate. Mature  size is only of consequence  per se in relation  
to cow size in the beef herd. Both lateness  of maturity  and growth  rate 
affect the third economically  important  character  — feed conversion  
efficiency.
In combination  with this range of breed types there is a spectrum  of 
economically  viable beef production  systems  with markedly  different
28
slaughter  weights  and ages. At one extreme  cattle fed all-concentrate  
diets are slaughtered  at less than a year of age to produce  lightweight  car­
cases. At the other  extreme  cattle are fed low levels  of concentrates  and 
are grass finished  at over 2 years of age producing  heavyweight  carcases.  
To optimise  resource  use it is important  to select the breed or cross for 
the beef sy.stem in which its characteristics  are best utilised  i.e. ‘horses 
for courses'.
Performance  results —growth  rate and slaughter  weights
Most of the available  information  on the comparative  growth and 
slaughter  weights  of breeds  and crosses  has been derived  from commer ­
cial beef units recorded  by the Meat & Livestock  Commission.  Daily  
gains and slaughter  weights  given as percentage  deviations  from con­
temporary  Friesian  steers are shown in Table 1 for two systems  of pro­
duction-  -cereal  beef and 18-month  beef. The large late maturing  breeds 
led by the Charolais  and closely  followed  by the Simmental  and South 
Devon  produced  the highest  gains and slaughter  weights. The perform ­
ance of the Hereford  x Friesian  is an exception  to the general  rule in 
that its growth  rate is higher  than would  be predicted  from a consideration  
of the performance  of its pure-bred  parents. Despite  a higher average  
growth  rate compared  to the Friesian  it has a lower  commercial  slaughter  
weight i.e., it is earlier  maturing.  Breeds  of sire rank the same on both 
the cereal beef and 18 month beef systems.

Table ^ shows similar  information  on the weaning  weight  of suckled 
calves in beef herds. The ranking  of sire breeds is the same as in 
Table 1 and although  the absolute  weights  decline  from the low and 
to the hill environment,  reflecting  nutritional  differences,  the ranking  
within  each environment  is consistent.

Contemporary  comparison  with Hereford  crosses

The sire breed rankings  of crossbred  calf performance  closely  follow 
a ranking  based on purebred  weight  for age (Table  4). Also shown in 
this table is an indication  of the variation  in individual  performance  
whch exists within all breeds. Obviously  sampling  techniques  are an 
important  factor in obtaining  reliable  breed comparison  figures  and the 
individual  farmer  must be aware of individual  performance  when pur­

Performance  results —calf birthweights  and calving  difficulties
The major problem  with the use of heavier  breeds  to increase  growth  
rate and slaughter  weight  is that they inevitably  sire calves with higher  
birthweights,  which is a major factor involved  in difficulties  of calving  
and perinatal  calf mortality.  Table 5 summarises  the effect of sire 
breeds on calf birthweights  in suckler  herds, it is interesting  to note 
that calves born in lowland  herds weighed  nearly 10 lb more on average  
than calves born in hill herds.
The effects  of using larger  breeds  of sire on dystokia  and calf mortality  
are well documented  on dairy cows in Britain  (Table  6).
These  figures  clearly  show that the larger breeds  of sire are associated  
with higher  levels of difficult  calvings  and calf deaths  than the smaller  
breeds,  and that the differences  are most dramatic  with heifer matings. 
Results  from the US Meat Animal Re,search  Centre (Laster,  Glimp,  
Cundiff  and Gregory  1973) clearly  indicate  the larger breeds  should  not 
be used for heifer matings  (Table  7).
There are only limited  data available  on calving  difficulties  and calf 
mortality  levels in beef herds in Britain. Table 8 summarises  informa ­
tion on calving  performance  in recorded  suckler  herds by breed of sire. 
The data on sire breeds are confounded  with herd differences  so that 
they cannot  be used for precise  breed comparisons.  However,  the breeds  
follow a similar pattern to the results in Tables 6 and 7 although

the differences  between  breeds in calf mortality  tend to be lower. To 
obtain more precise  information  the MLC started a calving  survey in 
beef herds in the autumn  of 1974. The preliminary  results from this 
survey  confirm  the relationship  between  birthweight,  calf mortality  and 
difficuly  of calving. Calves born dead were on average  9.1 lb heavier  
than live born calves. Calves  born at assisted  calvings  weighed  7.8 lb 
more than calves born at unassisted  calvings.
There are considerable  differences  in calving  characteristics  between 
bulls within a breed, and so monitoring  individual  bulls in AI studs 
is essential.  It is also important  that calf mortality  and difficult  calvings 
are put into context;  it is inevitable  that the use of larger breeds will 
result in more difficult  calving  and dead calves  even if the worst indivi-

dual bulls within a breed are selected  against. Table 9 shows the 
number  of calves  per 100 cows required  to produce  the same total wean ­
ing weight as 100 Hereford  cross calves. For example  93 Charolais  
cross calves  will produce  the same total weaning  weight  as 100 Hereford  
cross calves or 107 Angus calves. These differences  do not represent  
the full story, for example  they do not take into account  the additional  
costs of supervision  at calving,  the extra stress on the cow, etc., neverthe ­
less, the differences  are appreciably  higher than the differences  in calf 
mortality  levels in both Table 6 (cow figures)  and Table 8. Thus it 
could be more profitable  to use a larger breed of sire resulting  in a 
lower number  of calves reared than a smaller  breed with a greater  
number  of calves produced.

‘ Horses  for courses  ’
The results presented  earlier show no evidence  of an interaction  
between  breed and system sufficient  to change  the order of ranking  of 
breeds  and crosses  on the basis of growth  rates and slaughter  weights.  
The ranking  was consistent  whether  considering  the pure-bred  perform ­
ance, cross-bred  performance  in different  beef production  systems,  in 
different  environments  and Table 10 extends  this to look at the perfor ­
mance  out of contrasting  dairy cows.

Despite  this consistency  there is still room for a ‘horses  for courses ’ 
argument  in terms of the overall  suitability  of a cross for a system  of 
beef production  on the grounds  of complementarity.  The aspect of 
cattle performance  with the greatest  impact  on the way in which breeds 
and crosses  fit into beef production  systems  is earliness  of maturity.  
Size is often, but not always,  related to earliness  of maturity —small  
breeds such as Angus are earlier maturing;  large breeds such as the 
Charolais  are late maturing. These breeds represent  the extremes  in 
size and degree  of maturity  in commercially  available  cattle but between 
these there is a whole  spectrum  of combinations  of size and maturity.
Early maturity  can be exploited  in two ways. Either  the cattle can 
be finished  earlier  but lighter  on the same diets as late maturing  types
34
or they can be finished  on lower concentrate —higher  forage diets than 
later maturing  types and still produce  carcases  of acceptable  market  
finish. By contrast  late maturing  cattle are lean and can be fed high 
energy  cereal  diets, they grow fast to a rellatively  high slaughter  weight;  
they are inclined  to produce  slaughter  weights  too high for many  market  
outlets in high forage systems. These characteristics  are summarised  
overleaf.

On farms the tendency  is to reduce  the potential  differences  between  
breeds  by slaughtering  early maturing  Angus  and Hereford  crosses  at a 
higher  level of carcase  fat cover  than later maturing  Friesian  and Charo ­
lais crosses. The carcases  are then used by different  sectors  of the meat  
trade. These differences  are illustrated  graphically  in Figure 1 which 
shows  a curve  relating  slaughter  weight  and slaughter  age for the Friesian  
and main beef breed Friesian  crosses. The figures  below  the curve are 
the typical carcase  classifications  (on the MLC scheme)  achieved  by 
cattle for the three major identified  systems  of production.  It can be 
clearly  seen that within the broad description  of a single system that 
there is a wide range of slaughter  ages and weights  depending  upon the 
type of cattle and precise  way in which  they are managed  on the indivi ­
dual farm. In fact there is a continuous  range of slaughter  age/weight  
combinations  within  which  adjacent  systems  of production  overlap. The 
information  on carcase  classification  shows  a tendency  for both the fat­
ness and conformation  scores to increase  as cattle are slaughtered  at 
older ages and heavier  weights. At each point slaughter  at a lower 
level of fat cover would  reduce  the slaughter  weight.
For a full evaluation  of the total fitness of a breed or cross for a 
system  of production  additional  information  on feed efficiency  and car­
case characteristics  is required.  Such information  is now being collected  
in two MLC beef units established  specifically  for this purpose. At one 
unit the finishing  performance  of suckled  calves is being evaluated  in 
two common  systems —the winter finishing  of autumn-born  calves at 
about 18 months  of age and the overwintering  of spring-bom  calves 
followed  by summer  finishing. At the other unit the performance  of 
dairy-bred  calves  is being  evaluated  again under  two systems  of manage ­
ment — a semi-intensive  system with the final finishing  period in the 
second  winter  of life and two-year  system  with summer  finishing. At 
both units the cattle are fed diets based on dried grass to reproduce
35
commercial  growth rates and for the period of six months before 
slaughter,  individual  feed intakes  are recorded  using electronically  con­
trolled  feeding  gates. The cattle are slaughtered  at constant  finish deter ­
mined  by ultrasonic  scanning.  The carcase  cutting  test involves  jointing  
the side by a standard  method,  deboning  and trimming  excess  fat. This 
then measures  the yield of saleable  meat.

It will be some time before full results are available  but results for 
cattle finished  in the summer  of 1974 at the suckled  beef unit (Ingliston)  
illustrates  some of the considerations  involved  in an evaluation  of over­
all fitness (Table 11). Since each sire breed is represented  by only 12 
steers  per intake,  results  for a single  finishing  group  cannot  be sufficiently  
precise  for an accurate  evaluation,  so care must be exercised  in drawing  
firm conclusions  from the present set of results However,  the pro­
gramme  will be repeated  year by year so that accurate  results can be
36
used for more precise  evaluation  later. Table 11 shows that there are 
important  differences  between sire breed groups in slaughter  age, 
slaughter  weights  and daily gains. As in the data from commercial  beef 
units, early maturing  types such as Aberdeen  Angus crosses were  
slaughtered  at a much lower slaughter  weight  than late maturing  Charo ­
lais crosses. There were especially  large differences  in total feed intake,  
late maturing  groups  such as Charolais,  Simmental  and South Devon  
crosses  consuming  nearly  twice as much feed during  the finishing  period  
as early maturing  Angus  crosses. At the same time these late maturing  
groups  were amongst  those with the lowest feed conversion  efficiency.  
The variadon  in saleable  beef percentage,  the most important  carcase  
measure,  is relatively  small, but even a one percent  change  has com­
mercial  significance.
Choice  of breed affects  working  capital  needs,  total feed requirements  
and efficiency  of feed use. This illustrates  the complexity  of designating  
the best breeds. With only a small number  of cattle of each cross 
slaughtered  for each of the beef systems  so far, it is too soon to attempt  
a complete  economic  evaluation  of the results. However,  in conjunction  
with the large amount  of performance  data from farms,  they provide  the 
input/output  values for the performance  balance  sheet. The informa ­
tion is vital to the beef producer  seeking  to fit a breed or cross into his 
beef system  with reference  to the feed resources  and buildings  available  
and cash flow requirements.
For the information  to be useful it must be presented  in a simple  and 
effective  way. It is intended  to combine  the date with economic  values 
to calculate  relative  calf values  for different  situations  to give the same 
level of profitability.
Some attempts  have already  been made at this type of evaluation  
using farm data; the information  collected  at the breed evaluation  units  
will considerably  improve  the precision  to such calculations.  Table 12 
shows  how farmers  treat different  breeds  and crosses  differently  in com­
mercial  practice. The figures  in the table are average  performance  levels  
and concentrate  inputs  for three breed types in three systems  of produc ­
tion from recorded  farms. For the 18-month  and 24-month  beef systems 
the effect on stocking  rates have been estimated  from farm records.
In cereal beef units Charolais  Friesians  are slaughtered  60 lb heavier  
than Friesians  at about the same age and with a similar  overall  input  
of concentrates  they have better feed conversion.  Hereford  x Friesians  
were slaughtered  at weights  40 lb less than Friesians,  and take 23 days 
less to slaughter,  conversion  of concentrates  is poorer  than the Friesian.  
In grass/cereal  18-month  beef units the Hereford  x Friesian  is slaughtered  
at appreciably  lower weights  than the Friesian  (110 lb liveweight  differ ­
ence). Its overall  growth  rate is similar  to the Friesian  and hence the 
production  cycle is 48 days shorter  on average. Because  they are early  
maturing,  farmers  feed them less concentrates  in the finishing  winter  
and the overall  conversion  of concentrates  per lb of gain is lower than 
for the Friesian  and Charolais  x Friesian.
In grass 24-month  beef the overall  concentrate  usage is more similar  
between  the three breed types, a reflection  of the finishing  stage being

at grass rather  than in yards. However,  in this situation  the Hereford  x 
Friesian  is finishing  on average  80 days quicker  than the Friesians.
It must be stressed  that these data are based on farm results  and are 
therefore  strongly  influenced  by the management  that farmers  apply to 
the different  breeds,  they are in no way breed comparisons  under  a stan­
dard management  system. Nevertheless  they reflect how producers  can 
and do adopt  management  to allow for differences  in the characteristics  
of the crosses  they are using. The main adaptation  is in concentrate  
usage and this reduces  the impact  of additional  silage requirements  and 
stocking  rates and the length of the production  cycle. If concentrate  
levels were not adjusted  breed differences  would reflect themselves  in 
greater  differences  in overall stocking  rates and the differences  in the 
number  of days to reach a given level of finish would  be increased.  The 
figures  clearly  reflect that beef producers  who run mixed breed batches  
of cattle cannot  apply  optimum  management  and feeding  to take account  
of the appreciable  differences  between  crosses.
Killing-out  percentage

carcases  of better  shape,  but not necessarily  higher  fatness,  kill out better.  
Thus the ‘Continental ’ beef breeds generally  kill out better than the 
British  breeds  at the same level of fatness. This is illustrated  in Table 13 
which summarises  data on killing  out percentages  in trials co-ordinated  
by the Limousin  and Simmental  Steering  Committee.  The Limousin  
crosses  are particularly  striking  in this respect.
Economically  important  carcase  characteristics
Carcase  characteristics  are only important  to the producer  if they are 
are reflected  in economic  terms. With the present  marketing  system  in 
Britain  differences  in the value of carcases  due to quality  variations  are 
difficult  to detect against  the general  background  of variations  in price 
due to supply  and demand. The beef producer  knows that he must  
generally  avoid excessive  fatness  and ‘under-finished ’ cattle but beyond

this he receives  no clear direction  from the market  on the type that will 
be most beneficial  for him to produce. Producers  require  positive  feed­
back from the market  about what to produce  and the relative  value of 
different  types. A carcase  classification  scheme  is central to changing  
the position  so that the industry  can attach higher  values  to better than 
average carcases  and can discount  more clearly those poorer than 
average. The method of carcase classification  developed  in Britain  
(MLC 1975 a) is now applied  to 45 percent  of all cattle slaughtered  and 
involves  a visual judgment  of fat class and of conformation  classes in 
addition  to weight  and sex. Yield of saleable  beef is the most important  
overall assessment  of a carcase. It is very variable  but particularly  
determined  by the extent  of carcase  fatness  and the ratio of lean to bone.  
The amount  of fat trim is the primary  determinant  of value; weight 
coupled  with fat classes  explains  over half of the variation  in the yield  
of saleable  meat.
Conformation,  in addition  to fatness,  is important  in a carcase  classi ­
fication  system however,  because  there are important  shape related  
differences  in meat yield between  breeds  (differences  within  breed types 
are small and not important)  especially  between  dairy breeds and the 
more muscular  Continental  beef breeds (Table 14). Breed is a vital 
factor in the conformation/lean  meat yield relationship.  For example  
Table 14 shows  that among  carcases  classified  2.3 the average  lean con- 
ent varied  from 62% for Friesian  x Ayrshire  steers  to 67% for Limousin  
x Friesian  steers.
If the market  expresses  a preference  for better conformation  at low 
levels of fatness  (a classification  scheme  is essential  if such preferences 
are to be expressed),  this should  have the effect  of encouraging  the adapta ­
tion of breeds in commercial  production  with a high yield of saleable  
meat and therefore  an economic  advantage.
There has been a reluctance  in Britain  to accept  carcases  at low levels  
of finish, despite  the production  desirability  of this, because  generally 
these are associated  with poor conformation  in British breeds under  
British  conditions.  Carcases  of low levels of fatness are much more 
acceptable  to the meat trade when they are of good conformation  even 
though  there may not be a much higher  yield of saleable  meat. Addi-

tionally  there is a relationship  between  conformation  and thickness  of 
the lean meat (as apposed  to its yield) amongst  crosses  of similar  weight 
and fatness.
Although  the demands  of the retail trade are variable  and to some 
extent,  flexible,  there is a doubt that the average  beef carcase  can be 
improved  with substantial  benefits  to the efficiency  of beef production.  
On a long term basis a realistic  efficiency  target is to move the average  
British  beef carcase  from 3 3 towards  2 4 (i.e. leaner,  but with improved  
conformation)  with some increase  in carcase  weight  and with improved  
feed conversion.  The scale of the advantage  in carcase  terms that might  
be achieved  by such a change  is shown  in Table 15. The MLC  Marketing  
Department  have introduced  the concept  of ‘Target  Beef (MLC 1975 b) 
in an attempt  to improve  the efficiency  of the meat trade by getting  it 
to modify  its buying practices  and to link price positively  with clear  
grades  defined  in classification  terms. The simple  concept  of target  beef 
clarifies  the improvement  objectives  to the producers  and encourages  
the emergence  of clear incentives  for them, to move  towards  the improved  
type.
Target  beef classes  are shown  in Figure  2. As far as breed compari ­
sons are concerned  what is important  is the proportion  of carcases  falling 
into these target groups. Nationally  about a third (the top third) of 
carcases  are wihin this group but there are emerging  large breed differ ­
ences.  for example  in recent  trials, 83 and 90 percent  have been achieved  
by different  groups  of Limousin  crosses. The best way of improving  
conformation  quickly  is by giving  preference  to Continental  breeds  which 
will also bring about the desired  improvements  in the yield of saleable  
beef.
The appearance  and eating  characteristics  of beef are affected  as much 
by the treatment  of the animal  before slaughter  as by the handling  of 
the carcase  after slaughter.  Providing  beef is young (as the bulk of it 
will be under modern  production  systems)  then any differences  between

breed types which have been determined  have been small and cannot  
be considered  important  in relation  to the wide range acceptable  to the 
consumer  and the wide range of variation  found in commercial  beef due 
mainly  to age and handling  techiques.
Currently  beef cattle in Britain are either Friesians,  British breed 
crosses  or Continental  breed crosses. It is inevitable,  in view of the 
structure  of the beef industry  that the purebred  Friesian  steer will con­
tinue to make an important  contribution.  The Friesian  currently  pro­
duces typically  a 2 2 carcase  with only a small proportion  of carcases  
attaining  2 3 and therefore  falling into the target group. Few could

be expected  to achieve  a 2 4 classification.  A recent disturbing  feature  
of the Friesian  breed is the increasing  proportion  of Canadian  Holstein  
blood being incorporated  into the breed which will inevitably  make it 
more difficult  to achieve  improved  conformation  and saleable  meat yield  
at the target  fatness  level. The most commonly  used beef breed of bull 
in Britain  is the Hereford.  With the Hereford  x Friesian  conformation  
class 4 is usually  achieved  at fat class 3 but it is more difficult  to achieve  
2 4 although  there is extensive  variation  within  the breed. In commer ­
cial production  the Hereford  cross at fat class 2 is frequently  too light 
for market  demand. The situation  is even wor.se with the most early  
maturing  breeds  such as the Angus. Angus  crosses  are not often suit­
able for the mass market  but meet the demands  of the quality beef 
market  where higher levels of finish are desired  in young light weight 
animals. Such crosses  are of course  more expensive  to produce.
In cereal  and grass/cereal  systems  quick  growing,  late maturing  breeds  
of good muscular  conformation  imported  from Continental  Europe  can 
produce  crosses  with the Friesian  or smaller  cows  which  are muscular and 
lightly covered with external  fat. Charolais  and Limousin  crosses  
readily  attain a 2 4 classification  although  on limited  evidence  the Sim­
mental seems to be a rather more variable  breed providing  a higher

Breed Comparisons  in Single
Suckling  Herds
by
E. G. MOORE.
Department  of Agriculture  and Fisheries,  Dublin.
Of the national  herd of two million  cows, approximately  one-third  are 
beef cows, mostly  in single  suckling  herds. Little detailed  information  is 
available  concerning  animal  performance  in these herds. Surveys  were 
conducted  in 1973 and in 1975 in order to obtain  data on the effects  of 
sire and dam in suckling  herds.
Methods
Mainly  spring  calving  single suckling  herds were selected  with the aid 
of County Advisory  personnel,  A.I. stations.  Beef Incentive  Bonus  
Scheme  offices and co-operating  farmers.  While the majority  of herds  
encountered  were predominately  single  suckling,  some herds with double  
and multiple  suckled  calves  were recorded.  In 1973 the survey  covered 
the following  counties:  Meath,  Westmeath,  Offaly,  Galway,  Mayo and 
Roscommon.  In 1975 the survey  was concentrated  in the Western  area 
and covered  Donegal,  Sligo, Mayo,  Roscommon,  Galway  and Offaly  and 
only herds using at least two breeds  of sire were selected.  Calves  were  
weighed  on two occasions  in 1973, July and September-October,  and 
once in 1975, September-October.
The results  were analysed  by the method  of least squares  on a within  
herd basis. This means  that information  on the relative  merits  of breeds  
was obtained  only in herds with at least two different  breeds. The model  
included  effects for sire breed, dam breed, lactation  number,  month  of 
calving,  sex, method  of suckling,  days of age and a sire breed by dam 
breed interaction.  Close examination  of the 1975 data led to some 
changes  in the model,  mainly  the inclusion  of a sire breed by dam breed  
interaction.
Results
Table I summarises  the scope of the survey.
The proportion  of Charolais  and Simmental  increased  from 12% in 
1973 to 36% in 1975. A probable  reason  for this may be that the 1975 
survey was conducted  mainly  in the western  region,  serviced  by Sligo  
A.I. station  and which has a high usage of continental  type bulls. Here ­
ford usage dropped  from 55% to 30% while the remaining  breeds re­
mained  more or less static.

Sire breed had a significant  effect on the weight  of calves  in both years. 
In 1973 Charolais  and Simmental  crosses  were 10% and 7% better  than 
Hereford  crosses. Friesian  and Hereford  crosses were similar,  while  
Aberdeen  Angus  and Shorthorn  were somewhat  lighter. In 1975 Char-

Breed of dam was a significant  source  of variation  in 1973 but not in 
1975. However,  if the unrecorded  group in 1973 is ignored  then breed 
differences  are small. In both years, Friesian  type, Hereford  x Friesian  
and Charolais  type dams had slightly  heavier  calves,  2-3%,  than progeny 
of Hereford  cross, Aberdeen  Angus  or Shorthorn  cross dams.
Lactation  number  of dam
Table 7 shows the effect of lactation  number  on the weight  of calves.

Lactation  number  had a significant  effect on calf weights  in both 
years. As the lactation  number  increased,  weight  of calves  also increased 
except  in 1975 when 2nd lactation  cows had slightly  heavier  progeny  at 
six months  than 3rd lactation  cows. There  was no evident  reason  for this 
effect. Progeny  of 1st lactation  cows were 36 lb. and 47 lb. lighter  than 
those of 4th and later lactation  cows. It is likely that lighter  calf birth  
weights  and lower milk yields of 1st lactation  cows was the reason  for 
this effect.
While the model included  effects  for month of calving  and age, both 
of these were confounded  in the data and it was not possible  to .separate  
either effect clearly.
Sex of calf
The effect of sex of calf is shown  in Table 8.

Type of sex was a significant  source  of variation  in both years. Males  
were heavier  than females  by 24 lb. and 32 lb. in 1973 and 1975 respec ­
tively.
Method  of suckling
As stated previously  the survey dealt mainly with single suckling 
herds. However,  other methods  of suckling  were practised  and these  
effects  were included  in the model  (Table  9).

The effect of suckling  method  was a significant  source  of variation  in 
in 1973 and 1975. Double  suckled  and multiple  suckled  calves were  
lighter by 25 lb. and 52 lb. in 1973 and by 27 lb. and 81 lb. in 1975 
respectively.
Sire breed  x dam interaction
Sire breed x dam breed interaction  was not a significant  source of 
variation  in 1975. This effect was not included  in the 1973 analysis  
because  of missing  or small subclasses.
Discussion
The mean calving  dates in the two years 1973 and 1975 were similar,  
April 5th and April 7th respectively.  Hence,  calves were almost six 
months  of age at weighing  and weighed  425 lb. and 446 lb.— Table 1. 
If a mean birthweight  of 80 lb. is assumed,  the average  daily gain is 1.93 
lb./day  and 2.08 Ib./day  for 1973 and 1975 respectively.  Whilst  this rate 
of gain appears  satisfactory,  average  weaning  weight  is much too low. 
Research  by the Agricultural  Institute  at Grange  has shown  that average 
weaning  weights  can be as high as 550 lb. This can be achieved  by 
earlier  calving  and by use of fast growing  bulls. The mean calving  date 
in this survey  is at least one month  too late and should  be brought  for­
ward to early March. This could be achieved  at very little extra cost 
and improve  weaning  weights  by up to 60 lb.
The survey  showed  that the use of faster growing  bulls can improve 
calf performance  on average  by 30-55 Ib. Charolais  and Simmental  
crosses were from 7-10% heavier  than those of Hereford  crosses at
weighing  in nutumn.  This result is similar  to that obtained  by the Meat 
and Livestock  Commission  in Great Britain,  where Charolais  and Sim­
mental crosses have consistenly  outranked  all other breed crosses in 
terms of performance.
Crosses  which impart  higher  growth  rates also tend to have greater  
incidence  of calving  difficulties  largely because  of greater calf birth-  
weights.  No attempt  was made  to assess  calving  difficulties  in this survey.  
However,  it is agreed  that continental  type bulls should  not be used on 
heifers  and any bull with a history  of difficult  calvings  should not be 
used on either  cows or heifers. Such a bull can be identified  on the basis 
of records  and withdrawn  from service. Data on ease of calving  would 
allow further  exploitation  of the growth potential  of continental  type 
bulls.
Calf performance  was somewhat  higher  in 1975 than in 1973, probably  
because  of the higher  proportion  of Charolais  and Simmental  crosses  in 
1975. There were smaller  differences  among dam breeds than among  
sire breeds. Nevertheless,  the progeny  of Friesian  cross, Hereford  Frie­
sian cross and Charolais  cross cows tended  to give heavier  calves  due to 
extra milk or more growthiness.
Progeny  of heifers  were lighter  than those of second  and subsequent  
lactation  cows at weighing  time and this is in agreement  with MLC  
results  in Great Britain. Similarly  male calves  were heavier  than female 
calves.
Single suckled  calves were heavier  than double  and multiple  suckled 
calves in both years. The weight  difference  ranged  from i to | cwt. over 
and above double and multiple  suckled  calves respectively.  This dif­
ference  must be borne in mind when considering  which type of suckling 
is more profitable.  For intensified  beef production,  light weanlings  pre­
sent a problem.  Where  the aim is the production  of beef at two years of 
age extra meals must be fed to the lighter  weanlings  in order to achieve 
an acceptable  weight  at turnout.

Spring  Milk Production  in Britain
by
J. BUTLER,
L.C.P.  Services,  Milk Marketini;  Board,  England.
There is a high demand  for liquid milk in Britain,  and in 1974/'75  59 
per cent of all milk produced  was sold to the liquid market.  This varied  
from 47 per cent of total production  in May to 70 per cent in November.
Unlike the Republic  of Ireland  there is no distinction  between  pro­
ducers  supplying  the liquid  or the manufacturing  market. All producers  
.sell milk to the Milk Marketing  Board and receive  a similar  average  or 
pool price for their milk regardless  of farm location.
Because  the demand  for liquid milk is fairly constant  and because  the 
variable  costs of producing  summer  milk are less than winter  milk, the 
Board needs to operate  a variable  seasonal  price schedule  to encourage  
winter  milk production.  This price schedule  for the year ending  March  
1976 in pence  per gallon  is shown  in Table 1.

In practice  one result of this seasonal  schedule  is that 75 per cent of 
all herds  calve "all the year round"  and maintain  a level output. Physical  
and financial  results  for average  herds (selected  on a gross margin  per
55
acre basis) calving  all the year round are shown in the first column  of 
Table 2. These  are from a survey  of over 1,500 L.C.P. members  for the 
year ending  March,  1975.

(’> Summer  60% of milk produced  Apr-Sept.
Winter  55% of milk produced  Oct-Mar.
At this level of performance  there is very little in favour  of the winter 
producer  compared  with all the year round  calving  but the summer  pro­
ducer  lags £20 behind  on a gross marging  per acre basis.
Any analysis  of herds on a time of calving  basis is bound to include  
some herds seasonal  calving  by accident  rather than design. This is 
particularly  true when looking  at average  results. Many producers  may 
appear  in a survey as summer  producers  simply because  they are bad 
managers  and the herd calving  index has slipped round to produce  a 
spring  calving  pattern. In order to examine  herds intentionally  calving 
on a seasonal  basis.  Table 3 compares  the top 10 per cent in each calving 
group.
The data show that the winter  producing  herd is superior,  on a gross  
margin  per acre basis,  to the summer  herd by £31. The surprising  feature  
to many specialist  spring  calf producers,  aiming  to maximise  production  
from grass, is the high level of concentrates  used by the spring calving 
group.
These LCP results show (at the gross margin  level of analysis)  that 
a combination  of technical  efficiency  and milk pricing  make  autumn  calv­
ing currently  a more attractive  proposition  in Britain  than spring  calving.
So far we have only considered  technical  efficiency  and gross margin. 
Are higher  margins  reflected  in higher  profits  and a higher  cash surplus?  
In discussing  dairy farming,  the crucial  word m.ust be profit.

based on a full farm survey  of LCP farms in this size bracket  and are 
therefore  representative  of this type and size of farm. At the gross margin  
stage the top 10 per cent man is achieving  an additional  £7,700  over the

charges)  the net profit shov/n  by the top 10 per cent man is £5,420  above

crease  in borrowing.  The top producers  on the other hand have cash left 
for both replacement  of machinery  and expansion.

This brief analysis  shows therefore  that improving  technical  perfor ­

highly  justified.  However,  at all levels of efficiency  overhead  costs and 
commitments  need to be kept in perspective.

The difference  in gross margin  per acre between  average  and top 10 percent  
is £84.
Provided  outgoings  are kept under control  it is obviously  desirable  to 
move from the average  bracket  to the top 10%. Table 7 examines  the 
difference  in physical  and financial  performance  between  the two groups.
The two factors  really influencing  this difference  are yield per cow and 
stocking  rate. The value of a high stocking  rate has been stressed  previ ­
ously and these results  confirm  this view. Unfortunately,  both groups — 
average  and top 10 per cent—will find stocking  rate harder  to increase  in 
the future.
Increased  stocking  rate on the all grass farm can only be achieved  by 
increasing  cow numbers.  Cow prices  are now in excess  of £300 and the 
cost of additional  buildings  is almost  prohibitive.  Table  5 shows  that the 
average  producer  is not generating  a sufficient  cash surplus  to allow for 
expansion.  Increased  borrowings  to buy the marginal  cow always  look 
attractive  on paper but need careful  planning  to avoid the kind of situa ­
tion shown  in Table  6.
The top 10 per cent producer  is already  up to a stocking  rate of 0.9 
acres per cow and recent  experience  in Britain  has persuaded  many far­
59
mers that this is quite high enough  (too high for the drought  of 1975!).  
Higher  stocking  rate will only increase  the need for more bought-in  feed 
etc.
Both groups  of producers  need to focus attention  much more on indi­
vidual  cow performance.
Within  LCP we are conscious  of how easy it has been to increase  total 
farm margin  simply by increasing  stocking  rate. We are now looking 
more closely  at increasing  individual  cow performance.  The remainder  
of this paper describes  briefly three of the new developments  we are 
using at field level.
1. Herd management  control
This scheme was initially  called milk yield predictions.  Knowing  the 
past and current  performance  of an animal,  calving  date and lactation  
number,  it is possible  to accurately  predict  her future yield. If this is 
done for all animals  in the herd, a graph showing  expected  level of herd 
production  can be drawn. If actual  production  is then graphed  against  the 
prediction  any deviation  from expected  yield can be spotted  immediately  
and hopefully  corrective  management  action  taken.
The prediction  is especially  useful in seasonal  calving  herds, where it 
is easy to be lulled into a false sense of security  by increasing  output  in 
the early season. The question  that must always  be asked is: "Is the 
milk yield going up fast enough?"  Similarly  in mid and late lactation  
when the milk yield starts to decline : "Is the milk yield falling  too soon 
and too quickly? ” Figure  1 shows  how Herd Management  Control  allows 
one to spot these deviations  immediately.

Herd management  Control  is linked via Milk Recording  Services  to the 
the Milk Marketing  Board computer  and farmers  using the prediction  
service  are provided  with an up-dated  printout  every two months.
2. Grassland  assessment
In winter  we make every elfort to analyse  quality  of winter  feed and 
measure  the quantity  available.  Subsequent  rationing  starts from this 
logical  basis. At grazing  we work on a very arbitrary  basis and tradition ­
ally, grass is allocated  and valued  according  to months  of growing  and 
almost  totally  regardless  of the quantity  available.
There is little use in imposing  stocking  rate simply  on an area basis.  
We must know the quantity  of grass available  within that area. If we 
know  the quantity  of grass on offer and the requirements  of the stock (for 
both production  and growth)  then we can adjust the stocking  rate to 
match the requirements.  This might,  for example,  mean offering  more 
grass by moving  the fence further  or speeding  up the paddock  rotation  or, 
in a very dry period,  might even mean feeding  supplement.  When  grass  
growth  starts to slow down in August  and September,  it is very easy to 
over-estimate  the quantity  of grass on offer and underfeed.
Asse.s.sing  grass quantity  has been practised  for years in New Zealand  
under the name of paddock  scoring. Whereas  it is obvious  that over 
time a high degree  of skill in paddock  scoring  can be developed  solely by 
walking  the field and visually  assessing  "how much there is”, we in LCP 
felt we needed  to start from a more logical  point. Basically  grass quantity  
is a product  of the height  and density  of grass on offer and currently  we 
are developing  techniques  aimed at measuring  these two factors. The 
grassmeter  described  in a recent edition  of Farmers  Weekh  is one such 
development.
3. Condition  scoring
Correct  rationing  of cows involves  an inter-relationship  between  milk 
yield, feed available  and body reserves.  Various  opinions  have been 
expressed  on cow condition  or ‘‘fitness ”. But what is meant  by condition,  
and more important  what condition  is required  at various  stages of the 
lactation  cycle? It is agreed  that cows should  be fit at calving,  but what  
do we mean by fit, and if cows were fitter, would they produce  more  
milk?
In LCP we are using a technique  pioneered  by the Meat & Livestock  
Commission  on suckler cows called simply “Condition  Scoring ” to 
quantify  and rank cow condition.  The technique  involves  handling  cows  
at three specific  areas- the spinus processes,  the hip bone and the area 
around  the tail head. The condition  score is based on the degree  of fat 
cover  on a scale 0 - 5.
Once a cow has calved  her appetite  is unable  to match  her milk output  
and she is bound  to lose weight  (and condition).  In order  to lose condition  
it must be there to begin with. Many specialist  summer  producers  are 
guilty of running  the herd down in late lactation  and then leaving  the
61
cows on a low plane of nutrition  for the early part of the dry period. 
There  is then insufficient  time available  to replace  body weight  to get the 
cow in optimum  condition  for calving.
The technique  of condition  scoring  can be used to identify  when a herd 
is losing  condition  and at what stage management  action  is needed  to in­
fluence  body condition.  Within  the herd individual  animals  will show  
very different  condition  scores  at any one point in time, and may need to 
be picked  out and grouped  together  for specialist  treatment.
Summary
In Britain  there is a high steady  demand  for liquid milk. In l974/'75  
59 per cent of all milk produced  went into the liquid market. There is 
no distinction  between  liquid and manufacturing  producers.  Seasonality 
of milk production  is influenced  by a variable  monthly  pricing  schedule.
Better  technical  performance  is generally  reflected  in higher  profits  and 
cash available  for replacement  of machinery  and expansion.
There is a big difference  in margin  and profit between  the average  and 
top 10 per cent of summer  milk producers.  Stocking  rate and yield per 
cow account  for the major differences  between  average  and top 10 per 
cent.
In the future,  less reliance  can be placed  on improvement  of stocking  
rate and much more emphasis  must be placed  on increasing  margin  per 
cow.
Herd Management  Control  (milk yield prediction),  grass assessment  
techniques  and condition  scoring  are recent LCP developments  aimed at 
improving  cow performance.

Dairvinj*:  in Holland
by
D. OOSTENDORP.
Research  and Advisory  Institute  for Cattle  Husbandry,  Lelystad,
Holland,
Because  of climatic  and farm structural  circumstances  in Holland  and 
Ireland  I believe  that dairying  will be the most obvious  choice  if not the 
only possibility  for the majority  of farmers.  Therefore  it is interesting  
to study the large differences  in dairy farming  in our two countries.  Table  
1 gives several  data concerning  the structure  of animal  husbandry  in Ire­
land and Holland.

Number  of dairy cows (million) 1.344 2.215
Average  number  of cows per farm 9.7 22.8
Average  milk production  per cow (kg) 2,587 4,490
It is at once obvious  that although  the size of the holdings  is greater  
in Ireland  than in Holland  both the number  of cows per farm and the 
production  per cow are, on average,  notably  greater  in Holland  than in 
Ireland.  Of the total E.E.C.  milk production,  4% is produced  in Ireland  
and 10% in Holland.  Table  2 gives a more  detailed  account  by reproduc ­
ing the percentage  of the dairy herd in the various  sized groups.
The situation  in Ireland  in 1973 is very comparable  with the Dutch  
situation  in 1960. Since 1960 there has been in Holland  a rapidly  growing  
tendency  towards  larger  units for dairy  farming.  This is shown  in Table  3. 
The number  of farms comprising  dairy herds has decreased  strongly  
during  the last 10 years and the total number  of dairy cows has greatly  
increased.
Due to the use of cubicle  houses  with milk chute parlours  it is techni ­
cally possible  to increase  the number  of cows that can be managed  by

all farms planning  to continue  with dairy herds in the future. Table 4 
gives the number  of cubicle  houses  built in Holland  during  the la.st few 
years. At this moment  10,740  of these cubicle  houses  are in use.
The changeover  to larger  units did not, however,  occur simultaneously  
with the enlargement  of farm size. Because  it is almost impossible  to 
buy or rent additional  land, the feed position  of the larger units of dairy  
cattle is protected  by high nitrogen  fertilisation  and a greater  purchase

of concentrates  and roughage  from outside  the farm. This is illustrated  
in Figures  1 and 2 in which are shown  the trends in usage of nitrogen  
fertilizers  and concentrates  for cattle over the last 15 years. In Table 5 
these figures  are expressed  in kg N per ha and kg concentrates  per cow.

cattle (kg/cow  + followers) 800 1,050 1,500
Acreage  of forage  maize (ha) 4,000 6,400 77,500
Forage  maize is mostly  cultivated  by landowners  who will not sell or 
rent their land but will contract  to grow maize  for dairy farmers.  Maize  
cultivation  is a very attractive  enterprise  because  all the work can be 
given out to a contractor.  Also, landowners  with intensive  livestock  
units can get rid of large quantities  of organic  manure  under the maize.
The economic  background  to the strong  increase  in usage of nitrogen  
fertilizers  and concentrates  is that the price relationship  between  milk and 
nitrogen  fertilizers  plus concentrates  has developed  favourably.  In 1960 
the price ratio between  1 kg of nitrogen  and 1 kg of milk was 3.4. This 
decreased  to 2.4 in 1975. The price ratio between  1 kg of concentrates  
and 1 kg of milk decreased  in the same  period  from 1.2 to 0.8. Thus  there  
has been a strong  incentive  to use more nitrogen  and concentrates.  When  
we compare  the costs of 1 kg of starch equivalent  in the different  pro­
ducts, 1 kg of SE in grass costs 4p, in maize  silage  on contract  8p, and in 
concentrates  12p.
It is clear therefore  that with increase  in stocking  rate all the possibili ­
ties of the farm producing  its own feed must be considered.  This means  
firstly a level of nitrogen  fertilisation  that guarantees  a maximum  grass  
output,  combined  with a good utilisation  of the grass, either fresh grass  
or as conserved  product.
Intensive  dairy farming  in Holland  is illustrated  by reference  to the 
technical  and financial  results  of four nitrogen  experimental  farms.  These  
are privately  owned and farm results are being studied  by the Dutch  
Nitrogen  Fertilizer  Industry  Agricultural  Bureau,  the National  Agricul ­
tural Advisory  Service,  the Animal  Health  Service  and the Research  and 
Advisory  Institute  for Cattle  Husbandry.
The four farms  are : a family  farm, a two man farm,  a three man farm  
and a four man farm. In Table  6 the acerage  and stocking  rates of these 
farms are given. Smaller  farms are buying  forage  maize on contract  to 
increase  the amount  of roughage  for the winter period. It is expected  
that this policy  will develop  further  in the near future  and that the forage

forage  maize is concentrated  on the sandy soils in the south and the east 
of Holland  and plays only a minor role in the typical  grassland  districts  
in the north and west of the country.

In Table 7 the milk production  of the four farms is given. Per em­
ployed  labourer,  40 to 50 thousand  gallons  of milk are delivered  to the 
factory. The aim on these farms is to produce  1.300 gallons  with 4% 
fat per cow with 50 to 60 cows per man. The four farms  are progressing  
towards  these targets. About  45% of milk is produced  in the period  from 
November  to May.

usage  onthe four farms shown.
Nitrogen  fertilization  between  300 and 400 lbs. of N per acre per year 
is the maximum  to be applied  according  to Dutch standards.  Only on 
soils which naturally  provide  a certain  amount  of nitrogen  through  min­
eralization,  such as peat soil, is the maximum  level of nitrogen  reached  at 
about  225 lbs. of N per acre per year. Nitrogen  fertilizer  is predominantly  
applied  in the form of 26% calcium  ammonium  nitrate  and 22% mag­
nesium  ammonium  nitrate. There is a growing  trend for the storage  of 
nitrogen  fertilizers  in polyester  silos to improve  labour  efficiency.  Farm

From Figure  I it is clear that in the near future  more nitrogen  fertilizers  
will be used. It is very important  to note that according  to Dutch re­
search  and practical  experience  there is no evidence  for adverse  effects  on 
the health and productivity  of the animals  with high levels of nitrogen  
fertilization.  There is however  a condition  regarding  fertilization  using  
nitrogen,  phosphate  and potassium,  namely  that the limits for maximum  
grass production  are not exceeded  to any great degree. Sufficient  account  
must be taken of the plant nutrients  which are returned  to the soil with 
farmyard  and liquid  manure.  On intensive  grassland  farms  a large amount  
of minerals  are bought  in via the concentrates.  This means  that with an 
increase  in stocking  rate less rather  than more P and K needs to be sup­
plied in the form of fertilizers.  Table 8 shows that no K-fertilizers  and 
only a small quantity  of P-fertilizers  are bought  in.
A high level of nitrogen  fertilization  must be combined  with good uti­
lisation  of the extra herbage. Hence there is a growing  interest  in the 
Neffierlands  in limiting  grazing  losses  by reducing  the duration  of grazing. 
This is achieved  in practice  by allowing  cows to graze during  the daytime  
and housing  them at night. Small quantities  of grass or conserved  feed 
are sometimes  fed indoors  as a supplement  depending  on the quantity  and 
quality  of the available  herbage.  Especially  in spring  and in autumn,  this 
is an effective  way to maintain  good milk production  levels. Also, it offers  
the possibility  in cases of poor lay-out  of the paddocks  to feed fresh grass  
from paddocks  that have no direct access  to the milking  parlour.  Only  
where  land is badly  parcelled  out and where  there is so little land near the 
farm buildings  that access  to pasture  is not possible,  even in the daytime,  
is zero grazing  considered  as a prospect  of farming  in a modern  manner.  
Although  grazing  losses are reduced,  farm results  have shown  that mac­
hinery  costs and expenditure  on concentrates  are much higher  in this sys­
tem than in traditional  grazing  and no direct financial  advantage  results  
from zero grazing.
Another  remarkable  feature  is the amount  of concentrates  fed during  
the summer  period.  Per cow per day, 5.5 to 8.8 lbs. of concentrates  are 
fed. This practice  is very much discussed  and criticised  in the Nether ­
lands because  in grazing  experiments  it was seldom  proved  economical
71
to feed concentrates  to a cow with a production  of 60 lbs. per day and 
less. However,  this discrepancy  between  research  and practice  can per­
haps be explained  by the following  factors  which are affecting  modern  
dairy farms with an increased  number  of cows per acre. The erection  of 
a milking  parlour  with automatic  feeders  on a farm is often the starting  
point of increased  concentrate  usage because :
a. it is easy to feed concentrates;
b. cows  remain  in the milking  parlour;
c. it ensures  a good production  level in periods  of grass shortage  or 
periods  with poor quality  grass;
it reduces  grass intake by 0.6 lb. of dry matter  of grass per lb. of 
concentrates  given. With high stocking  rates extra feed has to be 
bought  in in any case and concentrates  are easy to handle and to 
store with minimum  losses;
the price ratio between  milk and concentrates  has developed  favour ­
ably in the last few years.
Nevertheless,  high use of concentrates  during  the summer  period  should 
be examined  critically.  The difference  between  the four farms in this 
matter  proves  that there is certainly  a possibility  to save on costs by a 
good grazing  policy and a system  of feeding  whereby  the cows that re­
spond  to concentrates  really  consume  them and the cows with lower  pro­
duction  are refused  them.
Conservation  is another  important  aspect  of the utilization  of produced  
herbage.  A conservation  system  with low losses and a finished  product  
with a high feed value and a high voluntary  intake  is of the greatest  im­
portance.  The two largest  farms referred  to above conserve  silage only 
and the two smaller  farms are gradually  changing  over to silage making. 
This demonstrates  the huge development  in the field of roughage  con­
servation  which  have taken  place in the last few years. Table  9 illustrates  
this development.  While  in 1970 only 30% of the roughage  was conservedd.

in the form of silage,  in 1974 it had risen to 54%. This trend is expected  
to continue  in the future. The arrival  of the high dry matter  method,  in 
which  the grass is wilted  in the field to a minimum  of 40% dry matter  has 
given an important  boost to this trend, despite  the fact that, compared
72
a.
e.with direct  cut silage,  the field period  is lengthened,  more field treatments  
must be carried  out and heating  occurs  more  easily  than with a wet silage.  
To explain  this trend, the following  factors  can be considered :
Mechanisation  can be simple. On the average  grassland  farm this 
consists  of a rotary  drum mower,  a tedder  and a pick-up  trailer. A 
chain of machines  needed  for direct cut silage consisting  of a forage  
harvester  and several  trailers  and tractors  would be too large an in­
vestment.
Labour  input in conservation  can be spread  over a long period.  
Aftermath  comes  regularly  available  all through  the grazing  season. 
Conservation  and intake are positively  influenced  by the wilting  of 
the grass.
With the use of tractor  mounted  silage  cutters  the heating  of the silage  
during  the feeding  period  is no longer  a problem  when the silage is 
taken out of the clamp  once a week. Also, labour  involved  in feed­
ing the silage is much reduced.
The important  feature  is that the method  enables  farmers,  under  Dutch  
conditions,  to make a high quality  silage from grass at an early stage of 
growth  with high nitrogen  fertilization.  Farmers  can take full advantage  
of a maximum  of home produced  feedstuffs  also during  the winter.
Finally,  let us consider  the financial  results  of the four farms. They are 
based on Dutch prices of milk and concentrates  and are in this regard  
not directly  comparable  with Irish circumstances  of today. However, 
the figures  give an insight  to the Dutch situation  which can be, in the 
same Common  Market.  Ireland ’s situation  tomorrow.
Tables  10 and 11 show that a margin  per cow over bought  in feeds of 
£400 to £500 was achieved.  The gross margin  per acre varied  from £300

from £0.52 to £1.06 per 100 kg. of milk. This results  in a net profit of

and feeding  policy  is expressed  in the variation  of costs of feedstuffs  from 
£1.78 to £3.73 from 100 kg milk. Here the average  Dutch farmer  can 
make further  progress.

Feeding  the Spring  Calving  Cow  
Under  Northern  Ireland  Conditions
by
F. J. GORDON.
Afiricultural  Research  Institute.  Hillsborough,  Northern  Ireland.
In Northern  Ireland  the pattern  of milk production  over the season  has 
traditionally  been more evenly  distributed  than in Southern  Ireland.  This 
has been due to the pricing  policy  of the Northern  Ireland  Milk Market ­
ing Board with a considerable  differential  in price in favour  of rnilk 
produced  during the winter being maintained.  This policy is similar  
to that used throughout  the remainder  of Great Britain  where,  because 
a large proportion  of the total milk produced  was required  for the liquid  
trade,  there was a need to stimulate  winter  milk production.  During  the 
late 1960 ’s the Milk Marketing  Board carried  out a reappraisal  of this 
policy and concluded  that, as only 25% of the milk produced  in Nor­
thern Ireland  was required  for the liquid  Market,  there was less need for 
such a high proportion  of winter  milk. It was therefore  decided  that it 
would  be to the overall  benefit  of the dairying  industry  if a greater  pro­
portion  of the milk was produced  during  the summer  period  at grass. On 
the question  of timing  of calving  in the spring  to produce  this milk at 
grass it was felt that, while late spring  calving  would  minimise  production  
costs per gallon,  milk output  per cow would be reduced.  A policy of 
January/February  calving  was therefore  adopted  as it was likely  to reduce  
production  costs considerably  yet also maintain  relatively  good yields  per 
cow. The monthly  pattern  of the prices  for milk paid by the Milk Market ­
ing Board was therefore  weighted  in favour of the January/February  
calving  cow by increasing  the price paid for milk during  the early spring  
months  and reducing  that paid for early winter  milk. During  the past four 
years this change  has resulted  in a significant  trend towards  early spring 
calving  as is demonstrated  by the production  trends shown  in Figure 1. 
Over this period  there has been no increase  in the quantity  of milk pro­
duced during  the autumn  but a considerable  increase  in that produced  
during the spring and early summer. It would seem likely that this 
trend will continue  for some period  in the future. It is for this reason  that 
a January/February  calving  herd was established  at the Institute  to pro­
vide information  on the optimum  management  of these animals.
Feeding  during  the dry period
Under Northern  Ireland conditions  these animals  will normally  be 
housed  by mid November.  They are given ad libitum  access  to medium  
quality,  direct  cut, grass silage. Silage intakes  have been monitored  dur-
75
Fig. 1. Seasonal  Pattern  of Milk Production  and Utilisation  in N. Ireland
ing the period from housing  until calving  and on average,  one cwt. of 
silage has been consumed  per day. The need to provide  concentrates  
prior to calving  depends  upon the level of nutrition  supplied  by the basal 
diet and the body condition  of the cow. In general  terms,  provided  live- 
weight  gains of 1^ - II lb. per day are being achieved,  additional  concen ­
trate feed is unlikely  to provide  an economic  response.  Over the past 
few years ad lib silage alone has produced  average  gains of H lb./day  
during  the last six weeks of pregnancy.  For this reason,  in the system 
used at the Institute  no concentrates  are given during  the dry period.
Feeding  during  iactation
Traditionally.  January  and February  calving  cows have been fed on a 
similar  basis to those calving  in the autumn.  This implies  feeding  to meet  
the animals  nutritional  requirements  for maintenance  and milk produc ­
tion coupled  with a degree  of ‘overfeeding ’ in early lactation  in order to 
stimulate  a high peak milk yield. At the outset  it was therefore  important  
to establish  if, in view of the shorter  time that the January/February  
calving  cow spends  indoors  post calving,  the level of feed could be re­
duced below that used for the autumn  calver. The date of going to 
pasture  in Northern  Ireland  is generally  around  mid-April,  except in a 
few of the areas with drier land.
76
An experiment  was carried  out over a two year period  using  two groups  
of cows to examine  the effect of reducing  meal levels. One group  was fed 
according  to their nutritional  requirements  with an averege  meal intake  
of 21 lb. per day from calving  until going to grass. The second  group  
received  on average  only 16 lb. meal per day and was therefore  nutrition ­
ally being underfed.  Both groups  had ad lib access to the same direct  
cut medium  quality  grass silage during  the lOf week post calving  indoor  
feeding  period. The effects  on milk yield both during  the indoor  period  
and at pasture  are given in Table 1 below. All cows were stocked  at the 
same rate at pasture  (mean  of 2.3 cows per acre over the grazing  season).

These  results  show that the cows given  the lower  level of meal feeding 
produced  20 gallons  less milk indoors  but went on to produce  more milk 
at pasture. The overall  result was that there was no effect on total lac­
tation  yield. This represents  a considerable  economic  saving  in feed costs 
to the farmer.
During 1975 and 1976 the effect of further  reduction  in meal feeding  
levels have been examined.  Average  meal intakes  of 16, 12 and 8 lb. per 
day from calving  until going to grass have been used. The results  for 
the first year of this trial are given in Table 2 below. All cows were 
stocked  at the same rate at pasture  (mean  of 2.3 cows/acre  over grazing  
season.)
These results showed  that when more severe underfeeding  was prac­
tised the response  in milk yield at grass was not sufficiently  high to attain

a similar  lactation  yield to the cows with the highest  concentrate  intake. 
Nevertheless  it is important  to appreciate  that even at the extremely  low 
level of feeding  used with Group  C the carry over effect on yield was only 
similar  in magnitude  to that of the direct effect. Even at this extreme  
level the carry over effect had not reached  the large proportions  of 2-3 
times the direct effect so often quoted  for the autumn  calver.
Although  at present  prices in Northern  Ireland  there is little difference  
between  the three groups  in terms  of milk returns  less the cost of concen ­
trates.  our present  advice  to the industry  would be to feed 16 lb. meal/  
day. This is particularly  important  if milk quality  as assessed  by solids  
non fat or protein  content  is to be maintained.  There  is also the fact that 
the animals  given the lower  concentrate  level will have a greater  require-  
met for silage. However  it is worth  bearing  in mind that even at low meal 
levels yields of over 1.000 gallons  per cow can be achieved  under good  
management.
The effects  on overall  animal  liveweight  and milk quality  are given in

Solids  non fat (%) 8.74 8.71 8.70
Pattern  of feeding
As the mean  period  from calving  until going  to grass is of 10 - 11 weeks  
duration  it was considered  important  to establish  if there was any dif­
ference  between  feeding  at a uniform  rate per day from calving  until 
turnout  and giving  the greatest  proportion  of the meal during  the period  
immediately  after calving  followed  by a period  of reduced  meal intake. 
This latter approach  would be in line with the information  produced  for 
the autumn  calver  by Dr. Broster  at the National  Institute  for Research  
in Dairying  in which the ability to obtain  a high peak yield has been 
shown  to be important.  Two systems  of meal allocation  were therefore  
tested. The first was a uniform  feeding  level from calving  until going to 
grass and the second  a high level for 4 weeks after calving  followed  by 
a lower level. The results  obtained  are given in Table 4 below.

Although  these are only the results from the first year of the two year 
trial It would seem that there is unlikely  to be any difference  between 
the two systems  of meal allocation.
Effect  of stocking  rate
In any system  which is based on achieving  a high output  of milk from  
grass It IS important  that the cows are properly  stocked  at pasture.  Two 
.stocking  rates of 2.6 and 2.0 cows per acre over the total grazing  season 
have been compared  over a 2-year  period. The effects  on production  are 
shown  m Table  5.

There was therefore  a considerable  decline  in milk yield per cow at the 
higher  stocking  rate. Nevertheless  in terms of output  per acre the higher  
stocking  rate resulted  in an extra 209 gallons  of milk per acre. This high 
output  of milk at 1,489  gallons  per acre demonstrates  firstly  the milk pro- 
ducmg  potential  of grass and secondly  the ability of the January  and 
February  calving  cow to exploit  this potential.  There  remains  the conflict 
for each farmer  of deciding  how far he is prepared  to increase  stocking  
rate at the expense  of performance  per cow.
General  conclusions
The results  obtained  at Hillsborough  have clearly  shown  that consider ­
ably lower daily meal inputs may be u.sed with the January/February  
ca ver during  the winter  than those normally  associated  with the autumn  
calver This reflects  the ability  of the spring  calver  to either  completely  
or partially  eliminate  the normal  detrimental  effects of obtaining  a low
79
peak yield when put to pasture. The results  demonstrate  the ability  to 
achieve  good yields per cow even at low meal inputs  and high stocking  
rates provided  the proper  animals  and management  level are used. How ­
ever, in Northern  Ireland  maximum  profitability  to the individual  farmer  
is obtained  by a mild rather than severe degree  of underfeeding.  With  
medium  quality  silage this would be obtained  by feeding 16 lb. meal.  
Nevertheless  the overall  efficiency  of the lowest  meal input system  is re­
markably  high and worth  consideration.  For example  the results  for 1975 
showed  an average  milk yield of 1,020 gallons  per cow with the u.se of 
51 cwt. of meal.
An assessment  of the total silage  consumed  along  with the area grazed 
indicated  that this was produced  at an overall  stocking  rate of 0.85 acres 
per cow. That is:
1 cow + 0.85 acres + 51 cwt. concentrates  produced  1.020 gal. milk.  
Assuming  5-1 cwt. concentrates  is equivalent  to 44 cwt. barley + 1 
cwt. of groundnut  and minerals,  44 cwt. barley  can be produced  from 
0.13 acres (based  on 35 cwt. barley/acre).
Total acreage  in overall  system  = 0.85 acres grass + 0.13 acres barley 
(0.98 acres).
Milk output  per total acre of land used in the system  is 1.041 gal. This 
is a very high figure  and represents  very efficient  use of our land resources. 
If such a system  is compared  with what would  be considered  a very good  
high input system,  a considerable  contrast  is obtained.  For example,  con­
sider a high yielding  herd producing  1,300 gallons  per cow and being  
given 30 cwt. of meal (2.6 lb./gal.)  this would be stocked  at a slightly  
lower  level of around  1 acre per cow in order  to allow the cow to achieve 
her potential.  Then:
1 cow + 1 acre gra.ss + 30 cwt. meal = 1,300 gals.
Again,  assuming  30 cwt. meal is equivalent  to 25 cwt. barley + 5 cwt. 
of groundnut  or other protein  supplements,  25 cwt. barley  can be pro­
duced  from 0.7 acres (based  on 35 cwt./acre).
Total acreage  in system  = 1 acre grass + 0.7 acres barley  (1.6 acres).  
Milk output  per total acre of land used is 765 gals, (ignoring  protein  
supplements).
In terms  of efficiency  of total land used in the system  this latter system  
only produces  73 per cent of that of the first system. In fact the system  
feeding  30 cwt. meal would require  to produce  an average  yield per cow 
of 1,770 gals, before  it would  become  as efficient  as the low input system.
These  calculations  are based on achieving  efficient  use of our land, but 
it is appreciated  that for the individual  farmer  it may be more profitable  
to buy acres by feeding  purchased  concentrates.  In this there lies the clear  
conflict  between  maximum  profitability  to the individual  farmer  and the 
overall  efficiency  of use of land resources.  This leads to the question  of 
where  does the future  of milk production  lie? Is it to be in a high yield  
system  based on imported  feedingstuffs  or is it to be based on achieving  
maximum  efficiency  in using our own land with minimum  inputs from  
outside?

SIXTH RICHARDS-ORPEN  MEMORIAL  LECTURE
Recent  Developments  in Reproductive  
Phvsiologv  in Cows
by
J. F. ROCHE.  M.AGR.SC., PH.D.
A<4ricitltural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Introduction
I would like to thank sincerely  the trustees  of the Edward  Richards-  
Orpen Memorial  Trust for inviting  me to present  the Sixth Memorial  
Lecture. I interpret  this invitation  as recognition  of the progress  made  
by the Agricultural  Institute  in reproductive  physiology.  I was not privi ­
leged to know Mr. Edward  Richards-Orpen  but from the tributes  paid to 
him by previous  speakers,  the loss was indeed  mine.
In 1974 cattle represented  46% (£238 million)  of total agricultural  out­
put and milk 33% (£180 million).  Of 1.8 million  calves bom, one-third  
were beef calves  and the remainder  came from the dairy herd. Usually,  
about 75% of dairy calves  are used for beef production.  Since beef and 
dairy production  account  for 79% of total agricultural  output,  it follows  
that the national  cow herd is the foundation  stone of agricultural  output.  
Therefore,  any increase  in reproductive  efficiency  of our cows will have a 
major  effect on agricultural  output,  farm income  and the national  econ ­
omy. Hence,  it is appropriate  to review  the reproductive  efficiency  of the 
national  cow herd.
Reproductive  efficiency  of national  herd
A 12 month  calving  interval  increases  annual  output  in dairy or beef 
suckler  herds. Hence,  the target must be to get each cow in calf within  
82 days of previous  calving. Hartigan,  Langley,  Nunn  and Griffin  (1974)  
found that the interval  between  calving  and first heat was 49 days in 86 
spring  calving  dairy cows in Munster.  Cunningham,  Shannon,  Fallen  and 
()'Byrne  (1976)  found that the calving  interval  of 44 spring  calving  dairy  
herds was 363 days, and the average  culling  rate was 12.2%. This indi­
cates a high level of reproductive  efficiency.  However,  in a survey  of the 
Leinster  area, which includes  winter milk producers.  Crowley,  Harti ­
gan and Lacy (1967) found that the average  interval  between  calving 
and first insemination  was 82 days and the calving  interval  was 380 days 
for the 89.9% of cows that calved. Thus, the calving  interval  may be 
slightly  longer in the Leinster  area than in other parts of the country  
where  winter  milk production  predominates.  Similar  data on the calving  
interval  in suckler  beef herds  are not available.
Over the past four years between  50% and 60% of cows were bred by 
artificial  insemination  (A.I.). In a survey  carried  out jointly  by The Agri ­
cultural  Institute  and Galtee  Cattle  Breeding  Station  on the reproductive  
efficiency  of cows following  A.I., 95% of the 3,096 dairy cows in the sur­
vey calved  to AT., which  is a very satisfactory  performance.  There  were 
significant  effects  of sire and of operator  on conception  rate. The day of 
the week and using the same or a different  sire for a repeat  insemination  
did not affect the conception  rate. Calving  difficulties  were reported  for 
4.4% of births,  and 3.7% of all calves  were born dead or died within  24 
hours. If the results  of this survey  are indicative  of the calving  rate to 
A.I. in the country,  they indicate  that conception  rate to A.I. is very sat­
isfactory  and as good in Ireland  as overseas.  Furthermore,  in a compari-  
sion of fertility  following  A.I. or a single  service  from a bull, no difference  
was obtained  (O'Farrell,  1973).
Calving  pattern
Over 85% of cows calve between  January  and June each year. Both  
beef and dairy production  systems  are based on maximum  utilization  of 
gra.ss and conserved  grass products  because  these are the cheapest  feeds  
available.  The large majority  of cows must calve before mid-March  in 
order  to achieve  maximum  production  from peak grass  growth  from April  
to June. Cunningham  et al. (1976)  reported  that the mean  calving  date of 
dairy cows was March 27 and Cunningham  (1972) also reported  that 
40.2% of 16,196 cows calved between  April and June. In Tipperary  
(County  Tipperary  N.R. Comm,  of Agr. Report,  1970- ’71) 34% of cows  
calved  after April 1 and it was considered  that the major  reason  for low 
milk yields was late calving. Type of mating,  natural  or artificial,  did 
not affect the calving  pattern,  indicating  that management  was the key 
factor responsible.  Late calving  resulted  in lower financial  returns  from 
the sale of milk and poorer  prices  for late born calves,  as well as prevent ­
ing maximum  production  from the use of early spring  grass.
In Tipperary,  it was also shown  that the calving  date of heifers  was 
even later than that of cows since 62% of the heifers  calved  after April 1. 
Cunningham  et al. (1976)  found that heifers  calved  on average  18 days 
later than cows (April 15). The late calving  of heifers  is a consequence  
of the majority  of calves  being  born in March  and April and heifers  being  
bred at 15 months  of age. Heifers  must calve down  as early as ptossible  in 
the calving  season  if an early calving  herd is the objective.  In the case of 
heifer  replacement  calves,  the earlier  they are born in the calving  season, 
the earlier  they can be bred the following  breeding  season. In the case of 
a cow, the date of calving  is the main factor  determining  when she can 
be re-bred  and therefore  it is difficult  to get them to calve much earlier  
the following  year.
In beef suckler  herds Barlow  et al. (1974)  reported  that the mean calv­
ing date was April 5. This late calving  date was a major  factor  in the pro­
duction  of light weanlings  in the autumn.
Financial  cost of late calving
In 1974 about 1.2 million  dairy cows calved  in the spring,  which  means
82
that about  480.000  calved  after April I. If the calving  date of these cows  
could be brought  back by 30 days, they would on average  produce  an 
extra 42 gallons  of milk per lactation  (Cunningham,  1972) at little extra  
cost since most of the production  would  come from early grass. National  
production  would increase  by 20.16 million  gallons  of milk, worth an 
extra £6.45 million  income  to dairy farmers.
Likewise  in suckler  cows,  if the calving  date could be brought  back by 
30 days, an extra 27 kilos of liveweight  at weaning  would result,  valued  
from £8 to £12. The half million  suckler  calves  could be worth  an extra  
£4 to £6 million  to the beef industry  of Ireland.  Therefore,  the national  
aim should  be to bring forward  the calving  date of all cows calving  after  
April 1, which  would  increase  significantly  milk and beef output.
Having  illustrated  the importance  of reproductive  efficiency  in the 
national  herd both to the country  and the farmer,  and shown  the economic  
loss that results  from the present  calving  pattern,  the remainder  of this 
lecture  will be concerned  with factors  affecting  reproductive  efficiency  in 
cows. The development  of new techniques  for controlling  reproduction  
will also be discussed  and the role they can play as an aid to the reproduc ­
tive management  of cows in present  day Irish farming  will be put in per­
spective.
Resumption  of reproductive  activity  after calving
There  is a wide variation  in the interval  from calving  to first heat. This 
interval  varies from 18 to 76.3 days for dairy cows and from 40 to over 
100 days for beef cows (Morrow,  Roberts  and McEntee,  1969). Clapp  
(1937) showed  that the frequency  of milking  affects this interval  since  
cows milked  four times daily had a 23-day  longer interval  than those  
milked  twice daily while continuous  suckling  by the calf or four times 
daily milking  resulted  in the same interval  to first heat. In experiments  at 
Grange,  first lactation  cows suckling  calves  had a mean interval  of 51.6 ± 
9.5 days from calving  to first observed  heat while animals  milked  twice  
daily had a mean interval  of 26.5±3.0  days. The level of milk production  
also affects  the interval.  It has been shown  that each increase  of 1,000 lb. 
of 4% milk delays  the post-partum  interval  by 1.5 days (Morrow,  Roberts  
and McEntee,  1969).
In autumn  calving  beef sucklers  at Grange  (Roche  and Drennan,  un­
published  data), both the plane of nutrition  and bodyweight  affected  the 
post-partum  interval  in first lactation  cows as is shown  in Table 1. This 
illustrates  the fact that heifers  should  calve down in reasonable  body con­
dition  and not lose weight  following  calving  until they are in calf again.
Heat detection
This is the key factor to efficient  reproduction  where artificial  insem ­
ination  is being used. The single most important  indicator  of heat in the 
cow is standing  to be mounted  by other animals.  However,  not all cows  
will stand to be mounted  and it is important  to watch for other signs  
such as restlessness,  presence  of clear mucus  on the vulva  or tail and a red 
or swollen  vulva. The proportion  of cows identified  as being in heat is

determined  by the number  of times each day the cows are checked  for 
heat. Research  in large dairy herds (Williamson,  Morris,  Blood and 
Cannon,  1972) has shown  that 9'^', of cows actually  in heat were missed 
when checks  were carried  out at 7.00 a.m., 12 noon and 4.00 p.m. This 
increased  to 16% if cows were checked  at 8.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m. A 
single  check resulted  in 25% of the cows in heat being missed. Between  
20 and 30% of dairy cows have standing  heat periods  of less than 7 hr. 
duration  (Esselmont,  1974). To pick out the maximum  number  of cows  
in heat, it is necessary  to check them four times daily at 7.00 a.m., 12 
noon.  4.00 p.m. and 10.00 p.m.
Efficient  heat detection  requires  an observant  stockman,  an easy sys­
tem of identification  such as plastic  ear tags or freeze branding,  a pencil  
and note book. Heat detection  cannot  adequately  be carried  out while  
animals  are being brought  in from the paddock  or during milking. It 
should  be done while the animals  are at pasture.
Beef cows
Heat detection  in beef cows is more difficult  than in dairy cows. The 
behavioural  signs of heat are less intense. They are also more prone to 
show silent heats and have a longer interval  from calving  to first heat. 
Thus, many beef farmers  use their own bull and therefore  cannot  avail 
of the higher  genetic  merit  of bulls standing  at A.I. stations.  In addition,  
choice  of breed  when using  natural  mating  is limited  by the cost of a bull.
Silent  heats
A silent  heat occurs  when  the cow releases  the egg from the ovary  (ovu­
lation)  without  showing  any visible  behavioural  signs of heat. The cow 
is ready  for breeding  but is not observed.  The frequency  of silent  heats is 
related  to the length  of the post-partum  interval.  In a large survey  in the 
U.S., 68% of cows had a silent ovulation  before first heat (Morrow.  
Roberts  and McEntee,  1969). Forty-four  percent  of ovulations  during  the 
first 60 days after calving  were not accompanied  by behavioural  signs of
84
heat while 11% of ovulations  60 or more days after calving  occurred  
without  oestrous  symptoms.  Hartigan,  Langley.  Nunn and Griffin  (1974)  
found  that 25% of dairy cows had silent heats up to day 60 after calving.  
High yielding  dairy and suckling  cows are more prone to have silent 
heats. The occurrence  of silent heats makes  it more difficult  to achieve  a 
365-day  calving  interval.
Synchronization  of oestrus
Because  time of standing  heat cannot  be predicted  in cows and due to 
the problems  of beat detection  and occurrence  of silent heats, work was 
begun  at Grange  in 1971 on methods  to control  the oestrous  cycle of the 
cow so that time of A.I. could be predicted  days or weeks in advance.  
The aim was to treat cows with hormones  for a short period  and insemin ­
ate at a pre-determined  time eliminating  the need for heat detection.  
Scientists  in many  countries  have been working  on this problem  and while  
heat can be synchronized,  the fertility  to matings  at the controlled  heat 
has been low (Jochle,  1972; Dziuk.  1974).  At Grange  the objectives  were;
i) develop  a practical  method  of administering  hormones  to cows.
ii) Overcome  the low fertility  at the synchronized  heat.
Control  of the oestrous  cycle
Before  discussing  synchronization  of heat, it is important  to describe  
the normal  pattern  of reproduction  in the cow. Following  calving,  dairy  
cows on average  will show first heat at about  six weeks  while  in beef cows,  
the return  to first heat is delayed  by a further  three to six weeks. A non­
pregnant  cow or heifer  will show heat about every 21 days with a range 
from 18 to 24 days. The length  of standing  heat in individual  cows can 
vary from one to 20 hr. depending  on age, season,  stress and nutritional  
status  of the cow. but generally  lasts 12 to 18 hr. in most cows. The egg 
is released  from the ovary (ovulation)  about 10 to 14 hr. after the end of 
standing  heat.
Following  ovulation  the egg passes  down the female  reproductive  tract 
and will meet sperm from the male if breeding  bas taken place. The 
follicle  on the ovary from which the egg has been released  forms a new 
structure  called a corpus  luteum.  which takes 4 - 5 days to reach maxi ­
mum size. This corpus  luteum  secretes  the hormone  progesterone  and at 
high concentrations  in the blood,  this hormone  prevents  the animal  from 
showing  any further  heats. While progesterone  levels are high, levels of 
other hormones  in the blood are low. About 16 or 17 days after heat in 
the non-pregnant  animal,  the corpus luteum degenerates  very rapidly,  
consequently  progesterone  levels in the blood fall and tbe levels  of lutein ­
izing and follicle  stimulating  hormones  and oestrogen  rise and normally  
within  2 - 4 days, the animal  is back in standing  heat, ovulates  again and 
a new cycle is initiated.
Methods  of synchronization
To synchronize  oestrus  in a group  of animals  it is necessary  to be able 
to control  the corpus  luteum  and thereby  the level of progesterone  in the
85
blood. This allows  one to predict  the time of next heat. There are two 
basic  approaches  to the problem  :
i) to administer  progesterone  for the length  of an oestrous  cycle of 
18 to 21 days. The progesterone  has little or no effect on the nor­
mal life span of the corpus luteum  but it prevents  the animals  
coming  into heat until the Corpora  lutea in all treated  animals  
have regressed.  When the progesterone  treatment  is terminated  
after 18 to 21 days, about  95% of the animals  will come into heat 
2 to 6 days later. However,  fertility  both to natural  mating  and 
A.I. is low at this synchronized  heat and this treatment  is of little 
commercial  value;
ii) to shorten  the life span of the corpus  luteum  by using either an 
oestrogen  in conjunction  with a short-term  progesterone  treatment  
(9 to 12 days) or by administering  prostaglandin  Fj. Following 
either  of these treatments,  fertility  has been reported  to be normal  
to A.I. at the synchronized  heat (Roche,  1974a; Sreenan,  1975;  
Wiltbank  and Gonzalez-Padilla,  1975; Chupin,  Pelot and Thimo-  
nier, 1975; Roche,  1976a).
Administration  of progesterone
The commercial  application  of oestrous  synchronization  in cattle with 
progesterone  requires  a simple,  practical  method  of administration  of the 
hormone.  Intravaginal  sponge  pessaries  have been tried but results  have 
been variable,  particularly  in cows, where the loss rate of the sponges 
from the vagina is higher than in heifers  (Carrick  and Shelton,  1967;  
Sreenan,  1974). Recently,  Sreenan,  (1975) has reported  good retention  
rates of sponge  pessaries  containing  progesterone  in heifers.
At Grange,  work has concentrated  on the development  of a silastic  
coil containing  progesterone  for the administration  of progesterone  
(Roche,  1976b). Stainless  steel strips 30 cm long. 3.2 cm. wide and 0.0203  
mm. thick were coated  with silastic  rubber  which contained  the proges ­
terone. Following  hardening  of the rubber,  the strips were coiled to a 
diameter  of 5.5 cm. and inserted  into the vagina  of cows or heifers  with 
the aid of a plastic  speculum  3.6 cm in diameter.  A nylon string which 
had been attached  previously  to the posterior  end of the coil was left 
protruding  from the vulva and this was used to remove  the coil subse ­
quently.  The smaller  the diameter  of the coil, the lower the number  of 
coils lost during treatment  (Table 2). The silastic  coil, therefore,  is a 
practical  method  of administering  progesterone  to cows.
Development  of a 12-day  progesterone  treatment
The development  of a 12-day progesterone  treatment  has been de­
scribed  previously  (Roche,  I974a,  b) and therefore  will only be summar ­
ized here. Initial work confirmed  that treatment  of heifers  with proges ­
terone  for 18 to 21 days resulted  in a high synchronized  oesrous  response 
but low fertility  to natural  or artificial  mating  at the synchronized  heat. 
Normal  fertility  was achieved  by reducing  the period of progesterone  
treatment  to between  9 and 12 days. This necessitated  using a second

hormone  at the start of treatment  to shorten  the oestrous  cycle by causing 
the corpus  luteum  to regress  prematurely.  Wiltbank  and Kasson  (1968)  
originally  used oestrogen  for this purpose,  but when we used oestrogen  
with a 9-day progesterone  treatment,  it was ineffective  in causing  prema ­
ture regression  of the corpus  luteum  in animals  shortly  after heat. How ­
ever, injecting  extra progesterone  with the oestrogen  in animals  between 
day 0 and 3 of the cycle at the start of treatment  resulted  in a high syn­
chronized  oestrous  response  when a 12-day  progesterone  treatment  with 
implants  was used (Roche,  1974a). The demonstration  that extra proges ­
terone was required  with the oestrogen  at the start of a 9 to 12-day  
progesterone  treatment  using implants  has now been confirmed  by others  
(Mauleon,  1974; Sreenan,  1975; Wiltbank  and Gonzalez-Padilla,  1975).  
Having  developed  a practical  method  for administering  progesterone  and 
an effective  12-day  progesterone  treatment,  which gave normal  fertility  
to A.I. after treatment,  farm trials were conducted  in 1974 to substantiate  
the value  of the new treatment  under  the different  management  situations  
prevailing  at farm level.
Results  of farm trials
In 1974, 412 Friesian  dairy cows received  the 12-day progesterone  
treatment  as described.  Following  removal  of the coils, the cows were  
inseminated  once as they came in heat 2 to 6 days after treatment.  The 
calving  rate in these cows was compared  to the calving  rate in 384 similar  
non-treated  cows on the same farms bred by A.I. These trials showed 
that the majority  of cows were detected  in heat the second  and third day 
after removal  of the coils and that calving  rate to a single insemination  
was similar  in synchronized  and control  cows (Table  3).
Having  established  the fact that the 12-day  progesterone  treatment  did 
not reduce  fertility,  experiments  were conducted  at Grange  and Clonroche  
to determine  if the time of insemination  could be fixed following  treat-

ment. Mature  Hereford  cross heifers were inseminated  as they were 
detected  in heat to serve as controls.  Similar  heifers  received  the 12-day  
progesterone  treatment  and were inseminated  at various  intervals  after 
treatment  (Table  4). Normal  fertility  was obtained  after the 12-day  pro­
gesterone  treatment  when heifers  were inseminated  after treatment  (a) at 
heat, (b) once at 56 hr. or (c) twice at 56 and 74 hr. A single  insemination  
at 74 hr. after treatment  resulted  in significantly  lower fertility. These 
results  indicate  that a single or two fixed time inseminations  would  give 
normal  fertility.
In 1975, further  farm trials were carried  out to confirm  if fixed time 
A.I. after a 12-day  progesterone  treatment  was practical  (Roche,  O'Far ­
rell, Prendiville,  Davis and Condon.  1976c). Two types of control  cows  
were used in order  to establish  the normal  level of reproductive  efficiency  
in the herds under study (Table 5). In the first group of controls,  the 
number  of cows that had already  been inseminated  was taken  to establish  
the normal  level of fertility.  In the second  type of controls,  cows selected 
at random  were checked  for heat over a 24-day  period  beginning  the day 
the coils were inserted.  They were inseminated  in normal  farm practice  
as they were detected  in heat. The number  of cows inseminated  during  
the 24-day  period  was taken to indicate  the normal  level of reproductive  
activity  and the number  of these that held to A.I. would  indicate  the fer­
tility level in the herds. Thus, it was possible  to compare  the number  of 
synchronized  and control  cows which  went in calf over a given period  of 
time.

The 120-day  non-return  rates for these Friesian  dairy cows are shown 
in Table 5. In the control  cows already  inseminated,  the non-return  rate 
was 66%. In the other  controls,  66% were detected  in heat by the farmers  
and inseminated,  and the non-return  rate of these inseminated  cows was 
the same as the first control  group. It is important  to point out that 34% 
of the cows in the latter  group  which  were not observed  in heat may have 
had a silent heat or may have been in heat, but were not detected.  This 
may indicate  that detection  of heat in dairy cows is a bigger  problem  than 
is at present  realized.  The retention  rate of the progesterone  coils (Abbott  
Labs.,  U.S.A.)  was 92% and the non-return  rate in these cows following 
insemination  once or twice on a fixed time basis after treatment  was 
similar  to controls.  Where synchronized  cows were to be inseminated  
following  an observed  heat, only 82% of the cows were detected  in heat
89
2-5 days after removal  of the coils and again the non-return  rate in these 
cows was similar  to controls.  The fact that a single insemination  at 56 
hr. after treatment  gave the same non-return  rate as two in.seminations  at 
56 and 74 hr. after treatment  indicates  that the onset of oestrus  was suf­
ficiently  precise  to allow  one insemination  to be used.
Significantly  more synchronized  cows  were inseminated  on the 14th and 
15th day after treatment  started  than in the control  cows over the 24-day  
jjeriod  when the farmer  was checking  for heat. A high submission  rate 
to A.I. was achieved  by using synchronization.  This should  result in a 
large batch of cows calving  early in the spring with consequent  higher 
milk yield. It would also allow farmers  to dry off all cows at the same 
time in the winter  with little effect on total milk production.
The effect  of progesterone  on the post-partum  interval
Experiments  were carried  out at Moorpark,  in conjunction  with my 
colleague  Mr. Kevin  O’Farrell,  in Friesian  dairy cows to determine  how 
long cows needed  to be calved  before  they will give a high synchronized  
oestrous  response  after the 12-day  progesterone  treatment.  The data in 
Table 6 show that a high synchronized  oestrous  response  was obtained  
in animals  which  were treated  30 or more days after calving  irrespective 
of whether  or not they had been previously  detected  in oestrus.

Since  40% of the control  cows were detected  in heat more than 45 days 
after calving,  this suggests  that the progesterone-oestrogen  injection  fol­
lowed by the 12-day progesterone  treatment  advances  the time of first 
heat after calving  in some cows. This would  have a beneficial  effect on 
the calving  pattern  in a dairy herd. In another  experiment,  23 late calving 
cows, in good body condition  and with an average  post-partum  interval  
of 24 days, were rectally  examined  and found to have inactive  ovaries. 
They were given  the 12-day  progesterone  treatment  (O Farrell  and Roche, 
unpublished  data). Within  3 days of removal  of the coils, 19 cows were
90
detected  in heat and were inseminated.  Thirteen  animals  were subse ­
quently  diagnosed  pregnant  to this insemination  and 11 calved down. 
This again suggests  that this 12-day  progesterone  treatment  advances  the 
time of first fertile  oestrus  in late calving  dairy cows.
Simplification  of 12-day  treatment
The present  treatment  consists  of the insertion  of a progesterone  coil 
into the vagina  for 12 days and an injection  of oestrogen  + progesterone  
at the start of treatment.  More recently,  we have found that, by using 
the progesterone  coil, the release  rate of progesterone  from the coil is 
sufficiently  large and rapid (Maurer,  Webel and Brown,  1975) that only 
oestrogen  need be injected  at the start of treatment.  In order  to eliminate  
the need to inject the oestrogen,  gelatin  capsules  containing  the horrnone  
were attached  to the inside of the coil. These capsules  dissolve  within  
1 hr. in the vagina  and release  the hormone.  Farm trials were conducted  
to determine  the efficacy  of the capsule  technique.  The onset of heat and 
the non-return  rate were similar  indicating  that capsules  were as effective  
as the injection  (Table  7). With the elimination  of injection,  the 12-day  
progesterone  treatment  is simple  and the idea of farmers  treating  their 
cows should  be considered,  having  made prior arrangement  for a single  
insemination  at a fixed time. As in sheep,  a similar  treatment  does not 
require  professional  supervision.

The 12-day  progesterone  treatment  developed  at Grange  is simple  to 
administer,  results  in normal  fertility  to a single insemination  on a fixed  
time basis and can induce  heat to occur  earlier  in late calving  cows.
Use of prostaglandins  to synchronize  oestrus
Effective  synchronization  of oestrus  necessitates  control  of the corpus  
luteum  and it has been demonstrated  that an injection  of prostaglandin
9i
will cause premature  regression  of the corpus  luteum  in cattle. However, 
prostaglandins  are not effective  in non-cyclic  animals  or in cyclic  animals  
for four or five days after heat. Therefore,  if a group  of animals  at dif­
ferent stages  of the cycle are treated  with prostaglandin,  about 66% will 
respond  to the first injection  and show heat 2-3 days later. These  animals  
are not bred but all animals  receive  a second  injection  11 or 12 days later. 
Following  this second  injection,  90 to 95% of animals  will be in heat 
within three days (Cooper,  1974; Hafs, Manns  and Drew, 1975). The 
use of the two injections  of prostaglandin  11 or 12 days apart is a simple 
method  of overcoming  the fact that animals  have to be at a certain  stage  
of the cycle in order to respond  to the prostaglandin.  To confirm  the 
efficacy of the synthetic  analogue  of prostaglandin  F^a (Estrumate,  
F.,a ICl Ltd.) to control  oestrus,  72 heifers  were given  two injections  each 
of 500 ug, 11 days apart. The occurrence  of oestrus  was determined  by 
observing  standing  heat. Thirty heifers  were found to be in oestrus  at 
48 hr., 21 at 72 hr. and 8 at 96 hr. after treatment,  while eight of the 13 
remaining  heifers  had cervical  mucus  indicative  of heat.
Another  method  to synchronize  heat is to u.se progesterone  coils to 
suppress  oestrus  for seven  days and then give a single injection  of prosta ­
glandin  on removal  of the coils to cause regression  of the corpus  luteum. 
This treatment  gives good synchronization  of oestrus  in cycling  animals  
and also results  in normal  fertility  to A.I. (Roche,  1976a).
Field trial results  with heifers
Friesian  dairy replacement  heifers were given a double injection  of 
Estrumate  11 or 12 days apart and were inseminated  at different  times 
after the second injection.  Control  heifers  were inseminated  at oestrus. 
The results  in Table 8 show that a single insemination  at oestrus  or two 
inseminations  on a fixed time basis 18 to 24 hr. apart gave normal  fer­
tility. A single insemination  on a fixed time basis 48. 60 or 72 hr after 
the second  injection  of Estrumate  resulted  in significantly  lower fertility 
than that of the controls.
Field trials were also carried  out on Hereford  cross beef cows (Roche,  
1967a)  allocated  as follows:  (i) a control  group  with animals  inseminated  
at oestrus;  (ii) a group  given the double  injection  of Estrumate  11 or 12 
days apart; (iii) a group which received  silastic  coils impregnated  with 
progesterone  for seven days followed  by a single injection  of Estrumate.  
Both groups  of treated  cows were inseminated  72 and 96 hr. after treat ­
ment. There were no differences  in fertility  between  control  cows and 
cows which received  the double  injection  of Estrumate  (Table  9). How ­
ever, significantly  more cows were inseminated  and calved  following  the 
progesterone-f  Estrumate  treatment  than in either the control  or double  
injection  treatment.  This demonstrated  the beneficial  effect of progester ­
one treatment  in post-partum  beef suckler  cows. A comparison  of control  
and synchronized  cows showed  that significantly  more synchronized  cows  
were bred during  the first 14 days of the breeding  season  and subsequently  
caJved  down  than in the control  cows,  demonstrating  that synchronization  
brings  calving  forward.

Comparison  of progesterone  and prostaglandin  treatments
The pregnancy  rates after the 12-day  progesterone  treatment  (Abbott  
Labs., U.S.A.)  and the double injection  of Estrumate  (ICI Ltd) were  
compared  in 321 mainly  Friesian  heifers  at pasture  and in 274 Hereford  
cross suckler  cows at pasture. Animals  treated  with progesterone  were  
inseminated  at 56 and 72 hr. after treatment  while animals  treated  with 
Estrumate  were inseminated  at 72 and 96 hr. after treatment.  There  were  
no differences  in pregnancy  rate following  either treatment  in heifers 
where  an overall  52% pregnancy  rate was obtained.  In the post-partum  
suckler  cows, significantly  more cows became  pregnant  following  the 12-
93
day progesterone  treatment  (55% pregnant)  than following  the double  
injection  regimen  of Estrumate  (32% pregnant).  This effect of proges ­
terone was explained  by the fact that 20% of the suckler  cows in these 
trials were diagnosed  as having  inactive  ovaries  at the start of treatment  
and in these cows response  to Estrumate  was poor whereas  the response 
to the 12-day  progesterone  treatment  was as good as in the cows diag­
nosed  as having  active  ovaries.  The double  injection  regime  of Estrumate  
is effective  in synchronizing  oestrus  in heifers  or beef cows that are cycl­
ing. It will not initiate  resumption  of reproductive  activity  in anoestrous  
cows and the results  obtained  in a group  of heifers  or cows will be directly  
related  to the number  that are cycling.  In addition,  it will induce  abortion  
in pregnant  animals  up to five months,  so every precaution  must be taken  
to ensure  that pregnant  animals  are not treated  with Estrumate.  If there  
is doubt as to whether  a cow is pregnant  or not, a veterinarian  should  
carry out a pregnancy  diagnosis  before  treatment,  and for this reason  it is 
available  commercially  through  veterinary  surgeons.
Other  methods  of synchronizing  oestrus
A synthetic  progestagen,  similar  in action  to progesterone,  and admin ­
istered  by a small ear implant  has been developed  by G. D. Searle  & Co. 
(Wishart  and Young,  1974). The recommended  treatment  consists  of a 
9-day treatment  with the ear implant  and an injection  of oestrogen  and 
the progestagen  at the time of insertion  of the implant.  Results  from the 
Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare  (Mulvehill  and Sreenan,  unpublished  data)  
of farm trials using this method  are given in Table 10. Results  from the 
use of an intravaginal  sponge  containing  3 gm progesterone  inserted  for 
10 days and an oestrogen-progesterone  injection  given at the start of 
treatment  (Sreenan,  1975) are also presented  in this table. Both of these  
methods  are effective  in synchronizing  heat. To date, they have been u.sed 
mainly  on heifers  and suckler  cows.

Advantages  and disadvantages  of synchronization
Synchronization  of heat allows  one to appoint  the time of A.I. weeks  
in advance.  There  is no need for heat detection.  It will also eliminate  the
94
problem  of silent heats if the progesterone  method  of synchronization  is 
used. It will allow the breeding  programme  to be planned  in advance.  
By treating  cows two weeks  in advance  of the breeding  season,  it is pos­
sible to inseminate  over half of the herd on the first day of the breeding  
season  and obtain  normal  fertility  in these cows. Thus,  a large batch of 
cows calving  early in the breeding  season  is obtained.  This should  ensure  
that sufficient  replacement  heifers  for the herd are born early and these  
can breed earlier  the following  year than in the case of a herd with a 
normal  calving  pattern.  In the case of summer  milk production,  all cows  
can be dried off at the same time in preparation  for calving.
Many farmers  with large dairy herds are not using A.I. because  of the 
problems  with heat detection  and consequently  poor calving  results.  How ­
ever. I feel that synchronization  should  allow these farmers  to use fixed  
time A.I. with as good results  as natural  mating.  They  would  then be able 
to use high genetic  merit A.I. bulls on enough  cows to have sufficient  
heifer  replacements  of better  genetic  merit. The advantages  of being able 
to use A.I. on a beef herd is that the farmer  will have a wide choice  of 
breed of sire and will be able to use fast growing  bulls, identified  for low 
frequency  of difficult  calving.
Farmers  must not expect  synchronization  to solve the problems  caused  
by poor management  and feeding.  Particularly  in dairy heifer  and suckler  
beef cows the results  obtained  are directly  related  to body weight  and 
plane of nutrition  of the animals  at time of treatment.  Animals  should  
be on a rising plane of nutrition  and be of sufficient  body size to ensure  
that they are cyclic. This applies  in particular  to autumn  and early spring  
calving  herds that may be on a low plane of nutrition  at time of mating. 
Synchronization  is an aid to the reproductice  management  of a herd, and 
not a substitute  for good husbandry.  It is important  that the conditions  
under which synchronization  works are known to farmers,  veterinary  
surgeons,  agricultural  advisers  and people involved  in the A.I. service, 
so that these techniques  will be used under  the proper  management  situa ­
tions. Advanced  planning  for calving  time is essential.  Cows  inseminated  
on the same day have a 10 to 20-day  calving  spread  due to variation  in 
gestation  length.
The reproductive  problems  associated  with beef suckler  cows were  
highlighted  in these trials. Behavioural  symptoms  of oestrus  were difficult 
to detect  and there was a long post-partum  anoestrous  period. The inter ­
actions  between  suckling  and nutrition  are obviously  important  in deter ­
mining  the time of initiation  of reproductve  activity  after calving. The 
effect of the progesterone  treatment  and post-partum  interval  on fertility  
needs to be defined  more clearly. Since all potential  breeding  animals  
in a herd are not showing  regular  oestrous  cycles  at the same time syn­
chronization  must involve  regulation  of heat in cyclic  animals  and induc ­
tion of fertile heat in non-cyclic  animals  capable  of responding.
Effect  of synchronization  on caiving  pattern
The present  calving  pattern  in a herd and the interval  from calving  to 
treatment  will determine  the number  of cows that can be synchronized
95
in a herd at any given time. Assuming  the calving  interval  and pattern  
found by Cunningham  et al. (1976) are representative  of the national  
spring  calving  dairy herd, and that cows can be treated  at a minimum  of 
35 days after calving  (Table  6) the effects  of synchronizing  different  pro­
portions  of the herd on the calving  pattern  can be determined.  In the 
case of the last one-third  of the cows, treatment  is started two weeks  
earlier  than normal  in attempts  to induce  heat in some of these cows. In 
Table 11. the calving  pattern  is shown  following  synchronization  of (1) the

first 30% of cows calved;  (ii) the first and last 30"o of cows calved  and 
(iii) the whole  herd in three batches  of 30%, 30% and 40% as they calve.  
It is apparent  that treating  the early batch and then treating  the late 
calvers  is probably  the best approach  as this results  in more cows calving 
early with a consequent  decrease  in the number  of late calvers.  Individual  
farmers  will require  different  calving  patterns  to suit their own particular  
systems.  It is important  to stress that provision  be made for more silage  
of higher  quality,  or more early grass or increased  use of concentrates  if 
more cows are going to calve early. This approach  to the use of syn­
chronization  in (he cow herd in conjunction  with earlier  calving  of heifer 
replacements  also through  synchronization,  will allow more culling  of the 
smaller  number  of late calvers  so that a 12-week  calving  season  could be 
obtained  within  a few years. This is the type of calving  pattern  we must  
aim for nationally  in order to increase  milk and beef output  from our 
existing  cow numbers.
OTHER  DEVELOPMENTS  IN REPRODUCTIVE  PHYSIOLOGY  
Pregnancy  diagnosis
Detection  of non-pregnant  animals  as soon as possible  after mating  is 
important  if a 365-day  calving  interval  is to be achieved.  Failure  to repeat  
three weeks  after mating  is generally  taken to mean that a cow is in calf.
96
The level of progesterone  which can be measured  by radioimmunoassay  
(Gosling.  Parker  and Fottrel,  1975) in blood,  21 days after mating  is dif­
ferent in pregnant  and non-pregnant  cows. It may be possible  to use this 
difference  as a simple  pregnancy  test. In farm trials, blood samples  were 
taken 21 days after insemination  and the level of progesterone  was 
measured  at University  College,  Galway.  Animals  with levels less than 
2.9 ng./ml.  were diagnosed  as being non-pregnant  while animals  with 
higher  progesterone  levels were diagnosed  as being pregnant.  From the 
results  in Table 12, it is apparent  that this test is accurate  in picking  out

non-pregnant  animals.  The accuracy  in picking  out pregnant  animals  is 
affected  by the fact that not all non-pregnant  animals  repeat  three weeks  
after mating. From the analysis  (Table 13) of the interval  from first in­
semination  to the repeat  insemination  in 757 Friesian  cows,  it is seen that 
about 70% of animals  repeat  between  day 17 and 24. However  a second 
peak of repeats  occurred  36 to 45 days after insemination  suggesting 
the possibility  that the.se were missed  at the three week stage or that they 
had a silent heat. The use of the progesterone  test 21 days after mating  
might help to pick up the majority  of the cows in this latter peak.

In dairy cows, progesterone  determination  can be carried  out on milk 
samples  and the commercial  application  of this test may help to shorten  
the calving  to fertile service interval. The capital cost of equipping  a 
laboratory  for this work will be high. It is possible  that a service  could  be 
operated  economically  from the Agricultural  Institute  research  labora ­
tories  or the individual  A.I. station.
The application  of synchronization  in conjunction  with the early 
pregnancy  test would  mean  that it would  be possible  to inseminate  a large  
group  of cows on the same day, then in 21 days a blood or milk sample 
would  be taken  and the non-pregnant  cows diagnosed.  These  would  then 
be given a single  injection  of prostaglandin  and inseminated  72 and 96 hr. 
later. In this way. a farmer  should  get 75% of the group  of cows in calf 
to A.I. within  30 days without  any need for heat detection.  These  are the 
kind of technological  advances  possible  within  a year but the major  limi­
tation  will be the cost involved.
Induction  of twinning  in cattle
The twinning  rate in a survey of 3,381 cows in Ireland  was 1.68"„.  
Obviously,  if twinning  rate could be increased  it would  be one of the most 
important  ways to increase  beef production  from the suckler  beef herd 
and from the dairy herd. Work in progress  at The Agricultural  Institute,  
Belclare  under Dr. J. Sreenan  and at University  College  Experimental  
farm at Lyons Estate under Prof. I. Gordon  has made tremendous  pro­
gress towards  the development  of a simple non-surgical  transfer  tech­
nique. The cattle insemination  equipment  used at present  by A.I. stations  
has been adapted  to allow  the placement  of a 5 to 6-day  old fertilized  egg 
into the non-pregnant  uterine  horn of a cow or heifer while the second  
uterine  horn carries  the cow ’s own fertilized  egg. Results  obtained  to date 
by these workers  are shown  in Table 14. If these results  are repeatable.

it may be possible  to have a high percentage  of cows producing  twins. It 
may also be possible  to increase  greatly  tbe number  of calves produced  
from really top class proven  cows by superovulation  and transfer  of their  
eggs to heifer  recipients.  However,  much research  work needs  to be done 
on appropriate  levels of feeding  in late pregnancy  of the twin bearing
98
cow, the mortality  rate of twins and subsequent  reproductive  perfor ­
mance  and longevity  of twin-bearing  cows.
Cystic  ovaries
During  the course  of farm trials in 1974, 20 dairy cows were diagnosed  
per rectum  to have follicles  greater  than 3 cm. which  were assumed  to be 
cystic. These cows were given an intramuscular  injection  of 100 ug. of 
gonadotrophin  releasing  hormone  (GnRH)  which causes an immediate  
large increase  in LH which is the hormone  responsible  for ovulation.  
The majority  of these cows returned  to heat about  three weeks  later and 
following  insemination  at heat, normal  fertility  was obtained.  Recent  re­
ports from the U.S. indicate  also that GnRH injection  is an effective  
method  of rupturing  follicular  cysts.
Conclusions
The low average  milk yields  (580 gals, in 1975 : An Bord Bainne,  Dairy  
News No. 173, Jan. 31, 1976) are caused  by (i) low level of feeding; 
(ii) late calving  of 40% of our herd and (iii) low genetic  merit of replace ­
ment heifers. Recent  developments  in new technology  in reproductive  
physiology  in Ireland  now make it possible  to influence  the latter two 
points. In our .spring  calving  dairy herd, the calving  pattern  can be in­
fluenced  by:
1. Synchronizing  the first and last one-third  of the herd with the 
12-day  proge.sterone  treatment  (Table  11). This will result  in more  
cows calving  earlier  and the mean calving  date of the herd will be 
brought  forward  by 11 days. In the economic  terms,  this repre ­
sents 15.4 extra gallons  of milk per cow giving  an extra output  per 
cow of £4.92.
2. Synchronizing  and inseminating  20% more heifer replacements  
than required  on the first day of the breeding  season. If, say 15 
are required,  and 20 are treated,  then 11 to 13 will go in calf to  the 
fixed time A.I. and it will be easy to get 3-4 more heifers  in calf 
at the repeat heat in three weeks time. Thus, sufficient  replace ­
ments are in calf within the first three weeks of the breeding  
season.
3. Synchronizing  the first 30% of the cow herd. These  cows will calve 
down 11 days earlier  giving enough  heifer calves born early for 
replacements  (15% replacement  rate). If we assume  they go in 
calf at the same age the following  year, then they will produce  11 
days extra milk. On a per cow basis in the herd over five lacta ­
tions, this is equivalent  to 11 x 1.4 x 5 x 15 -i- 100 = 12 gallons  of 
milk extra produced  by the heifers. This is worth  an extra £3.70  
per cow.
4. Increase  usage  of A.I. without  the problems  of heat detection.  The 
genetic  gain from using one of the proven  sires on the panel of 
special  bulls available  through  A.I. in Ireland  has been calculated  
to be worth  £7.50 per insemination  (Prof. E. P. Cunningham,  per­
sonal communication).
99
Other advantages  accrue from the use of synchronization  which are 
more difficult  to cost. These include  reduced  labour  required  for heat 
detection,  systematic  planning  of breeding,  feeding and calving pro­
grammes,  elimination  of problems  of getting  replacements  in calf and the 
possibility  of reduced  cost of A.l. If one assumes  these other advantages  
will pay for the cost of the treatment,  then the net calculated  value to a 
farmer  using A.l. at present  is £8.62 whereas  the value to a man not pre­
sently  using  A.l. is £16.12.
In the beef herd, reducing  the calving  interval  by 11 days will result in 
an extra 22 lbs. liveweight  of calves  at weaning.  The extra growth  rate 
from the use of the fast growing  continental  breeds  with a history  of low 
calving  difficulty  should  result in an overall  10% increase  in growth  rate, 
resulting  in about 44 lbs. extra gain. The total extra gain at weaning 
would  be in the order  of 66 lbs. If this extra gain were valued  at £18 per 
cwt. in the autumn,  it would  be worth  £10.62  per calf. This increase  would  
be much more critical  to the suckler  man than to the dairy man due to 
relatively  low returns  from suckler  beef production  at present.
In conclusion,  I think that the benefits  of synchronization  are worth  
the cost of using it both to the individual  farmer  and to the country.  The 
present  decline  in the use of A.l. is disturbing  and I believe  that the de­
velopment  of synchronization  will prove to be the biggest  breakthrough  
in reproductive  physiology  since the discovery  of A.l. and frozen  semen.  
A slow educational  process  to develop  its use will be required,  as in the 
use of A.I., but it is understandable  that the farmer  will require  over­
whelming  evidence  of the benefits  before  committing  his source  of income 
to the test.

NUTRITIONAL  EFFECTS  ON CARCASS  GROWTH  AND  
COMPOSITION  IN BEEF CATTLE
T. W. GRIFFITHS,
A/i Foras  Taluntais,  Dimsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
A combined  comparative  slaughter  and nutritional  balance  trial was 
used to compare  the effects of two levels of energy  and three levels of 
protein  on carcass  growth  and composition  in Friesian  steers over the 
range 120-400  kg. liveweight.  Higher  energy  levels  significantly  increased  
(P<0.01)  carcass  gains at all protein  levels but high protein  diets signifi­
cantly  (P<0.05)  increased  carcass  gains only at the higher  energy  levels.  
This latter effect was due in part to improvement  in digestibility  of fibre.  
The higher  energy  diets significantly  increased  separable  and total fat in 
the carcass.  The higher  protein  diets had no effect on lean meat per cent 
but preliminary  results  suggest  a small increase  in the protein  content  of 
the meat. The results  are discussed  in relation  to the efficiency  of current  
methods  of feeding  beef cattle.
BOVINE  EATING  BEHAVIOUR  IN WINTER  AND SUMMER
R. K. WILSON  and A. V. FLYNN,
An Foras  Taluntais,  Dnnsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
Co. Dublin.
A radio-telemetric  technique  for recording  time per day spent eating,  
ruminating  and resting by cattle is briefly described.  Cattle spent 4-5 
hours/day  eating  during  winter  (Dec./Jan.).  The type of silage,  method  
of feeding  or location  had little effect on this result. During  summer  
(July/Aug.)  animals  spend 7 to 8 hours/day  eating.
The results  suggest  that the time beef cattle spend eating is related  to 
day length. The short winter  days contribute  to the poor performance  of 
cattle on silage in winter.

MIXED GRAZING  OF CATTLE  AND SHEEP
T. NOLAN  and J. CONNOLLY,
A/I Fonts  Taluntais.  Creagh  and Sandynioimt  Avenue.
Most studies  of mixed v separate  grazing  used an equivalent  ratio of 
cattle to sheep to represent  equal grazing  pressure.  This approach  con­
founded  any effects of mixed grazing  with selection  of the appropriate  
equivalent.
In a three  year experiment  which  included  three sheep  only, three cattle  
only and seven mixed  cattle and sheep groups,  methods  were developed  
which  avoid these problems.  Fifty yearling  cattle and 280 weaned  lambs 
were used from mid-July  to the end of the grazing  season  in each year.
Linder mixed grazing,  gain for each animal  species  is related  to the 
stocking  rate for each species. By fitting regression  equations  to cattle  
and sheep  gains,  the results  showed  that about  4.25 lambs  would  replace 
one cattle beast and preserve  sheep performance  but about 8.79 lambs  
would  replace  one cattle  beast and preserve  cattle performance.  The sub­
stitution  rate varies  depending  on which  output  is considered.
Mixed  grazing  benefited  individual  lamb performance  (6-31%)  in all 
years and individual  cattle performance  in the first two years (9-33%). 
In the mixed  treatments,  both lamb and cattle performance  improved  as 
their respective  proportions  in the mix decreased.  A 10% increase  in out­
put per unit area was recorded  in one year.

REPLACEMENT  OF FISHMEAL  AND SOYABEAN  MEAL  BY DRIED  
MICROBIAL  CELLS (PSEUDOMONAS  METHYLOTROPHA)  IN 
THE DIETS OF WEANLING  PIGS
J. F. O'GRADY,
An Foras  Taluntais.  Moore  park. Ferinoy.  Co. Cork.
A meal (Pruteen)  made from the dried cells of pseudomonas  methly-  
lotropha  growth  on methanol  was made  available  by I.C.I. (Ireland)  Ltd. 
Samples  of the product  were analysed  for protein  and amino  acids as well 
as for fat, calcium,  phosphorus,  sodium  and ash. Twenty-four  pigs were 
used in 5-day digestion  trials to determine  the digestible  energy  (DE) of 
the meal.
On the basis of the above information  560 pigs weighing  8 kg. and 
weaned  about  one week were used in a growth  trial. Treatments  consisted  
of a control  diet containing  5% fishmeal  and 14% soyabean  meal and 
experimental  diets in which  the fishmeal,  soyabean  meal and fishmeal-F 
soyabean  meal were replaced  on an isolysine  basis by 5.6, 7.7 and 13.2%  
Pruteen  respectively.  Diets were balanced  for DE, lysine,  sulphur  amino  
acids, calcium,  phosphorus  and sodium. Pigs were fed ad libitum  over 
a 35-day  experimental  period.
The inclusion  of Pruteen  in the diet improved  feed intake,  FCE and 
growth  rate. The greatest  improvement  over the control  was observed  at 
at the highest  level of inclusion  of Pruteen  and amounted  to 4.3, 9.2 and 
13.8% respectively  in daily feed intake,  FCE and daily gain.

THE GROWTH  OF PREGNANT  FEMALE  LAMBS  AND THEIR  
PROGENY  IN RELATION  TO DIETARY  PROTEIN  AND ENERGY  
INTAKE  DURING  GESTATION
J. F. OUIRKE.  W. SHEEHAN  and M. J. LAWLOR.
The Agricultural  Institute,  Creagh,  Ball  inrobe,  Co. Mayo.
One hundred  and twenty-eight  4 Finn ] Galway  ewe lambs,  40 kg. 
liveweight  and about eight months  old, were individually  penned  from 
5-6 weeks after mating  until parturition.  The experimental  treatments  
applied  during  this period  consisted  of two levels  of energy  (8.0 and 12.0 
M J ME per day) with three levels of crude protein  (110. 155 and 220 
gms./day)  at each energy  level. A series of nitrogen  balance  trials was 
carried  out on six lambs from each treatment  during  the final 90 days 
gestation  (1.61 lambs/ewe).  Increasing  protein  intake  from the low to in­
termediate  level was accompanied  by a significant  increase  in maternal  
liveweight  gain; there was however  no response  to increasing  protein  
intake from the intermediate  to the high level. The ewes on the high 
energy  level were significantly  heavier  than those on the low level at all 
times between  60 days pre-parturition  and weaning  at 10 weeks post 
lambing.  There  was a significant  interaction  between  protein  and energy 
with respect  to lamb birth weight;  at the lower energy  level lamb birth  
weight  tended  to increase  with increasing  protein  intake but the reverse 
occurred  at the higher  energy  level. There was a significant  increase  in 
the level of nitrogen  retention  associated  with increasing  protein  and 
energy  intake.

INDUCTION  OF PARTURITION  IN GILTS AND SOWS USING  A 
PROSTAGLANDIN  ANALOGUE  (ICI 80996)
P. B. LYNCH  and O. H. LANGLEY.
A/! Fonts  Taluntais.  Moore  park. Ferinoy.  Co. Cork.
This experiment  involved  50 animals  (8 gilts and 42 older  sows)  on each 
of three treatments  as follows :
A Control.
B Parturition  induced  by IM injection  of 166 pg prostaglandin  analogue  
{ICI 80996)  at 9 a m. on day 111 of pregnancy.
C Induced  by injection  on Monday,  Wedne.sday  or Friday  when 111 or 
more days pregnant.
Parturition  commenced  29.4±6.5  hrs. (B) and 27.3  + 5.2 hrs. (C) after  
injection.  Six animals,  all gilts, farrowed  60-154  hrs after treatment  and 
are omitted  from the above;  control  animals  farrowed  90 + 32 hours after 
9 a.m. on day 111 of pregnancy.  Sixty-five  per cent of treated  animals  
commenced  farrowing  during  the working  day compared  with 50% of 
control  animals.  Birth weights  were marginally  higher (not significant) 
among  control  animals  while the number  of litters of low average  birth  
weight  (1 kg. or less) was A-1, B-5 and C-4. Litter  size at birth was higher  
among  the controls  and this was maintained  to weaning.  There  are indi­
cations  that some litters perform  poorly  following  induction  which may 
be due to poor milk production.

THE IMMUNE  STATUS  OF DAIRY  COWS  FOLLOWING  INDUCED
CALVING
O. H. LANGLEY  and K. J. O’FARRELL.
Af’riciilti4rcil  Institute,  Moorepark.
Corticosteroids  have been successfully  used to induce  parturition  two 
to three weeks before the expected  calving  date. This may be used to 
advance  late calving  cows and, as the calves  will be smaller,  difficult  calv­
ings can be avoided.
Corticosteroids  are anti-inflammatory  in their action and the large  
doses required  might be expected  to lower antibody  production  by the 
cow or inhibit  its absorption  by the calf. In addition  the time available  
for colostrum  production  is shortened  and the calf being weaker  might 
not be able to suckle  effectively.
Blood samples  were taken from thirty-nine  calves born to induced 
cows and twenty  three full term calves  at one day old. The blood serum 
was subjected  to the zinc sulphate  turbidity  test. There  was no difference 
in the levels  of immune  globulins  in the two groups  of calves.

FIXED TIME ARTIFICIAL  INSEMINATION  IN SHEEP
P, A. SMITH.  M. P. BOLAND  and 1. GORDON,
Department  of Farm Management.  Lyon. ’! Estate. Newcastle  P.O..
Co. Dnhiin.
Set-time  A.l. in conjunction  with progestagen-PMS  treatments  has been 
applied  to several  thousand  sheep in field trials over the last three years  
at U.C.D. Results  from the first years work show no significant  difference 
in pregnancy  rate following  A.l. and natural  service  (68.5%  and 71.4%  
respectively).  A.l. was carried  out on a much larger  number  of sheep in 
the second year and pregnancy  rates following  a double insemination  
confirmed  earlier  work with an almost  identical  result (68.6%).  Refine ­
ment of technique  to a single insemination  using a higher  concentration  
of sperm has given non-return  rates very similar  to natural  service  (76% 
vs. 83%) in the third years work. Various  factors,  such as progestagen  
treatment.  PMS dose level, timing of insemination  and insemination  
equipment  are examined.

REPEATABILITY  AND HERITABILITY  OF OVULATION  RATE IN
SHEEP
J. P. HANRAHAN,
An Foras  Taluntais,  Belclare.
Information  on the number  of corpora  lutea (ovulation  rate) of mature  
Finn, Galway.  Fingalway  and High Fertility  ewes was obtained  during  
the breeding  seasons  of 1973 through  1975. Repeated  ovulation  rates were  
either  within  the same breeding  season  (intra-year)  or in adjacent  breeding  
seasons  (inter-year).  The average  ovulation  rate for Finn ewes was 4.0 
compared  with 1.6 for Galways.  The Fingalway  ewes averaged  2.4 and 
High Fertility  ewes averaged  2.7. Repeatability  of ovulation  rate differed  
significantly  among  the breeds  with a value of 0.2 for Galway  and Fingal ­
way ewes compared  with 0.7 and 0.8 for Finn and High Fertility  ewes,  
respectively.  The degrees  of freedom  for these estimates  ranged  from 32 
to 104. There were no substantial  differences  between  intra- and inter- 
year estimates.  The heritability  of ovulation  rate was estimated  to equal  
0.3 in Finns but the estimate  was slightly  negative  in Galways.
These results together  with information  from egg-transfer  work are 
discussed  in relation  to selection  for ovulation  rate and breed differences 
in litter size.

INDUCTION  OF SUPEROVULATION  IN THE BOVINE
D. BEHAN,
An Foras  Taluntais.  Belclare.
An important  prerequisite  in any egg transfer  programme  in cattle is 
that reliable  methods  should be available  for obtaining  a predictable  
supply  of fertilised  eggs. Recent  experiments  at Belclare  have compared  
three methods  of superovulation-  (I) Prostaglandin  + PMSG (Pregnant  
Mares ’ Serum  Gonadotrophin),  (2) Prostaglandin+  PMSG,  (3) Norgesto-  
met (SC 21009)  + PMSG.
Oestrous  responses  of 96.7%,  80.4% and 90.6';;, respectively,  were 
obtained  following  the use of the three methods.  Oestrous  synchroniza ­
tion was best with Prostaglandin  treated  animals,  84.2%  of which  showed 
oestrus  over a 24 hour period,  compared  to 40.2%  and 39.3% following  
the Progesterone  and the Norgestomet,  respectively.  There  was an effect  
of PMSG —oestrus  interval  on the proportion  of follicles  ovulating.  The 
mean number  of ovulations  using  2000 iu PMSG  was 14.7, 11.2 and 12.7 
following  Prostaglandin,  Progesterone  and Norgestomet  respectively.  A 
dose-response  relationship  was evident.

FERTILITY  IN CATTLE  FOLLOWING  SHORT-TERM  (10-DAY)  
OESTROUS  CYCLE  CONTROL  TREATMENTS
P. MULVEHILL.
An Foras  Taluntais,  Belclare.
A practical  method  for controlling  the bovine  oestrus  cycle would  have 
numerous  advantages  in both beef and dairy herds. Work  on the develop ­
ment of methods  for controlling  the oestrous  cycle,  based  on the use of 
progestagens,  has resulted  in the development  of a number  of short-term  
(9-10  day) treatments.
A series  of studies  examining  the efficiency  of a number  of progestagen  
treatments  were initially  carried  out. This included  a study of the effects  
of treatments  on endogenous  hormone  levels,  oestrous  response  and de­
gree of synchronization  and subsequently  a series of field-trials  were 
undertaken  to evaluate  these short-term  progestagen  treatments.  A total 
of 2,650 animals  were treated  during  the 1974 -’75 breeding  seasons.  The 
treatments  were progesterone  and cronolone  (SC-9880)  applied  by intra ­
vaginal  pessary  and norgestomet  applied  by subcutaneous  ear implant.
Retention  rates of 100% were obtained  with the SC-21009  implants  in 
both heifers  and cows. Retention  rates of 97% and 90% in heifers  and 
cows, respectively,  were obtained  with intravaginal  pessaries.  Calving 
rates of 60%, 50% and 54% for progesterone,  SC-21009  and control  
animals  respectively,  were obtained  with heifers  following  a fixed-time 
A.l. procedure.  In suckler  cows calving  rates of 48% and 56% were 
obtained  following  progesterone  and SC-21009  treatments,  respectively.
The application  of gonadotrophin  (H.C.G.)  or gonadotrophin  releasing 
hormone  (Gn-RH)  in combination  with the progesterone  treatment  re­
sulted  in a more precise  control  of ovulation.  However  Gn-RH  or H.C.G. 
did not affect fertility  when a double  insemination  routine  was applied.  
Reducing  the number  of inseminations  to one reduced  fertility.

TWINNING  IN BEEF  CATTLE  BY AN EGG TRANSFER  TECHNIQUE
M. P. BOLAND,  T. F. CROSBY  and I. GORDON,
Department  of Farm Management.  Lyons Estate.  Newcastle  P.O..
Co. Dublin.
The establishment  of twin pregnancy  in beef cattle by surgical  and 
simple  non-surgical  egg transfer  techniques  was reported.  Fertilized  eggs 
were provided  following  hormonal  induction  of super-ovulation  using  
PMS and HCG - a technique  that has yielded  a mean of about  8 fertilized  
eggs per donor treated. Recipient  animals  were inseminated  at a spon ­
taneous  oestrous.  and eggs transferred  5 or more  days following  breeding. 
An overall  pregnancy  rate of 62.5% and 61.5% was obtained  following 
surgical  and non-surgical  transfer  respectively.  The corresponding  twinn ­
ing rates were 48% and 41%. Regardless  of method  of transfer,  preg­
nancy,  twinning  and egg survival  rates were higher  following  a period  of 
storage  in the rabbit oviduct.  Various  factors  including  site of transfer,  
medium  used and ease of transfer  are discussed.
EGG TRANSFER  IN THE COW  : EFFECT  OF SITE OF TRANSFER
J. M. SREENAN.
The Af>ricultural  Institute.  Belclare.
The application  of single or twin egg transfer  techniques  in the cow 
depends  ultimately  on the development  of a simple  non-surgical  transfer  
procedure.  Success  in non-surgical  attempts  to date has been lower  than 
following  surgical  transfers.  To determine  the effect of site of transfer,  
fertilized  eggs were transferred  either bilaterally  or singly  to each uterine  
horn. Eggs were transferred  both ipsilateral  to the CL and contralateral.  
Survival  in single pregnancies  following  bilateral  transfer  was 65% ipsi­
lateral to the CL and 35% in the opposite  horn. Following  single egg 
transfers,  survival  was 61.3%  ipsilateral  to the CL and 18.1%  in the con­
tralateral  horn. When eggs were deposited  near the uterotubal  junction  
survival  rate was similar  to eggs transferred  near the common  body (60% 
and 65%).

THE PERFORMANCE  OF LAMBS  AND HOGGETS  ON 
ON CONCENTRATE  DIETS
J. L ESTRANGE,  J. MURPHY  and C. SPILLANE,  
Department  of Agricultural  Chemistry,  U.C.D.
The results of a series of experiments  on the performance  of early 
weaned  lambs (aged about 7 weeks) and of hoggets  (aged about 10 
months),  fattened  ad libitum  on unpelleted  concentrate  diets were re­
ported.
It was observed  that the liveweight  gain and the food conversion  ratio 
were very similar  between  Finn-Dorset  and Suffolk  cross lambs. For all 
lambs  the average  liveweight  gain was 250g/d  and the average  food con­
version  ratio was 3.3 g DM/g  gain. Hoggets  on the same dietary  treat ­
ments  had lower  weight  gains (184 g/d) and had a higher  food conversion  
ratio (5.8 g DM /g gain).
The weight  gain of lambs  was slightly  higher  with ground  maize than 
with ground  barley  as the sole cereal source. Whole  barley  as the sole 
cereal source resulted  in the same performance  of lambs as ground  
barley. Supplementation  of barley based diets with 10% oat hulls or 
chopped  hay (10 or 20%) or chopped  straw (7.5 or 15%) reduced  live- 
weight  gain of the lambs. Problems  relating  to this system  of lamb pro­
duction  were disscussed.
