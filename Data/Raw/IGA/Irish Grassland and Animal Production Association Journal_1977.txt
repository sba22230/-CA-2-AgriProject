Hay still accounts  for a greater  proportion  of conserved  dry matter  than 
silage,  although  the quantity  of silage dry matter  conserved  has doubled  
over the last 10 years. Despite  improvements  in grass utilization  and 
conservation,  beef cattle still rely heavily  on cereal-based  concentrates,  
particularly  during  the winter  months.  It has been estimated  that 2.9 m 
tonnes  of concentrates  are used annually  in beef production  systems  and

this represents  some 30% of UK barley grain production  (Wilkinson,  
1976). Currently,  beef systems  which fatten animals  from the dairy herd 
for slaughter  at about 2 years of age, and those over-wintering  suckled 
calves,  rely least on concentrated  feeds. In these systems  some 40% of 
energy  is supplied  by concentrates  (Table  1). The high usage  of cereals  in 
most cases arises because  the herbage  is too mature  when harvested,  and 
consequently  its D value is low. Feeding  silage with a low D value has a 
marked  effect on growth  rate if the silages  are offered  alone and on the 
amount  of additional  cereals  required  to achieve  target growth rates  
(Table 2). A silage of moderate  quality  with a D value of 58 together  
with 0.75 Ib/day  barley will support  a daily gain of 1.0 lb in a steer 
weighing  8 cwts,  whereas  a very good silage  will give twice the daily  gain 
if supplemented  with 2.75 Ib/d of barley.

Most beef production  systems  are concerned  with converting  home ­
grown  feeds into live weight  and ultimately  carcass  meat, and the costs  
of these feeds must be considered  when planning  a feeding  programme.  
The yield of dry matter  and energy  for various  feeds together  with total 
costs of production  are given in Table 3. The costs were provided  by 
the Farm Management  Division  of the North of Scotland  College  of 
Agriculture  (NOSCA)  for average  crop yields,  and include  variable  costs,  
equipment  and storage  costs, interest,  rent and general  overheads  oper­
ating in June 1975. A number  of the feeds provide  considerably  more 
energy  per acre than barley  grain,  and those feeds supplying  the highest 
yields also provide  energy  at the lowest  cost.

Supplements  with conserved  feeds
When conserved  forages  are used for beef production  it is usually  the 
aim to use as much of the forage  as possible  and to use supplements  to 
make up any deficiencies  that are found on analysis  of the forage. A
shortage  of energy  may occur  through  the conservation  of mature  herbage  
or herbage  cut from late season  regrowths.  When it is found  necessary  to 
offer a supplement,  this is usually  provided  in the form of cereals  and the 
amount  of cereals  offered  has a marked  effect  on the intake  of silage.  An 
experiment  was conducted  by Dr. Broadbent  at NOSCA  in which dif­
ferent ratios of grass silage and rolled barley were offered  to Friesian  
steers. Animals  offered  20% barley (i.e. 3.5 Ib/d) consumed  a similar  
amount  of silage to that of animals  offered  only silage. As the amount  
of barley  offered  was increased,  the barley  substituted  for silage and the 
amount  of silage eaten dropped  (Table  4). The extent  of the substitution  
increased  as the proportion  of barley  in the feed was inereased.  In trials

conducted  at the Rowett  Institute  the value of chopped  swedes  or fodder-  
beet as alternatives  to barley  have been compared  using  grass  silage  made  
from  wilted  and unwilted  material.  When  a supplement  of 4^ lb swede  dry 
matter  was offered it was found that silage intake was lower with un­
wilted silage containing  18% dry matter  than silage made from similar  
herbage  but containing  26% dry matter. This was not found when 
chopped  fodderbeet  was used. In these trials the supplement  containing  
4^ lb swede  or fodderbeet  dry matter  had a similar  effect  on silage  intake  
depressing  it by some 22%. These same supplements  have subsequently  
been compared  in a trial with Friesian  steers  given  grass silage  containing  
20.5%  dry matter  and D value 65, and grown  from 8 cwt to slaughter  at 
10 cwt. The results are given in Table 5. There were no significant 
differences  in feed intake  or rate of gain due to the supplement.  Killing- 
out percentage  was lower  for animals  given swedes  or swedes  with barley.  
On the basis of the costs given in Table 3, the cost of supplying  the 
swedes  or fodderbeet  is likely  to be about  65% of that for the supplement  
of rolled barley.
The green brassicae,  such as kale and cabbage,  are highly  digestible  
and like the swedes  can produce  high outputs  of feed per unit area. There

is no information  on their value as a replacement  for cereals  in diets for 
beef cattle. They do, however,  suffer  from a disadvantage  not apparent  
with the root brassicae  in that they contain  goitrogens  and high concen ­
trations  of a haemolytic  constituent  which may mean that their intake 
must be controlled  if the animals  are not to suffer from anaemia  and a 
period of inappetance.  Green brassicae  cou'd be used to replace  con­
centrates  in feeds for beef cattle particularly  when the concentrates  are 
used as a supplement  to silage. It could be that using green brassicae 
wou'd not depress  forage  digestibility  to the same extent as that with a 
supplement  of concentrate  (El-Shazly,  Dehority  and Johnson,  1961).
In most of the experiments  in which different  supplements  have been 
examined,  it has been customary  to offer these twice daily  with the forage 
offered  to appetite.  In this situation  it has been argued  that at certain  
times of the day rumen  pH may fall below  that considered  optimum  for 
the most efficient  digestion  of plant  fibre. As a result  the intake  of forage 
would  be reduced.  Experiments  have been reported  in which  the intake  
and digestibility  of feeds offered  as a complete  diet or separately  have 
been compared.  A growth  and digestibility  trial has been reported  by 
Zea Salgueiro  (1975) and an intake and digestibility  trial made at the 
Rowett  Institute.  In the trial with growing  steers, the animals  were 
offered  different  ratios  of barley  to grass silage  and the barley  was offered  
once daily,  twice daily or mixed  with the silage. The silage intake  of all 
the animals  that were offered  their barley twice daily was higher  than 
that of animals  offered  the complete  diet or once daily feeding  of barley. 
Once daily feeding  of barley reduced  total feed intake  to the greatest  
intake when there were high proportions  of barley in the diet. In this 
trial the live weight  gain and organic  matter  digestibility  were not affec ­
ted by the frequency  of feeding  the barley. These results  are supported
by the results of the digestibility  trial in which feed intake and the 
digestibility  coefficients  for dry matter  and crude fibre were similar  when 
dried grass  was offered  to appetite  alone,  or with barley  given  twice  daily,  
or barley  was given alone in the morning  and dried grass alone at night  
(Table  6). These  experiments  would  suggest  that unless  a high proportion  
of concentrates  are being  fed once daily there is likely  to be no benefit  to 
be gained,  in terms  of more efficient  beef production,  from using a com­
plete diet rather  than separate  feeding  of the forages  and concentrates.

This view on complete  diets is reinforced  by recent  observations  made  
at the Rowett  Institute  on animals  that were offered  silage  to appetite  and 
either  4^ or 9 lb rolled  barley  in two feeds  daily. Measurements  of rumen  
pH made before the meal of barley and at hourly intervals  thereafter,  
showed  only small declines  in pH, the largest  being from 7.2 to 6.7 with 
9 lb barley. In these experiments  the rate of digestion  of plant fibre in 
the rumen  was not affected  by the amount  of barley  offered  which was 
not surprising  in view of the small decline  in rumen  pH. It would  appear  
therefore  from these observations  that variations  in rumen  pH are not the 
main cause of the depression  in silage that occurs  when highly  digestible  
feeds like barley  or swedes  are offered  to beef cattle.
Substitution  of cereals  by fodder  crops
The attraction  of using fodder  crops in beef production  systems  is that 
they are likely to provide  cheaper  energy  than cereals. The greatest  im­
pact is likely to be in intensive  systems  that at the present  time rely 
heavily  on cereals. Root crops have been used for a long time as a feed 
for cattle but they are now a more attractive  feed to grow. A number  
of experiments  have been made with sliced swedes  and with chopped  
fodderbeet.  A summary  of the results  of these is given in Tables  7 and 8. 
In the trials using swedes,  daily dry matter  intake  and rate of gain were  
lower  over the first month  of the trial for animals  having  more than 66% 
of the dry matter  supplied  by swedes.  As a result,  their overall  dry matter

intake and rate of gain were lower than those of animals  offered  only 
barley. The lower feed intake over the early part of the trial was not 
apparent  with the fodderbeet  and as a result  daily gains were better  with 
fodderbeet  than with swedes.  In these trials animals  offered  only swedes  
or fodderbeet  consumed  about 140 or 85 lb respectively  of the feeds  daily.  
Associated  with the high intake  of swedes  was a high urine output  and 
an increased  demand  for straw bedding.  In practice,  the intake of root 
crops could be controlled  by the amount  of barley  offered;  for example,  
steers weighing  6 cwt and offered  6 lb rolled barley  would eat about 75 
lb swedes  and their daily gain should  be about  2 lb. Killing-out  percen ­
tage was not affected  by the inclusion  of the root crops in the feed and

carcasses  from animals  given roots were similar  to those of animals  given  
only barley. On the basis of the trials made so far the value of swede  
and fodderbeet  dry matter  has been about 85% of that of barley dry 
matter.
When straw is used in diets for fattening  beef animals,  it is usually  
considered  essential  that it should be mechanically  processed  so that it 
can be mixed  with the concentrates  to form a complete  diet. A complete  
diet containing  a mixture  of concentrates  and milled straw is a safe 
method  of feeding  a relatively  large amount  of concentrates  daily. Milling  
the straw,  however,  does not affect  its digestibility  but with young  animals  
may increase  the amount  eaten. In addition  to the milling  of straw there  
are now available  chemical  treatments  that increase  its D value by 50%.  
Since the D value of straw  can vary from 28 to 40 (Palmer,  1976) careful  
selection  of straw and rejecting  straw from those varieties  known  to have 
a low D value will be most worthwhile.  Typical  results  achieved  using 
Friesian  steers weighing  5 cwt and given complete  diets containing  a 
mixture  of concentrates  and 15 or 30% straw are given in Table  9. Daily  
live-weight  gain and carcass  gain declined  as the proportion  of straw in 
the diet was increased  so that feed conversion  was poorer  with diets con­
taining  straw. In addition,  the proportion  of “fill” in the alimentary  tract  
increased  when straw was included  in the feed and this reduced  the 
killing-out  percentage.  In Table 10 the relative  values  of diets containing

ground  straw are given,  these being based on differences  in feed conver ­
sion for animals  grown from 5^ to 8|^ cwt. These indicate  the relative  
cost of diets containing  different  proportions  of ground  straw so that the 
cost per unit live-weight  gain is similar  to that of animals  given concen ­
trates alone. Furthermore,  it allows  an estimate  to be made of tbe cost 
that could be attributed  to the straw. This would include  its purchase  
price, mechanical  processing  and subsequent  mixing  of the feed. There

would appear  to be no justification  for including  small proportions  of 
ground  straw in the feed but with feeds containing  30-50%  straw, the 
straw costs must not exceed  £23-30  per ton respectively.  Similar  calcula ­
tions based on the use of chopped  straw for fattening  beef cattle are 
given in Table 11. From these figures  there would seem to be no justi­
fication  for using  chopped  straw with a concentrate  mixture  for fattening  
beef cattle.

Trials  with Friesian  cattle grown  from 6-9 cwt have been made at the 
Rowett  Institute  with barley straw treated  with sodium  hydroxide  to 
improve  its nutritive  value (Pirie & Greenhalgh,  1977). Calculations  like 
those for Tables  10 and 11 indicate  that barley  straw,  coarsely  milled  and 
treated with sodium hydroxide,  and included  at between  40-60% in 
feeds for beef cattle,  must cost no more than about  £35 per tonne.
There are a number  of alternative  ways in which the efficiency  of a 
beef enterprise  could be improved  by increasing  the output  of live-weight 
gain from a given area of land and reducing  its cost of production.  Some  
of the ideas already  discussed,  if implemented,  could mean radical  chan ­
ges to an existing  feeding  and cropping  programme,  and may create  
problems  in the distribution  of labour. Many of them involve  increases  
in the amounts  of feed that have to be handled  and perhaps  processed. 
There are really no generalisations  that can be made and final decisions  
must involve  the individual  farm when an overall  view can be taken to 
decide  whether  any changes  are really worth  while.

Oplimuni  Beef Output  from Silage

Introduction
For many years, conserved  forage for beef cattle was only expected  to 
supply  maintenance —live-weight  gain being obtained  from the inclusion  
of large quantities  of cereal and protein  in the diet. Quality  of forage  for 
the beef animal was of a low priority,  quantity  being the major con­
sideration.  In contrast,  greater  emphasis  has been placed  on the quality  
of forage  for the dairy cow than for the beef animal.
This being the case, what is the potential  of high quality  silage for the 
beef animal  ? Should  the aim be to realise  the potential  of high quality  
grass silage ? If the answer  is ‘yes’, the question  of how to produce  high 
quality  silage immediately  arises. If the silage is high quality,  is supple ­
ment required  and, if so, how much  ? The conflict  between  quality  and 
quantity  must also be resolved.  If the silage is of high quality  will stock 
numbers  have to be reduced  ?
Animal  production  from silage
The potential  of grazed  grass for promoting  high live-weight  gains in 
beef animals  is well recognised.  In most instances,  however,  grass silage  
has a much lower potential  for producing  live-weight  gain and is often 
only capable  of providing  maintenance.  Methods  of improving  the rate 
of gain from grass silage have been investigated  at Hillsborough.  This 
paper reports  results  from experiments  on silage quality  and the results  
have been used to calculate  beef output  per acre to enable  conclusions  
to be drawn  on the optimum  output  of beef from silage.
Several  factors  influence  animal  production  (either  live-weight  gain or 
milk yield)  from grass silage  and these include  stage of growth  of grass at 
harvest,  fermentation  quality  and the dry matter  content  of silage. Of 
these,  perhaps  the major  factor  affecting  the level of animal  performance  
is the stage of growth  at which grass is cut. If high quality  material  is 
not harvested,  then the opportunities  for improving  animal  performance  
from silage by manipulation  of the other factors are virtually  non­
existent.  Silage  can never  be better  than the grass from which  it is made.
At Hillsborough,  the effect of stage of growth  of grass at ensiling  on 
animal production  has been examined  in two experiments.  Stage of 
growth  was determined,  primarily  by cutting  date, and subsequently  by 
the interval  between  cuts. In the first experiment  the intervals  were 5^, 
7 and 9 weeks  and harvesting  began  on 11th May,  21st May and 4th June  
respectively.  In the second  experiment,  which  was designed  to investigate 
the performance  of animals  offered  high, medium  or low quality  silage
15
with different  levels of barley,  the regrowth  intervals  were 6, 9 and 12 
weeks  with harvesting  commencing  on 14th May,  4th June and 25th June 
respectively.
In both experiments  grass from 20 acres of an S24 perennial  ryegrass/  
SlOO white clover  sward,  sown in 1967, was used. The sward  was closed  
for silage in January  and fertilizer  in the form of a 2:1:1 compound  was 
applied  at the end of March. In the first experiment  a total of 300 units 
N, 150 units P^O^ and 150 units K^O were applied  per acre during  the 
season,  applications  being split equally  between  cuts with each regrowth  
interval  (i.e. for a 9 week interval  giving  3 cuts over the season,  100 units  
N, 50 units P and 50 units K were applied  per acre for each cut). In the 
second  experiment  fertilizer  was applied  at the rate of 1.6 units N per 
acre per day for the duration  of the regrowth  interval,  up to a maximum  
of 100 units.
Harvesting  took place throughout  the growing  season  and grass yield  
was recorded.  The grass was direct  cut using a flail forage  harvester  and 
formic acid was applied  as an additive  at the rate of J gallon/ton  of 
fresh grass.

Grass yield for the 5^ week interval  was slightly  lower than that for 
either  the 7 or 9 week intervals.
As indicated  by pH, the silages  were all well preserved.  There were 
only slight differences  in the dry matter  contents  of the silages. Crude  
protein  content  decreased  and crude fibre content  increased  as the inter ­
val between  cuts increased.
The chemical  composition  of the silages  is presented  in Table 2.
In 1973, the silages  were offered  ad lib. to 84 Hereford  cross suckled 
calves (mean initial liveweight  5.6 cwt) either with or without  4.4 lb 
barley. However,  animals  at this stage are still growing  and it was 
decided  that the barley  treatment  be replaced  with more mature  animals.  
Thus, in 1974, 42 Hereford-cross,  suckled  calves  (mean  initial liveweight 
4.7 cwt) and 42 Hereford-cross  stores  (mean  initial  liveweight  7 cwt) were  
offered  the silages,  with no barley.

The silage dry matter  intakes  are presented  in Table 3.
The dry matter  intake (DMI)  of silage by suckled  calves offered  no
barley  was similar  for all types  of silage. When  barley  wasoffered,  silage
DMI was slightly  reduced. The silage DMI of store cattle was higher
than that for suckled  calves  and there was a tendency  for intake to in-
crease  as the interval  between  cuts was reduced.
The animals  were weighed  twice weekly  and the daily live-weight  gains
are presented in Table 4.

In both 1973 and 1974,  the live-weight  gain of suckled  calves  on silage  
alone increased  due to early and more frequent  cutting.  Supplementation  
with barley  increased  live-weight  gain, the effect being less marked  with 
high quality,  5^ week silage.
The live-weight  gain of store cattle increased  as the interval  between  
cuts decreased  from 9 weeks  to 7 weeks. The daily gains from 54 and 7 
week silage were identical.
After approximately  15 weeks  on silage alone,  24 store animals  were 
slaughtered.  Carcase  weights  and kill-out  percentages  are presented  in 
Table 5.

Carcase  weight  was higher for 54 week than for 9 week silage and

In terms of feed conversion  (Table  6) the results  show that with high 
quality  silage less feed is required  per pound of live-weight  gain than 
with poor quality  silage. Supplementation  also reduced  the feed require ­
ment per pound LWG, the reduction  being greatest  with low quality  
silage.

As indicated  by pH, the silages  were well preserved.  The silage dry 
matter and crude fibre contents  increased  and crude protein content  
decreased  as the interval  between  cuts increased.
The silages  were offered  ad lib. with either 0, 2.2 or 4.4 Ib/day  of 
barley  to Hereford-cross  suckled  calves  (mean  initial liveweight  6.1 cwt) 
and silage dry matter  intakes  are presented  in Table 9.

The DMI of silage was lower for 9 and 12 week silage than that for 6 
week silage. The DMI of silage was reduced  by supplementation,  the 
reduction  being greater  for 6 week silage than for 9 and 12 week silage.
The animals  were weighed  twice weekly  and daily gains are presented

As in Experiment  1, liveweight  gain increased  as a result of earlier  
and more frequent  cutting. Supplementation  increased  daily gains, the 
effect being  more marked  in the case of the low quality,  12 week silage.

The feed requirement  per pound  of gain was lower  for high quality,  6 
week silage than for low quality, 12 week silage. As in Experiment  1, 
supplementation  reduced  feed conversion  ratio, the effect being most  
marked  for 12 week silage.
Silage  digestibility
It is well known  that the digestibility  of silage  declines  as grass  matures,  
the rate of decline  being highest  in the latter half of May and the first 
half of June. The effect of earlier  and more frequent  cutting  on silage  
digestibility  can be seen in the results  given in Table 12.
The extent of the relationship  between  silage digestibility  and live- 
weight  gain is obvious  from research  work in An Foras  Taluntais  (Table 
13).
It is clear, therefore,  that earlier  and more frequent  cutting  increased 
the digestibility  of silage and as a consequence,  daily liveweight  gain, 
carcase  gain and feed conversion  ratio of beef catt ’e were improved.  Sup­
plementation  with barley increased  daily gain and reduced  feed conver ­
sion ratio.

Red clover  silage
Recently  there has been a renewed  interest  in the us of red clover  for 
silage. The increasing  cost of fertilizer  nitrogen,  coupled  with the devel ­
opment  of new disease  resistant,  tetraploid  varieties,  capable  of producing  
high yields of forage with a high protein  content  has stimulated  this 
interest. Research  work has shown  that high levels of animal  perform ­
ance can be achieved  from red clover silage. However,  red clover  has 
several  disadvantages.  The crop is difficult  to establish  and due to its 
erect type of growth  is more suited to silage than to grazing.  Due to the 
low dry matter  content  and the high protein  - low sugar content  the crop 
is difficult  to ensile successfully.  The use of the crop is restricted  to beef 
animals  since red clover  contains  oestrogenic  compounds  which  are likely 
to reduce  fertility  of breeding  animals.  Experiments  in Scotland  (Frame,  
Harkness  and Hunt, 1976) have shown  that the DM yie’d of red clover  
is normally  slightly  lower than that expected  from good grass swards  
receiving  high levels of nitrogen.  Dry matter  yie'd and crude protein  
content  is presented  in Table 14.
At Hillsborough,  the feeding  value of red clover silage has been 
investigated.  Red clover  (variety  Hungaropoly)  was ensiled  in September.  
The crop was wilted  or 24 h and formic  acid was applied  as an additive  
at the rate of J gallon/ton.  The red clover silage was compared  with

composition  and dry matter  digestibility  of the silages  are given in Table  
15. The grass silage  was of low quality  as indicated  by the low dry matter  
digestibility.

The DMI of red clover  silage was higher  than that from grass silage.  
Supplementation  of grass silage reduced  silage intake. Daily live-weight 
gain was highest  from red clover silage and lowest from grass silage  
offered  alone.
Conclusions
Finally,  to enable  an optimum  level of beef output  from silage to be 
determined,  the results have been related to production  on a per acre 
basis. In such an exercise,  certain  assumptions  must be made. The yield  
of edible silage may be calculated  from grass DM yields if a 20% dry 
matter  loss from the silo is assumed.  An average  yield of barley  of 35 
cwt/acre  has also been assumed.
From the results,  the output  of beef per acre from each system  can be 
calculated,  bearing  in mind that ‘per acre ’ takes into account  the acreage  
required  to produce  any barley  offered  to the cattle. The potential  beef 
production  from the various  systems  is presented  in Table 17.

In Experiment  1, the highest  LWG per acre was produced  from silage  
cut at 5^ week intervals  and offered  to suckled  calves. In other words,  
for the smaller  animals,  5| week silage with no barley was the most  
efficient  system  on a per acre basis resulting  in the maximum  beef output  
per acre. For store animals,  the maximum  output  of beef was obtained  
from 7 week silage. In practical  terms,  however,  optimum  output  from  
either  suckled  calves  or store animals  would probably  be from silage cut 
at 7 week intervals.  Although  LWG was almost  doubled  when barley  
was offered,  the extra acreage  required  to produce  the barley,  reduced  
the output  of beef per acre to a level which  was well below  the optimum.  
However,  in order to finish a 5-6 cwt suckled  calf indoors  during  the 
winter,  a level of output  which is below the optimum  may have to be 
accepted.
23
In Experiment  2, the maximum  output  of beef per acre was obtained  
from silage  cut at 6 week intervals.  Supplementation  with barley  increased  
the total output  per acre, the effect being most marked  with low quality  
silage.
The actual outputs  from the two experiments  do not appear  to cor­
respond,  but the trends  in output per acre resulting  from earlier and 
more frequent  cutting  are identical.
The output  of beef from red clover  silage can also be calculated  and 
the results  are presented  in Table 18.

Grass silage 6.1
Grass silage + 5.5 lb barley 6.5
Silage made from red clover produced  a greater  output  of beef per 
acre than grass silage or grass silage and barley.
In conclusion,  successful  winter  fattening  depends  on three factors  : 
purchase  price, sa'e returns  and feed costs. Beef farmers  make great  
efforts  to ensure  that the lowest  purchase  and the highest  selling prices 
are obtained.  Feed costs,  however,  are often ignored.  In U.K.,  Meat and 
Livestock  Commission  recordings  (1976) on beef fattening  units have 
shown that the most efficient  units have lower feed costs/lb  of gain, 
mainly  due to higher rates of gain and less dependence  on expensive  
purchased  concentrate.  The production  of high quality  silage,  combined 
with a reduction  in the quantity  of concentrate  in the ration to produce 
the optimum  beef output  per acre, can reduce  feed costs per lb of gain.

Feeding  Supplements  with Silage to 
Fattening  Cattle
M. DRENNAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Co. Meath.
The economics  of feeding  supplements  with silage to fattening  cattle is 
of immediate  interest  and this paper  is concerned  with, firstly,  how much 
barley  should  be fed and, secondly,  the role of alternative  crops such as 
fodder  beets.
Where  fattening  cattle are fed conserved  grass over the winter  period,  
the major  factors  determining  the level of concentrate  supplement  are ;
1. The extra weight  produced  from concentrate  feeding.
2. The extra cattle carried  as a result  of concentrate  feeding.
3. The autumn/spring  cattle price change.
4. The price of concentrates.
The data presented  here are the average  results obtained  from 18 
experiments  at Grange  in which  cattle were fed grass silage alone or with 
different  levels of supplementary  barley. The levels of barley  fed varied  
from 3 to 10 lb per animal  daily and from these the responses  from 
feeding  4 or 8 lb per day were calculated.
Extra  weight  produced  from barley  feeding
The average  daily liveweight  gain of animals  fed silage alone or with 
4 or 8 lb barley  daily were 1.25, 1.83 and 2.09 lb respectively.  A daily  
liveweight  gain of 1.25 lb when fed silage only demonstrates  that moder ­
ate to high quality  silages  were used in these studies. When calculated  
over a 140-day  feeding  period,  animals  fed silage plus 4 and 8 lb barley  
daily gained 80 and 117 lb more liveweight  than those fed silage only 
(Table 1).
The corresponding  figures  for extra carcass  were 51 and 79 lb. There ­
fore 10.9 and 14.1 lb of barley were required  to produce  1 lb of extra

carcass  when 4 and 8 lb were fed respectively.  A good response  was 
obtained  from feeding  the first 4 lb barley but increasing  the level of 
supplementation  from 4 to 8 lb daily only increased  earcass  gain by 28 
lb over a 140-day  feeding  period  or 20 lb barley  was required  per lb of 
extra earcass  (Table  2).

Effect  of barley  feeding  on silage  intakes
Feed ing 4 lb barley  daily depressed  intakes  of silage by 10 per cent

Financial  returns  from barley  feeding
From these results,  the financial  returns  were ealculated  for a farm  
situation  involving  a winter  feeding  period  of 140 days where 300 tonnes  
silage (17.0 per cent dry matter)  is available.  The number  of cattle whieh  
can be carried  for 140 days is 50, 56 and 61 where  0, 4 and 8 lb barley  
is fed respectively.  The average  initial  liveweight  of the animals  used in 
in the above studies  was 884 lb and following  a 140-day  feeding  period,  
the final liveweights  (mart weight)  are 1031, 1111 and 1148 lb for those  
fed 0, 4 and 8 lb barley  respectively  (Table  4). The corresponding  figures  
for carcass  weights  are 535, 586 and 614 lb.
In order to place the returns  to barley  feeding  in their proper  perspec ­
tive, the returns  from feeding  silage alone are shown in Table 5. The 
extra returns  obtained  from feeding  4 and 8 lb of barley  daily with silage  
are shown  in Table 6.

As used in Table 5 return  is taken  to mean the difference  between  the 
sale price of animals  and cost of animals,  housing,  dosing,  etc. including 
the interest  on money  invested  in these items where  this is applicable.  A 
charge  for labour  is not included  in the costs. The extra returns  from 
meal feeding  (Table 6) is the difference  between  the returns  obtained  
when barley  is fed and that obtained  when silage alone is fed. No charge 
is made for additional  housing  where  extra cattle are carried  as a result 
of meal feeding,  because  it is assumed  that adequate  housing  is available.
The following  points  arise from Table 5 and 6.
1. When silage only was fed, a winter  cattle price increase  of about £3 
per cwt was necessary  to break  even when all costs were charged  with 
the exception  of labour. The price increase  required  to break even 
would be greater  at lower levels of production.
Having  covered  costs, a further  £3 per cwt cattle price increase  im­
proves  the returns  from feeding  the 300 tonnes  silage (produce  of 20 
acres cut twice) by £1,405 when silage alone is fed. Therefore,  the 
price increase  of cattle per cwt over the winter  is the major factor  
determining  returns  from winter  feeding.
The average  killing-out  percentages  were 50.5, 51.4 and 52.2 for those  
fed 0, 4 and 8 lb barley  respectively.  Therefore,  the economic  returns  
from barley  feeding  are higher  where the animals  are sold in carcass  
form rather  than live at a similar  price per cwt. Thus, in calculating  
the extra returns  from barley  feeding  allowance  is made  for the higher 
killing-out  percentage  of the barley  fed groups.
When rolled barley  is charged  at £85 per tonne,  feeding  4 lb barley  
daily with silage improved  returns  in all circumstances.
Examination  of the extra returns  from feeding  barley with silage  
shows  that where there is no increase  in the price per cwt for beef 
over the winter  period the economic  level of barley feeding  is 4 lb 
daily. However,  with a price increase  of £6 per cwt in winter  feeding  
8 lb barley  gives better  returns  than feeding  4 lb daily.
As the sale price increases  relative  to the purchase  price, the econ ­
omics  of meal feeding  improve.2.

Effect  of barley  price on returns
In the above  calculations,  rolled barley  was charged  at £85 per tonne. 
The effect  of increasing  the cost of barley  by £10 or £20 per tonne  on the 
extra returns  from feeding  barley with silage (300 tonnes)  is shown in 
Table  7. Increasing  the cost of barley  by £10 per tonne reduces  returns  by 
£141 and £313 when 4 and 8 lb are fed daily respectively.  Thus  the cost of 
barley becomes  increasingly  important  as the level of barley feeding 
increases.
Variations  in responses  to supplements
In the above experiments,  large variations  were obtained  in responses 
to similar  levels of barley feeding. While it is generally  accepted  that 
better responses  can be expected  with poor rather than good quality

silages,  this was not very clear-cut  from the above  experiments.  However,  
one consistent  finding  was that a good response  in animal  performance  
was always  obtained  when the effect of supplementation  on silage was 
small. Likewise,  when  the depression  in silage intake  at a particular  level 
of barley  feeding  was large, a poor animal  response  was obtained  from 
the supplement.  As increased  carrying  capacity  is such an important  
factor  in the economics  of feeding  supplements,  the general  belief that a 
higher  barley  feeding  level can be used to overcome  the disadvantages  of 
poor quality  silage is not true.
Pelleted  dried grass  as a supplement  to silage
In two expteriments,  pelleted  dried grass was compared  with barley  as 
a supplement  to grass silage. In each experiment,  the silage was well 
preserved  (pH 3.9) and of high dry matter  digestibility  (69 per cent). The 
pelleted  dried grass was also of high quality  (dry matter  digestibility  of 
75.5% and 75.0% in Experiments  1 and 2 respectively).  The feeding  
periods  lasted for 98 and 112 days in Experiments  1 and 2 respectively  
during which silage was fed to appetite.  The treatments  were (1) no 
supplement,  (2) 3.3 lb dried grass, (3) 6.6 lb dried grass, (4) 9.9 lb dried  
grass, (5) 3.3 lb barley  and (6) 6.6 lb barley  per animal  daily. The com­
bined results  for the two experiments  are presented  in Table 8. At each 
level of supplementation,  liveweight  and carcass  weight  gain for animals  
fed dried grass and barley  were similar. Feeding  3.3, 6.6 and 9.9 lb of 
supplement  decreased  daily silage intakes  by 12, 18 and 24 per cent 
respectively  but there was no difference  between  the two supplements.  
On the basis of these experiments,  it appears  that dried grass as a sup­
plement  to silage can be substituted  for barley  on the basis of digestible  
organic  matter. However,  because  of the high crude protein  content  of 
dried grass compared  to barley,  it is most useful  in diets where  additional  
protein  is required.
Fodder  beet roots as a supplement  to silage
High dry matter  yields  per acre make monogerm  continental  varieties  
of fodder  beet attractive  as a winter  feed for cattle. In four experiments,

pulped  fodder  beet roots (variety  Monorosa)  were evaluated  as a supple ­
ment to grass  silage  for fattening  cattle. The chemical  composition  of the 
fodder  beet roots and silages  used are given in Tables  9 and 10. The 
fodder  beet roots had a dry matter  content  of approximately  20 per cent, 
were of high digestibility  (DMD  = 86%) but tended  to be low in crude  
protein  (approximately  7%). In general,  clay contamination  amounted  
to approximately  5 per cent as indicated  by the silica content.  The sil­
ages used were in general  of high digestibility  and were properly  pre­
served.

In Table 11, a summary  of the results  is shown  and the feeding  periods  
ranged from 122 to 142 days. Daily liveweight  gains of animals  fed 
silage alone was 1.0 lb in Experiments  1, 2 and 4 and 1.8 in Experiment  
3. In Experiments  1, 2 and 3, 5.5 lb of supplementary  barley  was fed 
daily per animal  and in Experiment  4, 11.0 lb barley was given. A 
similar  quantity  of supplementary  dry matter  was fed to other treatment  
groups  either  as fodder  beet alone or as fodder  beet/ soyobean  meal. The

amount  of soyabean  meal fed daily per animal  varied  from 0.75 lb (Expt.  
2) to 1.5 lb (Expt. 4). The results show that with the exception  of 
Experiment  3, the extra carcass produced  from supplementation  was 
lower  when fodder  roots alone were fed than when barley  was fed. How ­
ever, inclusion  of soyabean  with the fodder beet gave responses  quite  
similar  to that obtained  from barley. In Experiment  3, animal  perform ­
ance on silajge alone was excellent  and the responses  to all supplements  
was poor with no difference  between  supplements.  The figures  for feed 
intakes  (Table 12) show that the depression  in silage intakes  from similar  
quantities  of supplementary  fodder  beet and barley  were the same.
In conclusion,  fodder beet roots can be a satisfactory  alternative  to 
cereajs  as a supplement  to silage  for fattening  cattle. Because  of the low 
protein  content  of the roots, additional  protein  may be required  par­
ticularly  when the silage is low in protein  or roots  form a high proportion  
of the total diet. This can be overcome  however,  by ensuring  that the 
grass for silage is cut at a leafy stage when protein  content  is higher  and 
by using other supplements  of high protein  content  such as high quality  
dried grass.
Future  of fodder  beef as a winter  feed
Hay or silage have been regarded  as our main and, in many  cases,  our 
only source  of winter  feed for cattle. Because  of the high proportion  of 
land devoted  to permanent  pastures,  conserved  grass will continue  to be 
our major  winter  feed source.  While  dry matter  production  per acre from

grass is good,  this in itself is not sufficient  for the future. In most situa ­
tions, the limiting  factor is land, and beef producers  will have to think  
more in terms of beef production  per acre rather than just feed dry 
matter  production.  However,  when fodder  beet, barley  and grass silage  
are considered  in the context  of production  per acre, the high yields of 
good quality  material  obtained  from fodder  beet makes  it attractive  as a 
winter  feed. Dry matter  yields  of fodder  beet (variety  Monrosa)  obtained  
in four Institute  centres  in recent years show that about five tonnes  of 
roots and two tonnes  of tops per acre can be expected.  Useable  yields  of 
dry matter  and metabolizable  energy  per acre are higher  for fodder  beet 
compared  with barley  and grass  silage  (Table  13). The calculations  shown

in Table 14 demonstrate  that the higher  yield of fodder  beet per acre 
offsets higher production  costs compared  with barley and grass silage, 
resulting  in small differences  between  the three crops in production  costs 
per unit of feed energy. Because  of the low proportion  of tillage in the 
country  the scope for fodder  beet as a major source of feed is limited. 
However,  it merits  very serious  consideration  as part of the rotation  on 
cattle/tillage  farms.

The Performance  of Beef Crosses  
from the Daird Herd
F. J. HARTE
The Agricultural  Institute.  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
The Irish cattle popu'ation  has a different  structure  to that of other  
European  countries : firstly, the proportion  of beef to dairy cows is 
greater,  and secondly,  the extent  to which beef bulls are used on dairy  
cows is higher  than elsewhere  in Europe* ’'. Approximately  one-third  of 
the national  cow herd are single sucklers  and it is estimated  that of the 
dairy cows in the country,  64% are Friesian  or Friesian  type. It is likely 
that the change  from a mainly  Shorthorn  national  herd of some years  
ago to an almost  complete  Friesian  herd will be complete  in another  few 
years. It is necessary  to breed over 50% of the dairy cows back to 
Friesian  in order  to provide  sufficient  replacements*"'.  Disease  eradication  
schemes  could result in even more replacements  being required.  Friesian  
steers  (and/or  bulls)  and culled  cows (particularly  with the trend towards  
high feeding  levels)  will therefore  remain  important  sources  of beef. If 
we use higher levels of feeding  than heretofore,  we can expect that 
Friesian  male progeny  are likely  to be increasingly  acceptable  in Europe.
Dairy cows which  are not required  for breeding  replacements  and the 
cows  of the national  suckler  herd are therefore  available  for beef crossing.
The greatest  opportunity  for using beef bulls occurs in the single  
suckling  herd. Systems  of single suckling  have been described**'.  It is 
now accepted  that decreasing  the level of nutrition  immediately  before  
calving  eases  any calving  problems  that might  occur. While  such reduced  
nutrition  is acceptable  in the suckler  cow herd, it is not acceptable  with 
dairy cows. Consequently,  the ease of calving  problem  is greater  in dairy  
than in beef herds.
What breed of bull, therefore,  are we likely  to cross on that portion  of 
the dairy herd whieh is not needed  to produce  replacements  ? Results  on 
the performance  of cross breds at Grange  are presented  in this paper. It 
is realized  that in dairying,  calving  difficulties  can over-ride  any advan ­
tage in performance  due to choice  of bull. Aspects  of calving  difficulties 
have been discussed  previously**'.
Liveweight  performance
The liveweight  performances  of the various  breeds  and crosses  com­
pared at Grange  are shown in Table 1, with particular  emphasis  on the 
performance  of the progeny  of the continental  breeds.
There is considerable  variation  between  these experiments.  More  
O’Ferrall and Cunningham* ’' combined  the results  on a relative  basis,  
together  with R. Fallon ’s data at Grange,  and these are presented  in 
Table 2.

The approximate  7% advantage  in growth  rate in favour  of Charolais  
crosses  is now accepted  and if animals  are killed at higher  weights  in the 
future, the advantage  in favour  of the continental  breeds is likely to 
increase.
Results  on the effects of rearing  animals  as bulls are summarised  in 
Table 3, for the breeds  now available.
These results  are the means  of experiments  at Grange  and should  not 
be taken as comparisons  between  breeds  and crosses.  They merely  show  
the effects of non-castration  on liveweight  performance.  In all breeds  
there is considerable  extra gain to be obtained  by non-castration.  Also, 
greater  liveweight  gain can be obtained  by non-castration  than by chang ­
ing breed.
Dressing-out  percentages
Dressing-out  is really only important  when the returns  are compared  
to what might  have been paid for the animal  alive. But as long as there 
is an alternative  live trade,  the relationship  between  dressing-out  percen ­
tage and the liveweight  is obviously  important.  If there is no live trade,  
as is more or less the case in pigs, then dressing-out  percentage  is of less

interest  to the producer.  Then,  factors  such as lean meat production  and 
efficiency  of feed conversion  become  more important.  Dressing-out  per­
centage  is very important  for factory  buyers  because  they buy most of 
their stock live. There, the relationship  between  the live prices is 
important,  as is of course  the yield of carcass  from a factory  efficiency  
point of view.
When animals  are killed at a constant  degree  of finish,  and this is not 
always easy to determine,  differences  between  breeds and crosses in 
dressing-out  percentages  are small, with a tendency  for the beef breeds  
to dress-out  better* ’>. Average  dressing  percentages  of ‘finished ’ breeds  
and crosses  are given in Table 4.

However,  when animals  were slaughtered  on an age basis, rather than 
on degree  of finish,  the faster  growing  animals  (unless  they are on a very 
high plane of nutrition)  had on average  the lowest  dressing-out  percen ­
tage. This is shown  in Table 5.
The figures  in Tables  4 and 5 should  only be considered  relative  to 
each other. The final slaughter  weight  was taken at the slaughter  house

immediately  before slaughter  (not the “farm ” weight)  hence the high 
dressing-out  percentages.  They also include  the kidney  and channel  fat 
in the weight  of carcass. These fats are now removed  at the slaughter  
house before the carcass  is weighed  and this has the effect of reducing  
dressing-out  percentages  by about percentage  units. (Kidney  and 
channel  fat weights  vary considerably  and can range from 2 to 5% of 
the hot carcass  weights).
Table 6 gives average  dressing-out  percentages  of Friesian  and Char ­
olais bulls and steers. It is interesting  to note that the Friesian  bulls and 
Charolais  steers which were almost  the same weight  at slaughter,  had 
similar  dressing-out  percentages.

"The animals  were slaughtered  at two years  of age. These are based on 
“farm ” weights  but the kidney  and channel  fat is included.  It is well 
known  that dressing-out  percentage  increases  with weight  and particularly  
with degree  of finish. Consequently,  bulls can be expected  to dress-out  
better than comparably  fed steers simply because  they are heavier  at 
slaughter.
Carcass  composition
Carcasses  consist  of three components —bone,  fat and lean meat. The 
latter  is the valuable  component.  The average  price of lean at the factory  
is 24 times the price of bone and six times the price of fat. Thus, the
40
amount  of lean in the carcass  is the important  criterion.  Breeds,  and in 
particular  the stage at which they are slaughtered,  influence  carcass  
composition.  Experiments  at Grange  have shown that there are large 
differences  of lean and fat in the different  breeds. Results  are given in 
Table 7.

^ The animals  were slaughtered  when they were considered  to be 
‘finished ’ and the lean meat is defined  as everything  other than fat and 
bone. The figures  should  therefore  be considered  relative  to each other.
The average  composition  of Friesian,  Charolais  and Simmental  crosses 
IS given inTable  8. The method  of carcass  dissections  reported  in Table  
8 was similar  to that carried  out at the factory. The carcass  weights 
however  cannot  be directly  compared  because  the results  are frem two 
different  experiments.

The effect  of leaving  the animal  entire  on carcass  composition  is shown 
in Table 9.
It is clear that the effect of non-castration  decreases  fat content  and 
increases  lean content  very considerably.  The effects  of non-castration  
have been presented  to this Association  previously  and publishedf*- *’).

For increased  growth  rate, growth  promoters  have also shown  poten- 
tiaH'°l towards  efficiency  in beef production.
On the question  of carcass  shape, no significant  relationship  between 
yield of high priced  cuts and shape have been observed.  However,  there  
is likely to be a relationship  between  shape (or conformation)  and lean 
to bone ratio in the carcass.
The ability  of the continental  crosses  to produce  lean meat is extremely 
important.  Because  of the faster growth rate and leaner carcasses  at 
heavier  weights,  the extra yield of lean can be very significant.  This is 
clear from Table 10, where the yield of lean meat is expressed  in 
absolute  terms.  In these calculations  the following  assumptions  are made:
1. A Friesian  carcass  weight of 280 kg — readily  achievable  from a 
Friesian  steer out of the two year old beef system* ”*.
2. The Charolais  steer is 7% heavier  than the Friesian  steer.
3. Leaving  the animals  as bulls increases  weights  by 10%.
4. From various  experiments,  on average  a Friesian  steer carcass  con­
tains 66% lean and a Charolais  cross steer 68%.
5. Friesian  and Charolais  cross  bull carcasses  contain  on average  71 and 
74% lean respectively.
A price of 150p/kg  of lean.meat  (approx.  68p/lb). 6.
Summary
The emphasis  is likely to be on lean meat in the future —as meat be­
comes  more expensive  fat cannot be afforded  because  it is too expensive  to 
produce  on the animal  and it is too expensive  to sell at a low price.  As the 
processing  industry  hopefully  develops,  fat will be unacceuptable  at the 
factory. The data in Table 10 emphasize  the ability  of the continental  
breeds  compared  to the traditional  beef breeds  to produce  lean meat. It is 
likely that cattle will be killed at heavier  weights  in the future (as is at 
present  the case in France)  in order  to spread  high calf prices  over bigger 
carcasses  and also because  of high killing  and processing  costs. Thus,  there  
will be future  emphasis  on the use of continental  beef crosses.  The calving 
problem  is, however,  impeding  the greater  use of these larger  breeds  on 
the dairy herd. Finally,  experimental  results  at Grange  have been derived

froin  Gas to Grass
There's  more in the sea than just fish.
It's the age of offshore  energy  which  for 
other  countries  has already  become  a 
reality.
For Ireland  it will start in 1978 at Marino

use of Irish Natural  Gas as a feedstock  for 
the new Ammonia  and Urea plants.
This petrochemical  development  will put 
NET into the league  of r^^aJor  inter­

Insh agriculture,  our most  important  
industry  will benefit  through  the

It's a long way from gas to grass  but at

Introduction
The Irish cattle production  industry  is based on a large number  of small 
production  units. Table 1 shows  that in December  1975 the average  herd 
size was 27 cattle (of all classes).  The national  beef cow herd accounts  
for at least 30% of total cows and consequently  is responsible  for 30% 
of total beef production.  It too is based on small herds,  the average  being 
six beef cows. Table 1 shows  that 50% of the total cattle population  in 
December  1975 was wintered  in herds containing  fewer than 46 cattle  
(all classes),  and this proportion  is spread  ov^r 84% of farm holdings  
having cattle. Likewise  85% of the holdings  having beef cows were  
responsible  for 50% of the beef cow population  in herds  of nine or fewer  
cows. (Our dairy industry  is also based on small units; average  dairy  
cow herd size is 10 cows, with 50% of all dairy cows in herds of 22 or 
less).
Thus the farms on which at least half of the animals  which provide 
our beef industry  are very small units. This fact has important  implica ­
tions for the short term expansion  and development  of the industry.

The cattle production  industry  contains  considerable  division  of labour  
and considerable  trading in cattle at production  stages intermediate  
between  calf and beef. The industry  is dominated  by calf to weanling  
or store systems,  weanling  to store, and store to beef systems  with very 
few farms specialising  in integrated  calf to beef systems.  This extensive 
approach  to beef production  is reflected  in the age structure  of the
45
national  cattle herd. Eighty  per cent of the annual  male calf crop survives  
in the herd as animals  between  two and three years old and 17% of the 
crop survives  to over three years old. These figures  illustrate  the very 
considerable  potential  which exists for the application  of more intensive  
feeding  systems.
Despite  the division  of labour  between  different  sections  of the industry  
there is remarkably  little real specialisation  except  on the farms produc ­
ing beef in Winter/Spring/early  Summer  from Autumn/Winter  purchased  
stores. Costs in this system  are high but it is based chiefly  on the expec ­
tation that the Spring/Autumn  price per kg for beef will be considerably  
higher than the Autumn  per kg purchase  price. Jt appears  that this is 
the only sector of the present  cattle industry  which has made a major  
fixed capital  commitment  to beef production.
This system  cannot  profitably  be expanded  indefinitely.
Gross  margins  in beef systems  at Ballinalack
Systems  which have attracted  capital investment  in cattle have been 
determined  by the fact that financial  rewards  from cattle production  
do not always  accrue to efficiency  in cattle production.  This may be 
illustrated  by figures  from two farm units operated  by the Agricultural  
Institute  at Ballinalack,  Co. Westmeath.  Output  from these systems  is 
shown  in Table 2.
One of the units was a store to beef system producing  beef from 
animals  purchased  at 400 - 450 kg stores in Autumn  and sold as stores 
or beef in April/June.  The other  was a weanling  to beef system  producing  
two year old beef in Spring from weanlings  purchased  in October-  
November.

The store to beef system  always  yielded  a higher  gross margin  than 
the two-year-old  system despite  the fact that liveweight  gain per acre 
was always considerably  higher for the latter. Such systems have 
attracted  most of the capital  invested  in pattle production  and this invest ­
46
ment has been based on expected  seasonal  price changes.  The contribu ­
tion of the seasonal  price change  to gross margin  in the Ballinalack  store 
to beef system  averaged  £49.2 (or +54.5%  of total) for years 1972-75.  
The high replacement  cost of weanlings  in the weanling  to beef system  
in the same years  resulted  in the trading  element  of that system  increasing  
the gross margin  by £3.0 per acre (Table  2). However,  in three out of 
four years the trading  element  in this system  reduced  gross margin  by an 
average  £16 per acre (or —34.5% of total in these years).
Constraints  on Winter  beef system
Recent  increases  in the general  cattle price level, combined  with the 
currently  very high interest  rates,  pose serious  problems  for anybody  now 
commencing  to develop  an intensive  Winter/Spring  beef system. The 
high peak borrowing  for stock in itself poses  a problem  which  is seriously 
aggravated  by working  capital  interest  charges  of up to £20 per animal  
and housing  loan repalyments  of £15 per animal. In an intensive  Winter  
beef system  these two charges  alone can total over £100 per acre. Con­
sidering  the current  cost of feeding  as well as fixed and interest  charges  
it is now difficult  to make a modest  margin in a newly established  
intensive  wintering  system  with less than a £12-£14  per 100 kg differential  
between  Autumn  store price and Spring  beef price. The increased  volume 
of wintering  accommodation  provided  in the last few years and its con­
sequent  effect on demand  for stores in the Autumn,  combined  with the 
forecast  decline  in the supply  of stores  in the next two to three years,  will 
make such seasonal  price fluctuations  highly unlikely  in the next few 
years. It must be borne in mind also that the seasonality  in prime cattle  
slaughterings,  although  marked  (Table 3), is such that the pushing  for­
ward of 30,000 prime cattle from the fourth quarter  to the first and 
second  quarters  would alleviate  seasonal  variation.
Table 3

Quarter % of annual  prime  kill

April  - June 20.9
July - September 26.3
October • December 28.9
Taking  into account  the age structure  of the national  herd already  
referred  to, the feasibility  of achieving  such a shift in seasonality  of 
slaughtering  becomes  obvious.  This shift in turn, unless  countered  by a 
seasonal  change  in intervention  price,  will reduce  further  the likelihood  
of a sufficient  margin  to encourage  new investment  in intensive  wintering  
of cattle for the foreseeable  future.
47
In farm planning  the availability  of reasonable  estimates  of input costs  
and product  value is very important.  Recent  wide fluctuations  in calf 
prices  and in store cattle prices  make it practically  impossible  to plan a 
system suitable  for a cattle farm being developed  on borrowed  money 
and which yields a stable income  from buying  calves,  weanlings,  light 
stores  and selling  weanlings  or stores. These  fluctuations  combined  with 
the above constraints  on intensive  wintering,  when examined  from the 
point of view of planned  beef production,  dictate  that all new investment 
in cattle production  be directed  into establishing  integral  production  
enterprises.  These enterprises  are based on the rearing  and fattening  of 
calves  (or occasionally  weanlings)  to the beef stage on the one farm. This 
approach  to beef production  is already  well established  in all other  eight 
countries  in the E.E.C.  If our beef production  industry  is to be developed 
and expanded  to meet the opportunities  offered  by European  markets,  it 
must proceed  along these lines.
Two Year  Old Beef System
A system for producing  beef at two years of age from dairy herd 
calves has a major  role to play in transforming  a structured  but disor ­
ganised  industry  into a planned,  integrated  and efficient  industry.  The 
system  has been practiced  on farm units at Grange  and Ballinalack  by 
Dr. A. Conway,  Dr. J. Harte and Dr. D. Collins. It is also practiced  by 
Dr. P. Caffrey  on the University  College,  Dublin  farm at Celbridge.  This 
approach  to beef production  is now being implemented  on a number  of 
commercial  farms by the Advisory  Service  and is being actively  encour ­
aged by the chief lending  institutions  (Associated  Banks  and A.C.C.).
At Grange,  545 kg Friesian  cross steers yielding  293 kg carcases  have 
been produced  in the years 1971 to 1974. Initially,  the system  involved  
weanlings  purchased  in November.  This  weanling  to beef system  operated  
at a stocking  rate which produced  \\ finished  animals  per acre. The 
The weanling  to beef system  has been operated  also at Ballinalack  for 
four years at the same stocking  rate as in Grange.  Average  production  
figures  for the two locations  are shown  in Table  4.
Animal  performance  at Grange  has been such that very acceptable  beef 
and good carcase  weights  have been produced  at 24-25 months  of age. 
At Ballinalack  performance  has not been wholly satisfactory  due to 
excessively  high stocking  rate in relation  to the output  of the sward.  
Average  daily gain at grass has been 0.14 kg per day below the corres ­
ponding  Grange  figure of 0.82 kg per day. This reduction  accounts  for 
28 kg liveweight  gain or 14 kg of carcase  and it arises from excessive  
stocking  density  of three yearlings  per acre from April to mid August,  in 
relation  to pasture  production.  Grass was usually  scarce in the system  
from the end of the second  grazing  cycle (early June) onwards  resulting  
in a daily gain from turn-out  to mid August  of only 0.82 kg compared  
with the target figure of at least 0.9 kg per day). Another  manifestation  
of the high stocking  rate has been the early sale date forced by an 
inadequate  supply of silage. For every one day added to the second  
winter  feeding  period,  final carcase  weight  would  be increased  by about

0.5 kg. Hence,  there is opportunity  to improve  the Ballinalack  carcase  
weight  by at least 15 kg. These two effects  of reducing  the stocking  rate 
will raise carcase  weight  to the Grange  figure for Friesians  of 293 kg 
carcase.
The calf to beef system  is now being operated  at Ballinalack  at a 
stocking  rate which will produce  one finished  animal per 1.1 acres cf 
grass. The first batch of calves  bought  into the system  have achieved  the 
target  growth  rate and are being  finished  presently.
The conclusion  from the Ballinalack  trial is simply  that each develop ­
ing farm should  build up gradually  from present  stocking  rate towards  a 
stocking  rate giving an output  of one finished  animal  per acre per year 
but the optimum  stocking  rate appropriate  to each farm must be carefully  
recognised.  This is most important  in a developing  farm situation.

Second  winter 0.83 545 kg 24 months

The minimum  production  targets  for the system  are set out in Table  5. 
While 295 kg carcase  at two year old must be regarded  as the target  
carcase  weight  for the system,  it may be a little ambitious  in the first one 
to two years operation  of the system. For this reason  we set 281 kg car­
case as a readily attainable  budgetary  target in commercial  practice,  
using Friesian  cross calves from the dairy herd. These are minimum  
target  weights  which  are easily  achieved  and are readily  surpassed  where  
grass management  practice  and animal  husbandry  are good.
The winter  production  targets  of 0.53 and 0.83 kg per day for wean ­
lings and finishers  respectively  compare  with 0.1 - 0.3 kg per day on many 
store cattle farms  at present.  This difference  in winter  performance  and 
the grassland  management  practices  on which it is based  (i.e. the produc ­
tion of sufficient  high quality  silage) is the key to the achievement  of 
targets  set out for the two-year-old  beef system.
The feed inputs  and current  feed costs are shown  in Table  6. In terms  
of volume,  grass and conserved  grass are the major  feed inputs. The calf 
will be fed 25 kg milk replacer  and 75 kg calf pencils  in the period  from 
purchase  until two weeks  after turn-out  to grass. Towards  the end of the 
first grazing  season  the calf requires  1-1^ kg rolled barley per day in 
September/October  and when grass is scarce. Likewise,  2 kg barley  per 
day may be fed to the 1^ year old cattle under  similar  circumstances.
Table 6
Feed inputs  and feed costs  in two-year-old  beef system  (1976  values)
Feeds Unit cost Cost
25 kg milk replacer £440 tonne £11.00
75 kg calf pencils £1 20/tonne £ 9.00
525 kg barley £ 90/'tonne £48.00
8.5 t. silage £5.50/tonne £47.00
Grazing £15.00
Total Feed Cost per Animal £130.00
In Table 6 allowance  is made for feeding  j kg barley  per day during  
the weanlings  first winter. If silage is derived  from a six week ’s old 
growth  of grass and if quality  is good, barley  is not required.  The cost­
ings also allow for feeding  2^ kg barley  per day to the finishing  cattle in 
the second  winter. With good quality  silage this will produce  0.8 - 0.9 
kg liveweight  per day.
The grass management  programme  for the system  involves  rotational  
grazing  where possible  with the calves grazing  ahead of the yearlings,  
thereby  ensuring  high quality  material.  For every animal unit in the 
system  0.6 acres  should  be closed  in spring  for silage  to be cut about  20th 
May. A second  cut should  be taken from 0.4 - 0.6 acres (depending  on 
grass supply)  about 30th June. If required  a third cut should  be taken
50
off 0.3 acres about 12th August.  Minimum  silage production  must be 8^ 
tonnes (at 20% d.m.) per animal unit (weanling  and finisher)  in the 
enterprise.
Phosphate,  potash  and lime inputs  are indicated  by soil tests. Seventy  
five kg of CAN per acre is applied  to the grazing  area for early grass. 
One hundred  and fifty kg CAN  per acre is used for first and second  cuts 
of silage,  and 100 kg per acre is used for the third cut. Seventy  five kg 
are used for the first grazing  after silage. These inputs  may be reduced  
depKjnding  on the efficiency  with which  slurry is recycled  on each farm.
The calves  are given first preference  on the silage aftermath.  They are 
worm dosed before being transferred  to it. Slurry may be disposed  of 
mainly  on the silage area in January  (to relieve  pressure  on storage  space  
later on), after first and second  silage cuts and at the end of the grazing  
season.
The total budgeted  feed cost of £130 per animal  (Table  6) allows  for 
full recommended  inputs  of purchased  fertiliser  and allows  full current  
market  price for concentrate  inputs. With these inputs  an output  target  
of one finished  animal  per 1-1.1 acres good grassland  is the eventual  
objective.
Non-feed  costs include  rent and rates —£4, mortality —£5, interest  on 
working  capital —£30, veterinary/medicine —£4, transport —£3, miscel ­
laneous —£10,  and slatted  floor housing  at current  cost (after  grant)  using  
long term borrowed  money (£20), (assuming  some storage sheds and 
basic equipment  already  existing  on farm). These amount  to £76 to give 
a total production  cost of £206.
The predicted  price for beef is 121 p per kg carcase,  grossing  £340 per 
animal. If it is replaced  with a calf costing  £50, gross output  will be 
£290,  and net return  to land and labour  will be £84 per animal  (at present  
money  value). Every Ip increase  in realised  beef price above 121 p per 
kg will increase  the margin  by £2.80. More importantly,  any increase  in 
calf price above  £50 will reduce  income  by an equivalent  amount.  Ideally,  
average  calf price should be closely related  to the value of 50 kg of 
finished  beef. It is in the beef producers  own interest  to bear this in 
mind at all times.
Savings  in the costs outlined  will be possible.  Many farmers  will be 
able to achieve  some saving  in interest  on working  capital. Those with 
partly paid off buildings  will save part of the housing  cost. Those in a 
position  to purchase  and store barley  off the combine  can save a net £5 
per animal. Farms  with facilities  for the efficient  collection  and disposal  
of slurry  can save a net £5 - £10 per animal  on purchased  fertiliser  costed  
in Table 6. Achievement  of Grange  carcase  weight  of 293 kg will raise 
budgeted  income  by £14. These savings  add up to £10 - £67 per animal,  
making  a net return  to land and labour  of £94 - £151 per animal,  depend ­
ing on farm circumstances  and technical  achievement.
If there is difficulty  in achieving  the weanling  target  weight  the follow ­
ing factors  should  be closely  examined  :
1. Excessive  disease  due to bad ealf rearing  aecommodation.
2. Calf made dependent  on grass too early in life.
51
3. Poor grass management.
4. Inadequate  treatment  for worms  and/or  hoose.
5. Grass scarcity  in autumn.
Failure  to achieve  winter  performance  targets  will normally  be due to 
one or more of the following  :
1. Insufficient  winter  feed and/or  low quality  winter  feed.
2. Defective  yard management.
3. Wet/dirty  accommodation.
Normally  there will be no difficulty  with performance  during  the sec­
ond summer  at grass except  in cases where the stocking  rate is high in 
relation  to the output  of the sward.
An integrated  beef system  such as the two-year-old  beef system  out­
lined here is appropriate  to (1) store cattle producers  who require  higher 
and more stable incomes  from cattle; (2) farmers  embarking  on a beef 
farm development  project  and making  a major  capital  commitment  with 
borrowed  money.
Conclusion
The main advantages  of the integrated  system  approach  to beef pro­
duction  are :
1. A basis is provided  for the planned  development  of, and investment 
in, the beef production  industry.
2. It relates  financial  rewards  for beef production  to technical  efficiency.
3. It permits  stable  and reasonable  income  per animal.
4. There is commitment  in providing  sufficient  high quality  winter  feed 
for dry stock.
5. It eliminates  the store periods  in the beef animal ’s growth  and reduces  
slaughter  age with consequent  higher  quality  and greater  uniformity  
in the meat.
6. It saves unnecessary  transport  and marketing  charges.
7. A framework  for exploiting  lean breeds  and bulls for beef production  
is provided.

Calf supplies
The number  of cattle in any one year is normally  85% of the cow 
population,  the remainder  being accounted  for by barren  cows, stillborn  
calves  due to Brucellosis  and calf mortality.  It is therefore  estimated  that 
1.7 million  calves  were produced  from about two million  cows in 1976.  
These calves  have since entered  the beef production  pipeline  which will 
take them through  a number  of farms  and farming  systems  before  reach ­
ing slaughter  weight  in 1978.
Fig. 1 shows that 400,000  calves are required  as herd replacements.  
The remainder,  1.3 million  calves,  will be reared as prime beef cattle. 
Of these, 65% are males (845,000)  and 35% females.  The 1.3 million 
calves  for prime beef consist  of the following  breeds :
Friesian  \
Friesian  x Shorthorn  ^ 40%
Hereford  crosses 40%
Shorthorns  6%
Angus + Continental  crosses 7%
Other breeds  7%
There are only about 100,000  Continental  crosses  and many of these  
were sold as calves  to Europe.  Most of the female  calves  are reared  and 
fattened  for home consumption.  Thus, about 50% of the prime cattle 
population  is Friesian  and 50% consists  of British  breed crosses.  The latter  
are suitable  only for the British  trade. It is well known  that our Friesian  
cows are generally  small by Continental  standards  and it is unlikely  that 
the beef animals  produced  from these cows will be suitable  for the 
European  market.  It must be pointed  out however  that there is emphasis  
by the Department  of Agriculture  on maintaining  beef quality  in the 
bulls standing  at the A.I. stations.
It is concluded,  therefore,  that the greatest  proportion  of our cattle are 
suitable  for the British  trade only. By and large our cattle industry  has 
not adapted  to the Continental  market.
Financial  considerations  in winter  fattening
; There  is a strong  risk element  in winter  fattening  systems.  For example  
let us assume  a target  of 280 lb liveweight  gain (LWG)  for a store bullock  
weighing  8^ cwt and fed silage plus barley  over a winter  {period of 160 
days. Thus initial costs are :
Store bullock  @ £30/cwt  delivered  £255
Silage @ £6/ton  @ 20% D.M. = £30/ton  1.36p/lbD.M.
, Barley  @ £80/ton,  rolled at 10% moisture  3.63p/lbD.Mt '.-v  _ ' ' ■ . i
The animal  performance  target is an average  daily gain (ADG)  of 1.75 
lb. -Eet u'st assume  that the silage provides  for animal  maintenance  + 1 
lb ADG and that 0.75 lb ADG is obtained  from 8 lb barley  supplement.

Thus,  it is concluded  that :
1. For an investment  of about £33,000  in 100 cattle for six months  the 
return  at best at 58p/lb  is only 11%.
2. The profitability  of feeding  cattle depends  on the cost of the weight 
gain. Silage  quality  is therefore  of the utmost  importance.  There  can be 
little doubt  that if winter  feeding  of cattle is to remain  profitable  both 
quality  and yields  of silage must be improved.
Integration  of the cattle  industry
There is a risk element  in cattle feeding  with three main eeonomic 
factors  involved  :
(a) Purchase  price of store cattle.
(b) Cost and quality  of feed.
(c) Price  of finished  cattle.
The feeder has control  over only one of these factors,  namely,  cost of 
feeding.  Although  this cost can be reduced,  the other two factors  have a 
major influence.  In future,  feeders  will be reluctant  to invest money  at 
high risk unless there is a minimum  price guarantee  before store cattle  
are purchased.  If there is a price guarantee  and feed costs are known,  
feeders  will be much more discriminating  in the purchase  of store cattle.  
Only the efficient  feeders  will feed store cattle.
It is much more desirable  for the store producer  to finish  cattle himself 
and realise  the added value. Alternatively  the feeder  may buy cattle at 
an earlier  stage when investment  is much lower. This is common  practice 
in Europe  and the U.S.
Variation  in animal  performance
A major problem  in supplying  factory requirements  is the wide 
variation  in the performance  of store cattle in winter  fattening  systems.  
Variation  ranges  from a single suckled  fast growing  animal  to a fairly  
aged animal  which  has experienced  more than one store period  and has 
possibly  been fed on several  farms. There  is also breed variation.  Angus  
and Herefords  mature  at relatively  low weights,  whilst  Continental  breeds  
mature  at much higher  weights.
The feeder  must purchase  from what is available  on the market.  Since  
cattle are not sold individually  and are not of known  origin,  bought-in  
cattle are generally  variable.  Different  breeds  respond  differently  to any 
one diet. Despite care in selecting  animals  for finishing,  they have 
different  finishing  dates. Some animals  become  over-fat  while others  are 
not sufficiently  finished.

These figures  show that it is difficult  to meet factory  requirements  for 
a standard  product.
Competition  from the export  trade
Live cattle  exports  in 1975 numbered  695,000.  The majority  were store 
cattle  destined  for the U.K. These  are always  of high quality,  drawn  from 
the top 50% of store cattle presented  for sale here. British  buyers  pay 
higher  prices because  of subsidy  arrangements.  Therefore,  the selection 
of stores available  to Irish feeders  is restricted  in quality. This again  
leads to less than top animal  performance  in our winter  fattening  systems.
EEC price negotiations
These  negotiations  are usually  held in mid-March  and the intervention  
price for top beef is not known  until April. Several  disadvantages  arise 
from the timing  of this announcement :
1. Because  of the cost and limited  supply  of winter  feed, feeders  delay  
purchase  of cattle until late Autumn,  they then compete  with each other  
and store cattle prices  rise.
2. Supplies  to the factories  are delayed  in Spring  while feeders  await  the 
price rise.
3. Store  producers  are obliged  to hold cattle until late Autumn  because 
of the low demand  in August  and September.
More ordered  marketing  of cattle,  both by store producers  and feeders, 
would  emerge  if the Spring  price for beef could be announced  earlier. A 
price rise in January  would  promote  the supply  of cattle  to factories  in the 
early part of the year. Cattle would be placed  on finishing  diets much  
earlier,  before they lose weight  on grass in late Autumn.  The buying  
season  for stores  would be lengthened.  Feeders  would  have less over-fat  
cattle by not waiting  for a price rise. If an increase  of 4-5p is expected,
59
there is a substantial  effect on the supply  of cattle. Moreover,  feeders 
who would sell cattle in January  could replace.
Payment  for quality
One reason why feeders  cannot  compete  with U.K. and Continental  
buyers  is the absence  of any premium  on the finished  animal  when sold 
to the factory. This does not encourage  feeders  to purchase  the best 
animals.  In fact, many feeders  set a fixed purchase  price which  they will 
not exceed,  and cattle quality  is sacrificed.  There  is therefore  little incen ­
tive to breed better animals.  Factories  argue that every farmer  has a 
mixture  of cattle and that he will not accept  a price differential.  Because 
of M.C.A.  arrangements  and variation  in the price offered  for different  
cuts, factories  must frequently  change  markets  depending  on price. It is 
therefore  difficult  to establish  the standards  for which  a premium  should 
be paid. Despite  this it is well known  that animals  with better confor ­
mation  are worth  more money,  because  of the higher  carcass  yields  when 
boned out.
Meeting  factory  requirements  has been discussed  only from the winter  
feeders ’ point of view. Similar  problems  arise with cattle finished  on 
grass.
Conclusion
To achieve  the best prices  on the Continental  market.  Continental  bulls  
must be used on all breeding  animals  except  for replacement  stock and 
increases  in the dairy herd.
There must be improved  standards  of feeding  of all animals  from the 
calf stage so that they are finished  during  the most efficient  and fast 
growing  period up to two years of age. This would  give a quicker  turn­
over of cash invested  in livestock  and would ensure that animals  are 
finished  with a minimum  of fat. Independent  grading  of cattle  at factories  
and premium  payments  for quality  are required.  The only way to obtain  
high quality  is to pay for it.
There must be aggressive  marketing  by meat processing  industries  in 
order to get maximum  prices for Irish beef.

Calf Marketing
B. LAWSON
Staffordshire  Farmers  Ltd., Wolverhampton,  England.
Staffordshire  Farmers  Ltd. is an agricultural  Co-operative  with a turnover  
of £33,000,000  with coverage  across  the whole  of the Midlands.  The main  
business  of the Company  is in feeding  stuffs and fertilisers  with five 
specialists  divisions  within the Society  : livestock,  seeds, home grown 
grain,  potatoes  and fuel. The Livestock  Division  was established  fourteen  
years ago. Initially,  we were solely  concerned  with the marketing  of pigs 
for breeders  and feeders. The Division  has changed  since those early  
days of group  marketing  and the departmental  turnover  is now in excess 
of £3,000,000.  The Livestock  Division  has now extended  its activities  to 
the marketing  of all classes  of livestock.
Let us first of all decide  what is meant  by this. It means  providing  the 
customer  with what he requires,  when he requires  it. Unfortunately,  
marketing  often becomes  the means  of disposing  of an article  to its best 
advantage.  This will be explained  later.
Calf numbers
It will be useful to consider  some statistics  as a background  to this 
paper. During  1975 in England  and Wales  4.3 million  cows and heifers  
were put to the bull. Of these, 72% were for the primary  purpose  of 
milk production  and the remainder  were for the sole purpose  of produc ­
ing beef. Of the four million  plus calves produced  annually,  there is 
an estimated  mortality  rate of 5%. In addition,  530,000  calves are 
slaughtered  within  one month  of birth as they are not suitable  for rearing  
purposes.
During  that period  620,000  calves  were reared  for replacement  in the 
national  dairy and beef herds. An insignificant  percentage  of bull calves 
were reared  for breeding  purposes,  but a significant  and increasing  num ­
ber of calves  are being  exported  each year for rearing  in other European  
countries.  In 1975 this figure  was 105,000  but it is estimated  that this will 
be doubled  in 1976.
The remainder  are made available  for rearing  as beef. The self suffic ­
iency level of beef in England  and Wales  in 1975 was calculated  at 90% 
which suggests  that if the 530,000  calves  which  were either slaughtered  
or died from natural  causes  had been reared,  a situation  of maximum  
self sufficiency  would have prevailed.  This is of course  a simplification,  
but illustrates  the need to try to reduce  the wastage  of J million  calves 
per year. Finally,  there are approximately  25,000 calves reared in 
Specialised  Veal units each year.
63
Calf marketing
Calf marketing  is a process  of establishing  from the retail butcher  what  
he is most likely  to supply  to housewives,  and then relating  that observa ­
tion back via the various  stages of production  and management  to the 
cow.
Let us consider  how that can be achieved.  This is where  the benefi^  
of a producer  organisation  are invaluable.  Through  the management  staff 
of the Livestock  Division  we know from the slaughtering  wholesalers  
which  carcases  are in the greatest  demand  by their retail customers.  This 
information  is determined  by the housewife.  We are then able to relate  
that requirement  to the type of beef animal capable  of providing  a 
suitable  carcase. The financial  aspects  immediately  take care of them ­
selves,  since,  if the product  is in demand  by the customer  then the retailer  
can sell to his advantage.  Likewise,  the wholesaler  gets a similar  financial 
reward  from the retailer  and accepts  that the only means  of attracting  
suitable  cattle to his abattoir  is through  financial  incentive,  i.e. the price  
paid to the producer.
If it is financially  attractive  to the beef finisher,  then the calf producer  
should  reap the rewards  of a supply  and demand  situation.  So, having 
determined  the series of events  capable  of producing  success  how then 
does an organisation  like ours ensure  that these principles  are put into 
practice  ?
Field staff
Staffordshire  Farmers  is in the enviable  position  of having  very close  
links and loyalties  with its farmer  members.  However,  we are not tempted  
into complacency  by this situation,  since these links  will quickly  disappear  
if the management  staff are not capable  of carrying  out a successful  
marketing  operation.  Consequently  we have ensured  that efficient  and 
capable  staff are employed  and that suitable  re-training  schemes  are 
regularly  introduced  so that staff can keep pace with the industry  and 
its developments.
Regular  contact  with producers  by the Field Staff ensures  that the 
producer  is informed  of the market  requirements.  He is acquainted  wUh 
the demands  of the wholesaler  and he will make sure that Stafford.shire  
Farmers  supply  him with the correct  type of stock to meet that market  
demand  and so reap the financial  rewards.  Because  of this regular  contact  
with beef finishers,  the department  knows the requirements  of each 
member  in terms  of his supplies  of calves  or store cattle,  both in quality  
and quantity.  This information  is carefully  monitored  and related  baek  
to the dairy farmers  and suckler  herd owners  in the membership  with us. 
Again,  this liaison  ensures  that the management  knows  the number  of 
cows being  put to the bull at any one time. Therefore  the various  calving 
patterns  can be charted.  As a result the trends  of the meat industry  are 
reflected  back to the calf producer  as an indication  of the type of calves 
that are going to be in demand.  Unfortunately,  beeause  the agricultural  
product  market  is so changeable  and sensitive,  these simple principles
64
are aggravated  and disrupted  by other factors. The fact that over 70% 
of beef produced  in England  and Wales is a by product  of the dairy  
industry  means  that beef is not the first consideration.
The main considerations  are milk, and the continuing  efforts  of milk 
producers  to improve  yields and to provide  a supply of replacement  
females.  Consequently,  the beef industry  as such is not always  served  as 
well as it might be. However,  we have to live with this situation,  which 
is responsible  for the second part of my marketing  statement ; “that 
marketing  is the art of making  the best use of a product  produced  under  
other influences ”.
The Staffordshire  Farmers  system  of marketing  calves  is similar  to that 
of other marketing  groups  in England  and Wales. However,  disposal  of 
the majority  of calves produced  in these countries  continues  via the 
Auction  Market.
Although  this is an expensive  method,  with fluctuating  prices due to 
the vagaries  of a dealer controlled  market,  most farmers  continue  to 
support  it, since they believe  that it is simple  and convenient.  In these  
days of intense  competition  some farmers  believe  that it is not possible 
for our Co-operative  to give all round benefits.  Fortunately  we have a 
considerable  number  of members  who know differently.
Benefits  to producers  and buyers  of calves
Let us therefore  consider  our alternative.  A ’phone call notifies  the 
department  that a number  of calves  are available  for collection,  with all 
the problems  of price, a buyer and transport  settled by the department  
for the producer.  The obvious  benefits  in allowing  a better  presentation  
of the calf, reduced  stress and health hazard  to the calf highlight  the 
advantages.  The allied reduction  in marketing  costs  created  by improved  
efficiency  and reduced  overheads,  together  with a stable predetermined  
price system  results  in improved  net returns.
The benefits  to the buyer  are also considerable.  He also has the ad­
vantage  of reduced  stress and health hazard  to the calf. A 48 hour  
guarantee  against  ill health  or death resulting  from a condition  evident  
at the time of sale gives an added insurance  to the buyer. There is an 
understanding  that if he is dissatisfied  with one or more of the calves 
which  have been delivered  to him, he is at liberty  to leave that, or those,  
calves  on the lorry. The buyer ’s awareness  of the price prior to delivery  
of the calves  and knowledge  that because  of all the guarantees  by which 
he IS protected,  makes  him realise  that we make every effort to ensure  
satisfaction.  There are other advantages  : the time saved by the buyer  
in not attending  Auction  Markets  to buy calves;  the doubts  as to whether  
the type of calf which he requires  will be at the market  in suitable  
quantities  and at a satisfactory  price; his awareness  that the calves  have 
not been hawked  around  the various  markets  with resulting  journeys  of 
stress and discomfort;  knowledge  of the origin and breeding  of those 
calves. All these factors  render  the marketing  service that we provide  
attractive  to the buyer.
65
Providing  this type of service  is very exacting.  Instead  of much  of the 
responsibility  being left to the buyer in the traditional  auction  market,  
the service  places  an enormous  onus on Staffordshire  Farmers  livestock 
fieldsmen.  Providing  such a service  is consequently  not cheap;  cheapness  
however  usually  implies  inferior  quality.  The service  is competitive  and 
designed  to be of greatest  value to both buyer  and seller alike.
Breed  improvement
With increasing  attention  towards  improving  the marketing  and pro­
cessing  of beef, the progressive  producers  of finished  cattle are beginning  
to examine  means  of exerting  influence  over the production  of improved  
calves  for the specific  demands  of the meat industry.  Investigations  and 
research  are being undertaken  into improvement  programmes.  In the 
United  Kingdom  a system  of identifying  bulls of above  average  perform ­
ance is operated  by the Milk Marketing  Board  and other cattle breeding  
companies  at the various  insemination  centres. Within  the M.M.B.  this 
is widely  known  as the “Red Star” scheme.  Finished  beef producers  are 
prepared  to give financial  incentives  to dairy herd owners  to make use 
of such improved  sires which are identified  in all the beef breeds. The 
premium  and benefits  are not large but are enough  to attract  many  dairy  
farmers.  The finishers  know that this improved  production  will be evid­
ent in the carcase,  in particular  the amount  of saleable  meat that the 
butcher  can process  from such carcases.  The initial calf price prernium  
will be more than covered  by the returns  from an improved  yield. Yields 
of meat from beef carcases  vary from 65% to 77%. A difference  of 5% 
is common  and in an average  carcase  of 250 kilos this represents  a 
difference  of 12.5 kilograms  of meat which  at today ’s price amounts  to 
£8.90.
It is clear therefore  that our method  of marketing  is sophisticated.  The 
methods  outlined  are the future trends which are slowly beginning  to 
evolve  and in the next five years will assume  significant  status.
Calf export  market
The export  market  in calves has become  a larger factor in the calf 
industry  in the last 18 months.  In 1976 it is estimated  that over 200,000  
calves  were exported  from the United  Kingdom.  It is not in our longterm  
interests  to export  too many of our calves  to other European  countries.  
The tight specification  demanded  by these countries  results  in the best 
quality  calves being exported.  In the long term, it is in the interests  of 
the country  to retain calves  and feed them through  to finished  beef, at 
which  we are said to be the leaders  in the Community.  They are then 
more likely to be slaughtered  in our abattoirs  which,  because  of more 
stringent  health  and hygiene  regulations  and spiralling  costs of building  
materials,  plant and machinery,  are very heavily  capitalised  and must be 
maintained  at maximum  efficiency  and capacity.  We should  be studying 
the various  opportunities  of exporting  meat and meat products.  Thus,  
we can make the maximum  use of our best resources.
66
Nevertheless,  the attraction  of improved  market  prices available  for 
calves  of export  potential  will ensure  that whilst  conditions  permit  this 
trade will continue.  However,  the attractive  premiums  for export  calves 
cannot be acquired  without  considerable  effort. The specification  for 
calves  suitable  to meet the export  demand  both in terms  of quality  and 
health  standard  are difficult  to achieve.  For export  from the U.K. calves 
must be a minimum  of 50 kilos weight  at the time of arrival,  not at the 
time of removal  from the farm. They must undergo  rigorous  health  
checks  by Ministry  officials  and a compulsory  period  of rest and lairage  
prior to leaving  by sea or air. The paperwork  to accompany  them is 
considerable  and is checked,  double  checked,  signed and countersigned.  
Calculations  must be made in respect  of current  M.C.A. ’s (the levy sys­
tem interposed  by intra Community  trade in the form of monetary  
compensatory  amounts).  The export  market  requires  professional  exper ­
tise to ensure  its success  and continued  viability.
For this reason,  Staffordshire  Farmers  has joined  seven  other  marketing  
co-operatives  in the formation  of a marketing  federal known as Inter  
Group  Livestock  Limited,  constituted  for the purpose  of attending  to this 
specialist  export  market.  In its first year of operation  it was responsible  
for exporting  12,000  calves  and 400 dairy heifers.
Conclusion
Staffordshire  Farmers  is aware of the need to work closer  together  in 
an industry  renowned  for its traditional  independence.  Inter Group  Live ­
stock Limited  is an example  of this co-ordinated  effort.
The content  of this paper indicates  the intentions  of Staffordshire  
Farmers  to pursue  an aggressive  policy  towards  the improved  marketing  
of livestock  through  co-operatives.  It could be argued  that this aggressive  
attitude  has not always  existed  amongst  co-operatives  in general,  but we 
believe  that the next three years will show considerable  achievements  by 
the successful,  and only the successful,  marketing  co-operatives.  We have 
committed  ourselves  to this policy  and we are going  to make sure that it 
is successful.

Present  Standards  of Efficiency  in

M. BARLOW
Department  of Agriculture  and Fisheries.  Dublin.
During  the period 1972-1975  cattle farming  yielded  the lowest  income  of 
most lowland  enterprises  (Table 1). The technical  factors  of major im­
portance  are animal performance  and stocking  rate. These are vital 
elements  in the determination  of income  from cattle production  and an 
analysis  of these two factors in commercial  practice  is therefore  of 
interest.

Animal  performance
Irish catt'e are comparatively  old when they reach slaughter  weight. 
The June livestock  census  of the Central  Statistics  Office shows  that al­
most 20 per cent of cattle are over three years of age when sold for 
slaughter  or for export  as forward  stores.  Growth  curves  of (i) an average 
bullock  reared and finished  in traditional  fashion  and (ii) a bullock  
finished  in an integrated  calf to beef system  are shown  in Figure  1. It is 
clear that the growth  potential  of Irish cattle is not being  exploited.  The 
average  bullock  is over six months  older and is lighter  at finishing  than 
its contemporary  on a two year old system. This is a particularly  poor  
performance,  achieved  after three full seasons  at grass. In addition,  it 
requires  more than twice the amount  of land (1 acre v 2^ acres)  to finish  
the average  bullock  than in a fully integrated  calf to beef system. The 
nett effect of the poor animal  growth  rate and extensive  stocking  is to 
halve the income  that is obtainable  from a two year old system.

It is also clear from Figure 1 that the two winter periods  are the 
stages when animal performance  in the traditional  system is poorest,  
being  only 20 to 25 per cent of the performance  achieved  in the two year 
old system. Quality  and quantity  of winter  forage  are the most important  
factors  which affect this performance.
Quantity  of winter  foiage
Ample  supplies  of winter  forage are a pre-requisite  to efficient  cattle  
production.  It is apparent  from Table 2 that the national  winter  fodder  
supply  is inadequate,  it is therefore  not surprising  that the general  level 
of animal  performance  is poor. No allowance  has been made in these 
figures for winter grazing  and meal feeding. These are not likely to 
significantly  change  the picture.  The apparent  improvement  in 1975 was 
due to a fall in total livestock  numbers  rather  than any increase  in supply 
over demand.

Furthermore,  it appears  that there is wide variation  in winter  fodder  
supplies  between  regions  within the country,  with the greatest  deficits 
occurring  in western  areas. The general  deficit represents  about one 
million  hay equivalent  acres. Shortage  of winter  fodder  is a major  im­
pediment  to significant  national  improvement  in the technical  efficiency  
of cattle production.
Although  the amount  of silage made in the country  has been steadily  
increasing  over the past decade,  hay still accounts  for about  60 per cent 
of the national  winter  fodder  supply  (Figure  2). The task of making  a 
high quality  product  in the form of hay is substantially  more difficult 
than with silage under Irish climatic  conditions.  Consequently,  the rate 
of increase  in silage  conservation  must be accelerated.
Quality  of winter  forage
There is ample  evidence  to show that the average  quality  of hays and 
silages  is poor. Sample  analyses  carried  out by the Agricultural  Institute  
indicate  that the average  D.M.D.  of hay is 57 per cent while  that of silage  
is 61 per cent. Clearly,  these forages  are capable  of supporting  little 
more than animal  maintenance  and have no place in profitable  cattle  
production  today. Results  from the better commercial  farms recorded
Fig. 2. Quantities  of feed conserved  for winter
I
In 1975 hay accounted  for 62% and silage 38% of conserved  grass.
72
Agriculture  and Fisheries  show that the average  aM.D.  of silages is only 64-65 per cent — i.e. medium  quality  silage.  
These results  have been outlined  at previous  meetings  of the Association  
and It was shown  that animal  performance  was poor.
Last year (1975/76)  however,  there was substantial  improvement  in 
animal  ^rformance  on recorded  farms. The average  results  are given in 
I ab.es 3 and 4 with the corresponding  results  for the previous  winters  shown  for comparison.

There was a major improvement  in silage digestibility  in 1975/76.  
Average  cutting  date was 10 days earlier  and this is the likely reason  for 
the improved  digestibility.  The higher  average  dry matter  content  is a 
reflection  of the finer weather  in 1975 at cutting  time and there was a 
greater  proportion  of wilted silages  in that year. Silages  were generally  
well preserved  with no differences  between  years.
^ improvement  in animal  performance  in 1975/  
76 (Tab.e  4). The ADG from silage alone improved  by 100 per cent—
73
from 0.7 to 1.4 lb. This was associated  with the higher  digestibility  of 
the silage and with increased  dry matter  intake. The performance  from 
silage alone on the top third group  of farms was 1.7 lb ADG per day. 
This level of animal  performance  demonstrates  the real potential  of high 
quality  silage.
It is pertinent  at this point to examine  the effect of silage quality  on 
the feed costs of winter production.  Table 5 contains  detail of feed 
requirements  and cost of wintering  a 10 cwt bullock  for 130 days on
(i) high quality  silage capable  of producing  an ADG of H lb and (ii) a 
medium  quality  silage  requiring  supplementation  with 5 lb of meals  daily  
to achieve  the same ADG. The high quality  silage is cut before  June 1st 
and the medium  quality  two weeks  later.

Total feed costs (£) 35 53
The table shows  that it costs £18 less to winter  a 10 cwt bullock  on high 
quality  silage compared  with medium  quality  silage. It also shows  the 
relative  cost of high quality  silage  to meal. High quality  silage,  therefore,  
reduces  costs.
Many reasons  are advanced  for the rarity of high quality  silages  on 
cattle farms,  the commonest  being  :
(i) the failure  of the silage  contractor  to turn up on the date specified;
(ii) delays  due to bad weather;
(iii) the belief  that quantity  is more important  than quality.
It must be clearly  appreciated  that because  of the rapid recline  in grass 
digestibility  at the normal  silage cutting  stage, a two weeks delay in 
cutting  will change  the silage from a high to a medium  quality  product.  
To consistently  produce  a high quality  silage  from old permanent  pasture,  
the first cut must be taken  not later than May 31st and preferably  earlier.  
All subsequent  cuts must be taken after not more than seven weeks  re­
growth.
Some 60 per cent of the national  silage crop is cut by contractors.  
Contractors  play an important  role in silage making  and they require  a
74
certain  acreage  for cutting  to maintain  an attractive  income. This was 
achieved  in the past by having  a protracted  silage cutting season. It 
would appear  at the outset that the making  of high quality  silage with 
the contracting  system  is not feasible.  However,  this need not necessarily  
be so. Since there is a substantial  pay-off  from high quality  silage,  some  
of the pay-off  could be used as a premium  to contractors  who guarantee  
to have silage cut by a stipulated  date. This would promote  greater  
efficiency  among  contractors.  More farmers,  either as individuals  or as 
groups,  should plan to purchase  their own silage making  equipment.  
However,  before  taking  such action  they should  have clearly  established  
the feasibility  of making  high quality  silage in the new circumstances.  
There  are numerous  examples  of farmers  who have their own equipment  
and still fail to make high quality  silage.
Stocking  rate
The average  stocking  rate on the majority  of beef farms is low. A 
common  stocking  rate for summer  grazing  in traditional  practice  is the 
equivalent  of one 8 cwt bullock  per acre producing  about 4 cwts of 
liveweight.  Stocking  rate is the major determinant  of output  per acre. 
In order to examine  animal performance  and the effect of increased  
stocking  rate it was decided  in 1974 to set up a series of catt-e stocking 
rate demonstrations.  Three stocking  rates were chosen,  i.e. 18, 15 and 
12 cwts of liveweight  per acre at the start of grazing;  all stocking  rates  
were reduced  to a common  level (13 to 14 cwts/acre)  at mid season, 
about mid-July.  Each of the three stocking  rates were run on the same  
farm each year and every effort was made to ensure  equality  of swards  
between  treatments  within  farms. The mean date of initial grazing  was 
April 17th while the mean finishing  date was October  7th. A summary  
of the results  is presented  in Table 6.
Table 6

Total gain per acre, cwts 5.9 7.5 8.1
Total gain per animal,  lb 360 375 350Nitrogen/acre,  lb 100 110 130
Individual  animal  performance  was not affected  by the stocking  rate 
chosen,  while output  of liveweight  per acre was increased  by 37 and 27 
per cent respectively  for the 18 and 15 cwts compared  with the control  
stocking  rate of 12 cwt per acre. It must be borne in mind that the 
usual stocking  rate on the majority  of farms is only 8 cwt per acre. It 
is reasonable  to conclude  therefore  that output  per acre can be doubled
75
without  affecting  individual  animal  gain. There  were differences  in per­
formance  between  farms and within farms between  years. Unusually  
long drought  periods  were experienced  on all farms during 1975 and 
1976. Nevertheless,  animal  performance  remained  quite good even at the 
highest  stocking  rate. These  demonstrations  clearly  showed  that stocking 
rates of up to about 16 cwts per acre with modest  inputs  of nitrogen  are 
practical.
Integrated  systems  of production
In Ireland  production  of beef from the calf stage on the same farm is 
rarely practiced.  There is a multi-stage  chain of production  with the 
animal  changing  hands  several  times throughout  its lifetime.  There is a 
strong trading pattern which diverts attention  away from technical  
efficiency  factors. Winter  feed shortage  is accentuated  because  a farmer  
is never  really  sure of how many  cattle  he will over-winter  and often  finds  
himself  with more cattle than he has sufficient  feed for. Trading  patterns  
produce  unstable  incomes  from year to year because  of the large effect  
which buying  and selling have on output. This is shown in Table 7. 
Systems  No. 1 and No. 2 are typical  trading  systems  while No. 3 is a 
fully integrated  one and Nos. 4 and 5 are part ’y integrated.  Details  of 
these systems  have been published*^'.

The future
Production  per acre in cattle farming  enterprises  is generally  poor. 
Farmers  and agricultural  advisers  must aim for improvements  in stand ­
ards of silage quality,  stocking  rates and general  levels of husbandry.  
Furthermore,  the beef production  chain needs  to be streamlined,  so that

technical  efficiency  is rewarded.  The ideal is the production  of beef from  
the calf stage on the one farm. Alternatively,  the production  of beef from  
the weanling  stage on the same farm is recommended.  In this regard,  
there are lessons  from the pig industry.  It is considered  that a proportion  
of farmers  would  rear the calves  and sell them as young  cattle,  say at 12 
or 18 months,  on a contractual  basis to farmers  who would finish them. 
This kind of development  will require  promotion  and encouragement  by 
the meat plants. Already  one meat company,  namely,  I.M.P.,  has taken  
steps in this area. Moreover,  factories  must start paying  for meat on a 
standardised  quality  basis. This would  create  the incentive  necessary  to 
produce  quality  beef in the form of bull beef, two year old bullock  beef 
and beef from continental  type animals.  This development  would be in 
the long-term  interest  of meat plants and would facilitate  access  to the 
higher priced markets  in Europe. If meat factories  were to take this 
action  producers  would  respond  by producing  younger  and better  quality  
beef. There  is the example  of a few years  ago when producers  embarked  
on a bull beef pilot project.  A major  responsibility,  therefore,  rests with 
the meat plants  and their actions  will profoundly  influence  the develop ­
ment of cattle production.
Lending  institutions  must also plyay a more fxjsitive  role in helping  to 
promote  a more integrated  form of beef production.
Finally,  farming  organisations  could use their expertise  and influence  
in helping  to change  the face of cattle production  in the country.

The Role of Co-operatives  as Large  
Scale Calf Rearers
B. RAFFERTY
Lough  Egish  Co-Op.,  Castleblaney,  Co. Monaghan.
Lough  Egish  Co-operative  has had the experience  over three consecutive  
years of rearing  nearly  5,000 calves  on one farm. We are beginning  to 
understand  the full significance  of this exercise.  Our interest  in central  
calf rearing  arose from the problem  of wide fluctuation  in calf prices. A 
£20 drop in calf prices  is equivalent  to a reduction  of 2p a gallon  in the 
price of milk. The Co-operative  decided  to investigate  how this year to 
year variation  in calf prices  could be overcome.
Centralised  calf rearing
In 1973 a study group from Lough  Egish Co-operative  went to the 
Netherlands  to examine  central  calf rearing  there. Specialised  calf rearers  
in the Netherlands  take in dairy herd replacements  on a fosterage  basis 
and rear them to the point  of calving.  There  are two main advantages  in 
this arrangement : (1) the specialised  calf rearers  were reducing  mortality  
rates by 50%; (2) they were bringing  these replacement  heifers  into the 
herd as milkers  at good weights  at two years of age. They were special ­
ising in the same job year after year on the same farms and they were 
overcoming  disease  problems  by very careful  management  and by strict  
policing  of disease  risks.
We decided  that we would attempt  to rear calves in large numbers,  
with similar  success.
Initially,  whilst  we were not ready to start rearing  replacement  heifers, 
we considered  it important  to help our milk suppliers  to get the best 
results  from their bull calves  and to give our milk suppliers  a good return  
from them. Our approach  was to bring some stability  into an industry  
that is notoriously  short of it. We bring these calves,  mainly  as a by­
produet  of the dairy industry  through  an effeetive  programme  of calf to 
beef rearing,  with the minimum  of waste,  the minimum  of risk and the 
minimum  changes  of ownership.  This year we require  1,000 calves  and 
we are at the moment  in the proeess  of buying  them at various  eollection  
points  around  the Lough  Egish supply  area. To obtain 1,000 calves  we 
must contact  the owners  of more than 4,000 cows. On the assumption  
that half the calves  born will be heifers  and half the remainder  will not 
suit our purpose.
Calf husbandry
The calf rearing  system  is operated  by Vincent  McGee  who farms at 
Ardee,  Co. Louth  and has gained  wide experience  in rearing  5,000  calves.
79
But for the moment  what I propose  to do is to outline some of the 
management  steps and some  of his husbandry  techniques  for rearing  large 
numbers  of calves.
(i) Biestings
Lack of biestings  for the calf within  the first 12 hours is very likely to 
cause health  problems.  Blastings  have essential  antibodies  to protect  the 
calf against  several  diseases.
(ii) Milk replacer
The next rule is to leave the calf on whole milk for not less than 10 
days. Milk replacer  is then gradually  introduced;  we use 1 lb per gallon  
of water  and feed two pints twice a day for the first week. In the second  
week we feed three pints twice a day and in the third week a gallon  a 
day, fed twice daily. At about  four weeks and feeding  a gallon a day 
once a day feeding  can be practiced.  But this does not mean that calves 
are not inspected  till the following  morning;  they must be seen a couple 
of times a day; early detection  of disease  is essential  for success.
We favour the feed barrow  for feeding  replacer  with eight calves 
sucking  at a time. A calf sucking  milk replacer  through  a teat rather  
than drinking  is less likely to get scour. Calves  can be weaned  from  
replacers  at eight weeks. At weaning  time the meal intake increases  to a 
minimum  of 4 lbs per head per day.
(iii) Meals
During  this period  of introducing  milk replacer  the calf will not be fed 
to full appetite  and consequently  will consume  small amounts  of fresh 
meal pencils  when offered. A calf on cow ’s milk continuously  will be 
fed to appetite  and will not eat meal pencils.  The earlier  that meals  are 
offered  to the calf the better  and should  be offered  fresh each day.
(iv) Water  and hay
Calves  should  have fresh water available  each day. Good hay should 
be offered  from about  4-5 weeks  onwards.
(v) Housing
The calf house  should  be dry, airy, well ventilated  and most important  
of all it should be free of draughts.  This may require  only a bale of 
straw in the right place. About  10 sq. feet floor area per calf is allowed. 
A hard core floor can often give better  drainage  than concrete  floors.  But 
irrespective  of type of floor it is important  to keep a dry bed under the 
calf. Calf houses  should  be cleaned  out and disinfected  as soon as the 
calves  are turned  out to grass and they should  be rested before  the next 
batch of calves  arrive.
In large units a special  pen or isolation  area with an infra-red  lamp  
should always  be provided  for sick calves. All calves with scours or 
pneumonia  should  be isolated  immediately.
80
(vi) Health
The main health  problems  are scour,  pneumonia,  lice and worms.  The 
most common  cause of scour is overfeeding  in early life. Overfeeding  
causes nutritional  scours which,  while probably  in themselves  are not 
very harmful,  can give rise to bacterial  scours. Every calf that shows 
signs of scour should  be taken off replacer  immediately  and be put on 
an electolyte  mixture.
A calf with a nutritional  scour  shows  no temperature  change  but there  
is a temperature  change with bacterial  scours. Virus pneumonia  is 
caused  by lack of ventilation  and draughts  and is usually  found in damp,  
stuffy calf houses  with high condensation.  Apart  from the risk of death,  
an affected  calf will thrive poorly.
(vii) Summer  grazing
At twelve  weeks  of age calves  are turned  out to grass during  the day. 
With shelter,  they ean be allowed  out day and night after a few days. 
After turnout,  calves are fed 2-3 lb meals/head/day.  If heifers are 
required  to calve at two years of age, feeding  some meal through  the 
first summer  may be necessary  unless  grass is very good. Growth  rate for 
all calves  should  be maintained  at one and a half lbs per day. A heifer  
should be 600-700  lbs liveweight  at bulling. The importance  of early  
calving  must be emphasised  because  the early calf on average  will be 
200 lbs heavier  in October  than the late calf. January  calves,  for example,  
should  be generally  550 lbs by October/November.
Grass for ealves  should  always  be young,  leafy and nutritious.  Calves  
should be rotationally  grazed  either in front of cows or in individual  
paddocks.  They should be transferred  at least once a week to fresh  
grass. This may require  subdivision  into small paddocks  if they are not 
being grazed ahead of cows; an electric fence controls  calves very 
effeetively.
The grass should  not be allowed  to become  stemmy.  If cows are not 
grazed  after the calves  the grass will require  topping  several  times  during  
the year. The feeding  quality  of stemmy  grass is jroor, so nothing  is lost 
by topping  and the growth  of young  leafy grass is promoted.
Clean drinking  water  should  be provided.
Calves  should be worm dosed on turn-out  to grass and dosed each 
month  afterwards.  This may appear  expensive  but a calf that does not 
thrive is also very expensive.  By regular  dosing,  hoose and stomach  
worms  are effectively  overcome.
Calf quality  improved
The impact  of the Lough  Egish Calf Scheme  on the farming  area has 
been obvious.  We have shown  our intent by buying  5,000 calves at an 
average  price of about £50. Farmers  have responded  accordingly  and 
now we can see the difference  particularly  in the quality  of the calves 
available.
On arrival at 14-21 days they are vastly superior  to those of three  
years ago. This is mainly  a reflection  of better rearing  in the first 10 
days. We are also conscious  of a great improvement  in breeding.  Having  
demonstrated  that there is a reliable  market  for the good quality  Friesian  
bull calf, we are being supplied  with comparative  ease.
The existance  of fixed points for delivery  of calves is a valuable  aid 
to management.  On a one-man  farm the farmer  has the advantage  of a 
fixed time and fixed place for delivery  without  wasting  time.
Calf mortality  is 1% and there is a further  1% of calves  lost on grass  
up to the age of 12 months. In relation  to national  averages  this is 
exceptionally  good.
We are pleased  that the Livestock  Division  of Lough  Egish,  which  was 
started primarily  as a service to our suppliers,  left the Co-op.  with a 
profit of £43,000  in 1976.
Integrated  calf to beef production
In an attempt  to reap the full benefit  from our calf rearing  enterprise  
we should  now be examining  integrated  calf to beef livestock  systems.
The Agricultural  Institute  has reported  production  targets for the 
steady  growth  and early finishing  of Irish cattle. These targets  have be­
come realities  in our Co-operative.  We have bulls for slaughter  at two 
years old weight  12-12^  cwt. They are the product  of a planned  produc ­
tion pattern  with no setbacks  arising  from changes  of farming  systems  
and changes  of ownership.
For efficiency  and profits in livestock  production  we must think in 
terms of a much closer relationship  between  the breeder  and finisher  of 
cattle.
If the finisher  is investing  for example  £350 in an animal  and £100 in 
housing  it, he cannot  afford to change  his luck. Is there any sense re­
maining  in a situation  where he has no more than a rough idea of what  
his store cattle will stand him the following  autumn  ? The time has 
arrived  to examine  very closely the advantages  of becoming  a share ­
holder  in a weaning  pool. In such a pool of weanlings  we can estimate  
and budget  on the 1st October  1977 the cost of cattle on October  1st 
1978.
In conclusion,  I believe  that the Co-ops.  have a role in setting  up the 
kind of structure  which allows  such pools or contract  arrangements  to 
function.  1 think  that it is not necessarily  a job for the dairy co-operative.  
Equally,  the meat factories  could have field staff to provide  liaison  be­
tween farmers. Alternatively,  a completely  new form of co-operative  
could be set up which  would  draw together  the interests  of the producers  
and the fatteners  of cattle.
The ultimate  objective  is that cattle would move from producer  to 
fattener  to factory  in three efficient  stages  and the entire industry  would 
be the better  for that.

A Development  Programme  for Large  
and High Yielding  Dairy Herds

This paper  describes  the programme  that is in progress  at the Edinburgh  
School  of Agriculture  which  is planned  to meet the needs  of the majority  
of dairy farmers  in the East of Scotland.  It is based on information  both 
from research  and commercial  farm experience  and is promoted  in 
critical investigations  in the University  herd and through  recording  in 
commercial  herds. It provides  the basis for the extension  activity  which  
is projected  by specialist  advisers  through  the general  advisers  in the field.  
The whole  range  of activities  from teaching  to research,  development  and 
advisory  activity  is integrated  within  the same organisation,  combining  a 
range  of specialist  disciplines  and engaging  in joint activity  with Research  
Institutes.
Milk production  in the East of Scotland  : the context  for development
In the East of Scotland  there are now some 500 dairy herds,  with an 
average  size for ‘one-man ’ units of 90 cows and for ‘two-man ’ units of 
145 cows (Bell and Dodds,  1976). About  threequarters  of the herds are 
milked  in Herringbone  parlours.  Approximately  one half of the parlour-  
milked  herds in the Development  Programme  are housed  in straw  courts,  
the other half in cubicles,  usually  on sawdust  (Bell, Brocklehurt,  Miller,  
Prescott,  Nicholson,  Pearson  and Mathieson,  1976).
Two-thirds  of the herds are predominantly  British  Friesian;  the re­
maining  third are Ayrshire  (Bell and Miller, 1976). The number  of 
Friesians  is increasing  and Canadian  Holsteins  accounted  for 1 % of dairy  
bulls in 1975/76.
A notable  feature  of the Scottish  Dairy Industry  is the less widespread  
use of A.I. than in England  and Wales  (SMMB,  1976) and the larger  size 
of Scottish  herds has been suggested  as being a possible  influencing 
factor. Performance  of recorded  herds and the relative  use of A.I. and 
natural  service  are summarised  in Table 1.
Intensive  grassland  use at a stocking  rate of approximately  2.5 cows/  
ha (a cow to the acre) is characteristic  of the sample  of 25 costed  herds  
(Dodds,  1976). Most  large herds use silage at the basis of winter  feeding, 
and of the 120 samples  analysed  by the Advisory  Nutrition  Department
* Dr. C. Smith,  Animal  Breeding  Research  Organisation,  Edinburgh
* The average  for all recorded  herds in the East of Scotland  was 1000 gallons 
(4500 kg).

half were classed  as ‘Grass  Silage ’ with a mean DM content  of 24% and 
half as ‘High Dry Matter  Silage ’ of 33%. The nutritive  values  of these 
silages  were on average  11 and 10 MJoules  ME/kg  DM with 15 and 
13% CP, respectively.  Wilting  is common  practice  and additives  are 
used to a limited  extent. The use of precision-chop  forage  harvesters  is 
increasing;  already  over 50% of the silages  analysed  had been harvested  
in this way. Many of the larger  dairy units are changing  from self-feed  
systems  to trough  feeding  using forage  wagons.
Milk sales last year in costed herds averaged  1100 gallons  (5000 kg)* 
with a concentrate  use of 29 cwt (1500 kg), a margin  over concentrates  
of £312/cow  and a gross margin/cow  of £250 (Dodds,  1976).
Over recent  years  (with the exception  of a notable  period  of six months  
in 1974/75)  the relative  price of milk and concentrates  has justified —
(i) liberal  feeding  of cows in early lactation;
(ii) generous  feeding  of cows in mid-lactation  when they have been 
yielding  over 5 gallons  (22 kg) per day).
With profitability  being progressively  threatened  as overhead  costs 
inflate more rapidly  than milk prices,  producers  have in the main sus­
tained net incomes  by securing  higher milk yields per cow. In most  
instances,  this has been associated  with higher levels of concentrate  
feeding.
The target for the future is likely to be 600 - 700 kg (1500 gallons)  of 
milk sold/cow/annum  from 100 to 200 cow herds with initially  0.30 kg 
concentrate/kg  milk, gradually  improving  with higher  silage intakes  and 
more efficient  feeding  practices  to 0.25 kg concentrates  per kg of milk.
Development  of the Langhill  herd
The intensification  of production  from the University  herd at Langhill 
has foreshadowed  the trends  in the industry  at large.  Ayrshires  have been
84
progressively  replaced  by Friesians  and the self-feed  silage system has 
been partially  replaced  by forage-box  feeding,  permitting  higher  levels  of 
concentrate  feeding  and resulting  in higher  yields.
The herd of 175 British  Friesian  cows is stocked  at slightly  more than 
2.5 cows/ha  of grass and milked  by two men with week-end  relief. Last 
year (1975)  just over 1268 gallons  (5757 kg)/cow  were sold with use of 
0.32 kg concentrates/kg  milk; this from a herd containing  an unusually  
high proportion  of heifers  and with the cows averaging  close to 1400 
gallons  per lactation.
The increase  in yield (from 950 gallons  in 1970, to 1040 gallons  in 
1973 and 1270 gallons  in 1976) has been associated  with increased  feed­
ing of concentrates —mainly  in the first 100 days of lactation —and there  
has been a substantial  increase  in margin  over concentrates  to £350/cow  
in 1976 (see Table 2). This improvement  and the prospects  for further  
increases  in yield reflect not only the genetic  potential  of the cows and 
improvements  in feeding,  but also depend  on the high standard  of live­
stock husbandry  provided  by a dedicated  dairyman.

' start of the project
The establishment  and objectives  of the Langhill  project
The development  project  was initiated  at Langhill  in 1973. Critical  
investigations  in this herd are the central  feature  of the whole  develop ­
ment programme  and serve as a focus of attention  for extension  activity.
The objective  of the development  programme  for the herd is to use it 
as a ‘test bed ’ for the evaluation  of the techniques  the individual  dairy  
farmer  can apply to the breeding  and management  of a large and high 
yielding  herd.
The project involves  genetic  improvement  and an emphasis  on the 
management  practices  which  will best sustain  high yields.
The genetic  improvement  programme  is being developed  jointly by 
staff of the School  of Agriculture  and the Animal  Breeding  Research  
Organisation.  The evaluation  of management  includes  a significant  vet­
erinarian  involvement.  The project  receives  substantial  financial  support  
from both the Scottish  Milk Marketing  Board and the Milk Marketing  
Board of England  and Wales.
85
Genetic  improvement
The improvement  of the genetic  potential  of dairy cows for high yields 
of milk and milk solids must be based on production  records  and the 
selection  of bulls on the milking  performance  of their daughters.  Selec ­
tion of bulls is most effective  when undertaken  in a wide spread  of herds  
by Artificial  Insemination.  The individual  dairy farmer  can improve  the 
genetic potential  of his own herd by consistently  using semen from 
proven  sires rated well above  average  on ICC (based  on the performance  
of their daughters).  Intense  selection  of females  in large herds and still 
more from a large number  of recorded  herds can also contribute  to 
genetic  improvement.
The Langhill  project  has been established  to measure  and demonstrate  
the genetic  progress  towards  higher  yields  of milk and milk solids that 
can be made by an individual  herd that sets out to make full use of 
production  records  and intense  selection  of breeding  stock.
The main features  of this part of the project  are :
(i) Emphasis  on selection  objectives  based  on performance  records.
(ii) Estaolishment  of a ‘selected  herd ’; involving  both selected  heifers  
from a wide range of herds throughout  the U.K. as well as selected 
homebred  heifers.
(iii) Use of semen  from a limited  number  of the most outstanding  prog­
eny tested bulls for breeding  heifer  replacements.
(iv) Selection  of cows on the basis of “ indexed  ” breeding  value, for 
breeding  replacements;  and minimisation  of cow wastage  rates.
(v) Evaluation  of genetic  progress  by comparison  with a genetic  control  
herd.
Selection  objectives
Selection  of bulls and cows is principally  on yield of total milk solids.  
In the first two years of the project  information  on milk fat yield was 
generally  available,  but comparable  information  on milk protein  yield  
has only become  available  more recently. The principal  feature of 
selection  will henceforth  be protein  production.
Consideration  was given to the possibility  of selecting  for efficiency  of 
production  rather than yield as such, but the information  on which to 
base bull selection  for this characteristic  is not available.  However,  the 
relationship  between  yield and efficiency  of feed conversion  will be 
monitored  directly  in selected  cows whose bulk (total) feed intake will 
be recorded,  and indirectly  in all cows by expressing  yield relative  to 
liveweight  and also recording  condition  score at different  stages  of lac- 
lation. It is of crucial  importance  that there is identification  of those 
cows that are high yielding  because  they are large and have a large feed 
intake;  those more moderate  in size and intake  that sustain  high yields 
by mobilising  fat in early lactation  and replacing  it later; and those which 
have a high intake  of feed relative  to liveweight  and overall  are likely  to 
convert  feed into milk more efficiently.
86
Objective  criteria  for culling  on the grounds  of illhealth  or disfunction  
will be applied  by veterinarians.  The inter-relation  between  selection  for 
high production  and length of productive  life is a feature  of particular  
interest.
Features  of type are being assessed  by the British Friesian  Cattle  
Society,  so that the association  between  variation  in production  and type 
can be monitored.
Herd establishment
Contract  matings  between  exceptional  cows in a wide spread  of herds  
and the best proven  sires are already  arranged  by the Milk Boards  in 
order  to obtain  young  bulls for progeny  testing. The Langhill  project  has 
negotiated  with herd owners  to purchase  heifer  calves  from a selection  of 
these matings.  This will permit  an initial  comparison  to be made  between  
the selected  ‘purchased ’ heifers from the ‘National  herd ’ and selected 
‘homebred ’ heifers. When the selected  herd is fully established  it will be 
based equally  upon purchased  and homebred  heifers  (85 of each).
A comparison  of the ICC ’s of the sires and productive  performance  of 
the dams for the first 50 purchased  heifers  and their homebred  contem ­
poraries  is presented  in Table 3.

Yields  of the 18 purchased  heifers  which calved at 25-26 months  of 
age and which have completed  their first lactations,  have more than 
confirmed  expectations  that they would yield substantially  more than 
their homebred  contemporaries.  It should be noted that much of their  
expected  advantage  is associated  with the apparent  superiority  of their
87
dams. So far small numbers  are involved  and the actual advantage  of 
the purchased  heifers  is not significantly  different  to that expected  and 
is associated,  in part, with their heavier  liveweight  at calving.  The yields 
of both homebred  and purchased  heifers  have averaged  over 500 kg (1100  
gallons).
Sire selection
The sires selected  for use on cows in the herd are the THREE  British  
Friesian  bulls with the highest  ICC ’s for protein  yield,  that are currently  
available  nationally  through  A.I. and are based on adequate  weighting. 
Bulls are replaced  as soon as better  candidates  become  available  and the 
extent  to which any one bull is used in the herd is kept under  constant  
review.
The minimum  selection  standards  that apply  are shown  below  ;
ICC Milk ICC Fat ICC Protein Weightings 
+ 250 kg + 10 kg + 10 kg 25
The three bulls recently  selected  for use have ICC ’s for protein  almost  
double  the standard,  e.g.
ICC (14/2/77) Weighting 
Terling  Conductor  + 17 kg (56)
Chapelry  Winpad  2nd + 17 kg (28.5)
Brinbower  Clansman  +18kg  (26)
(limited  use)
Heifers  also are bred to a proven  Friesian  bull which  not only meets  the 
minimum  selection  standard  for ICC but also has a progeny  test record 
of minimal  calving  difficulties,  e.g.
ICC Weighting
Collycroft  Password  + 11 kg (299)
Dam selection
In order  to more precisely  identify  the potential  breeding  value of each 
cow in the herd, a system  of cow INDEXING  is used which combines  
with due weighting  all the available  information  on —
(i) the individual  production  records
(ii) the ICC of the Sire
(iii) the performance  of the Dam (and if possible  SISTERS  and 
DAUGHTERS).
Currently  indexes  for each cow are updated  annually  and expressed 
as shown  below  :

L. Frances  7th 7 - 262 - 9 0.78 G +
88
Up to the present  the best 70% of the cows have been used for 
breeding  replacements.  Attention  is now being directed  to means of 
reducing  wastage  due to infertility  and ill health in order to permit a 
greater  intensity  of selection  for yield of milk and milk con.stituents.
Evaluation  of genetic  progress
A ‘genetic  control  herd ’ is currently  being established,  in which 45 
cows will be maintained,  by random  mating  and culling,  at a stable  
genetic  level. The herd is based on a selection  of 30-35 of the older cows  
already  in the Langhill  herd in 1976 (25% of all the cows). These cows  
and their progeny  will be mated  with a bank of frozen  semen  which  has 
been laid down from 50 young  British  Friesian  sires, randomly  selected 
from the bulls entering  the National  A.I. progeny  testing  programme  in 
1976.
These ‘control ’ cows will calve contemporaneously  with ‘selected ’ cows  
and be subject  to identical  feeding,  management  and culling  procedures.  
The difference  in production  between  the two herds should provide  an 
estimate  of genetic  progress,  in the selected  herd and a basis for com­
parison  with the National  A.I. stud.
Evaluation  of management  practices
Associated  with the breeding  programme  are investigations  of those 
features  of feeding  and management  that are required  to sustain  high 
lifetime  production.  The objective  of this part of the programme  is to 
critically  evaluate  production  records  from the herd, to identify  environ ­
mental  factors  limiting  the expression  of the cows ’ genetic  potential  and 
to develop  improved  management  practices  to overcome  these limitations.  
A team of specialists  in Animal  Production,  Ruminant  Nutrition,  Veter ­
inary Medicine  and Farm Management  are currently  involved  with this.
Heifers  are bred to calve for the first time at about two years of age 
and their performance  is being intensively  recorded  (e.g., milk yields, 
regularity  of calving,  regular  weights,  health and length of productive  
life). Particular  attention  is being directed  to the relationship  between 
the shape of the lactation  curve,  changes  in body weight  and condition,  
as well as the quality  of the available  feed. In future,  total feed intakes  
of selected  cows will be measured  at diflferent  stages  of lactation.
Calving  at (wo years  of age
The potential  advantage  of earlier  calving  at about two years of age 
are : reduced  production  costs, land, working  capital and housing  re­
quirements  (MLC  -MMB,  1976). For example,  the maintenance  require ­
ments  to produce  a down-calving  heifer  of 1100 lb (500 kg) are reduced  
by one-third  if age at first calving  is reduced  from three years to two 
years. It is, however,  evident  from bull progeny  testing  that the majority  
of heifers  in commercial  herds calve about 30 months  of age and many  
still calve at closer  to 36 months  (SMMB,  1976).
The selection  of age at first calving  is much influenced  by the risk of 
dystokia  and calf mortality.  The incidence  of dystokia  in heifers is
89
usually double that of cows and increases  when heifers are calved  
younger  than 24 months.
The management  guidelines  to which  we operate  in this respect  are —
(i) A minimum  bulling  weight  of 750 lb (340 kg)
(ii) heifers  given two opportunities  for insemination  with a selected  
Friesian  sire, proven  to sire small calves
(iii) follow-up  with an Angus  bull
(iv) condition  score 6-8 weeks  pre-calving  of 3
(v) minimum  pre-calving  weight  of 1100 lb (500 kg)
(vi) minimum  post-partum  weight  1000 lb (450 kg).
In order to sustain  a uniform  level of milk production  from the herd 
throughout  the year, two-thirds  of the heifers  are bred to calve in Sep­
tember/October  and the remaining  third in February/March.  Weights  at 
first insemination  have averaged  over 380 kg and post-partum  weights 
460 to 520 kg at 25-27  months.  The use of a bull that sired ‘90 lb calves ’ 
posed some problems  with one of the first groups  of heifers  which  calved 
in overfat  condition,  but more recently  the use of a selected  bull siring 
‘75 lb calves ’ has resulted  in very few difficulties.  Effective  bull selection 
and close control  of pre-calving  condition  must go hand in hand with a 
successful  reduction  in calving  age.
The first lactation  yields  of heifers  in the project  are currently  averag ­
ing over 5000 kg. The consequent  effects  of such high yields,  on sub­
sequent  weight  gain, rebreeding,  calving  interval,  performance  in later 
lactations  and overall  lifetime  production  will be of particular  interest.
Feeding  system  to sustain  high yields
(a) Subdivision  of the herd
The herd is currently  managed  in two groups;  an early lactation  
group  and a mid/late  lactation  group. The former  receives  preferen ­
tial treatment  in terms of feed quality  and availability.  Cows move  
from one group  to the other in mid-lactation  when they decline  below
20 to 25 kg in daily milk yield. For the future,  an improved  building  
lay-out  will enable  the herd to be managed  in three groups,  matched  
for season  of calving.  The intention  is that the majority  of cows will 
remain  in the same group  with other cows at the same stage of lac­
tation throughout  the production  cycle.
(b) Grazing
The two groups  each graze on separate  areas, each subdivided  into
21 X 1 day paddocks,  at an initial stocking  rate of 5 cows/ha.  The 
early lactation  groups  graze the area closest  to the steading.  Some of 
the grazing  paddocks  may initiallly  be cut for silage and as the season  
progresses  grazing  intensity  can be reduced  somewhat  by removal  of 
dry cows from the second  group. In late July - early August  onwards  
grazing  extends  outside  the original  paddock  area and on to silage  
aftermaths.  The need for this is especially  critical  in dry years.
In the autumn  period  of the past year, extra attention  has been given  
to the 40 cows in the critical  early stage of lactation;  both by ensur ­
90
ing that they have the best grazing  and arranging  for an extra late 
afternoon  feed of concentrates  (this is commented  on further  later).  
Kale is introduced  into the diet of the whole  herd in the autumn  and 
provides  an intermediary  for the change  from grazing  to winter  feed­
ing on silage.
Silage  feeding
(i) Early  lactation  group
In the winter  period the early lactation  group (of 70 to 80 cows)  
receives  silage ad lib., dispensed  into a trough  once-a-day  by a Kidd  
forage  box. Concentrates  are fed twice-a-day  in the parlour  and in 
addition  concentrates  and potatoes  or dried beet pulp are fed twice- 
a-day (mid-morning  and early evening)  in the trough. Allowances  of 
concentrates  in the trough  are consumed  on a group  basis at a level 
that is assumed  to be equivalent  to 5 kg concentrates/head.  At each 
milking,  cows receive  individual  allowances  of concentrates  that rise 
to 5 kg/cow/milking  over the first three to four weeks  of lactation  
and then, as cows decline  from peak after 8 weeks,  may be adjusted  
down to 3 kg/cow/milking  depending  on yield.
In the early stage of lactation  cows with a potential  to yield 35 kg of 
milk/day  may receive  as much  as 15 kg concentrates.  In this situation,  
every care is taken to ensure  they are also able to consume  at least 
5 kg DM/head/day  of silage.
(ii) Mid/late  lactation  group
This group  has continuous  access  to self-fed  silage,  from which  they 
are estimated  to consume  8 to 9 kg DM/day.  Brewers  grains  (wet)  
are fed once each day in the trough  to provide  a further  2 to 3 kg 
DM and 5 kg of concentrates  are fed in the parlour  to cows yielding 
20 kg or more/day.  It is recognised  that the high forage  low con­
centrate  diet (or indeed the all forage  diet) of lower yielding  cows  
may be deficient  in phosphorus.  High phosphorus  minerals  are, there ­
fore, made available  on a free choice basis as well as being incor ­
porated  into the concentrates.
The implications  of this feeding  programme  in relation  to a group  
of cows calving  in mid-winter  are illustrated  in Figure  1.
(iii) Complete  diets
For the future,  consideration  is being  given to adopting  a ‘complete  
diet ’ feeding system, using a mixer wagon that will produce  a 
thorough  mix of:
Precision  chopped  silage  
homegrown  cereals  
potatoes  or beet pulp 
protein/mineral  supplement
The advantages  of this in nutritional  terms should be most evident  
with the high yielding  early lactation  cows in terms of more rapid  
and consistent  attainment  of a high energy  intake  with minimum  risk 
of digestive  upsets. However,  once the capital  investment  has been

made it will be most convenient  to use the system  for all groups  of 
cattle. The saving  of labour,  improvement  of working  conditions  for 
the dairyman,  replacement  of bought-in  concentrates  by homegrown  
cereals and simplified  control of feeding  by management  are all 
major  attractions.
The critical pre-condition  is that building  layout must enable the 
herd to be sub-divided  into at least three groups,  with adequate  
trough  space for each cow.
It is anticipated  that at any one time three diets, for early lactation  
(first 100 days),  for mid lactation  and for late lactation  cows,  will be 
fed. Formulations  will need to be adjusted  periodically  to allow for 
the variation  in the nutritive  value of the silage,  the observed  level 
of intake  of the total diet and the range  of yield of cows in the group.  
Adequate  provision  for subdivision  of the herd will be essential  in 
order to prevent  low yielding  cows becoming  excessively  fat on un­
duly concentrated  diets or under-feeding  of potentially  higher  yielders.
Herd management  control
The milk yield of each cow in the herd is recorded  weekly.  Cows are 
weighed  at fortnightly  intervals  in early lactation  and monthly  intervals  
thereafter.  They are condition  scored  at calving,  8 weeks  and 16 weeks 
after calving,  and at drying  off. This information,  together  with regular  
analyses  of the bulk feeds in the diet, is used for the evaluation  of 
management  practices.  The comparison  of predicted  milk yields with
92
actual  performance  is the key feature  of this approach.  Lactation  curves 
for heifers  and cows of different  months  are being accumulated  in order  
to develop  standard  curves  for prediction  purposes.
The evaluation  of management  has two components  ;

(ii) evaluation  of retrospective  performance  providing  information  on 
which to base development  and future policy.
Current  evaluation  involves  using the records  from an INDICATOR  
GROUP  of 10 to 20 cows, which have calved within a 14-day  period.  
Attention  focuses  on the rise to peak and the level of peak yield attained  
and then the rate of decline  of yield in mid-lactation.  Changing  milk 
yields  are graphed  against  calendar  dates  and related  to changes  in feed­
ing and management.  An expected  rate of decline  of 2.5% per week is 
used as the basis for comparison.

This is illustrated  in Figure  2, in which  the features  to note are :

later).
(ii) In October,  the transition  from grazing  to full winter  feeding  was 
satisfastory.
(iii) At the end of December,  potatoes  were replaced  by concentrates,  
without  depression  of yield.
(iv) In January,  a virus infection  in the cows caused  scours  and a yield  
depression.
(v) Re-introduction  of potatoes  in February,  probably  coineided  with 
recovery  of appetite  after the infection  and raised  yields.
(vi) In April,  the effect  of turn-out  to grass is confounded  with the pre­
vious  increase  in concentrate  feeding.  An extra  0.3 kg concentrates/  
cow/day  resulted  in slightly  less than an 0.3 kg response  in yield;  
not an economic  response  at current  prices.
Retrospective  evaluation  is undertaken  with successive  monthly  calv­
ing groups  of 10 to 15 cows. Milk yields are plotted against  stage  
of lactation  to identify  lactation  curves. Liveweight  changes  are related  
to these, as are eoncentrate  allowances  and periodic  records  on cow 
condition  and bulk feed quality  (and availability).
A summary  of recorded  information  related  (for simplicity)  to cows  
calving  in the autumn,  mid winter,  late winter  and spring is presented 
in Table  4. Attention  is directed  to peak milk yield,  rate of decline  post­
peak and total lactation  yield; cumulative  concentrate  consumption  in

peak ranging  from 2.0 to 2.9%.
The performance  of autumn  calving  cows  and of the spring  calves  merit  
further  comment.

Spring  calvers
It is a feature  of the spring  calvers  that they have the highest  peaks,  
slowest  rate of decline  and the highest  total yield associated  with quite  
moderate  levels of concentrate  feeding  (see Figure  3). However,  in this 
particular  case the cows were older than average;  (6th lactation)  had

longer  dry periods  (72 days) and calving  intervals  (400 days) and were, 
of course,  producing  milk in early lactation  from spring grass. Their  
performance  does, however,  illustrate  the potential  of grazing  and mod ­
erate levels of concentrate  feeding  (0.25 kg/concentrates/kg  milk) with 
the high yielding,  spring  calver.
Autumn  calvers
Autumn  calving  cows (August/September),  while they had similar  
peak yields to the average,  had a markedly  faster rate of decline  close  
to 3% per week. In this respect,  those cows which  calved  in the autumn  
and had above average  peak yield declined  so rapidly  that their final 
lactation  yield was in fact lower  than those with a lower  peak yield,  viz.. 
Autumn  calvers —Higher  peak 34±0.4  kg lactation  yield 5298  + 39 kg 
—Lower peak 30+0.4  kg lactation  yield 5569+118  kg
95
By contrast,  winter  calving  cows with a similar  peak yield had total lac­
tation yeilds  considerably  higher  than the autumn  calvers,  viz..
Winter calvers  (35) peak yield 32±1 kg; lactation  yield 5720±120  kg 
Autumn  calvers  (18) peak yield 32+1 kg; lactation  yield 5278+  193 kg 
A probable  explanation  for these differences  was the lower level of sup­
plementary  feeding  provided  for high yielding  autumn  compared  with 
winter  calving  cows over the first eight weeks  of lactation.  Over the past 
two years specific  attention  has been given to the provision  of additional  
concentrate  feeding  to autumn  calvers  in order to obviate  this limitation.
However,  in the second year of the study, the dominant  feature  in­
fluencing  the lactation  yields of the autumn  calvers  (22 cows) was the 
lower peak yield of 28+1 kg and a slow rate of decline  of 1.3 + 0.1% per 
week thereafter.  Winter  calvers  on the other hand again peaked  at 33 + 
0.7 kg and declined  at the expected  rate of 2.1 ±0.1% per week and a 
probable  explanation  for this disparity  has been found in the differences 
in weight gain and body condition  between  successive  calvings. The 
autumn  calving  cows regained  their post-partum  weight  by turn out and 
then made little further  gain on summer  grazing,  which after July was 
affected  by drought  conditions.  Thus at calving  in the autumn  of 1975,  
cows commencing  their second  and third lactations  had gained  on aver­
age only 23 and 2 kg respectively  compared  with their calving  weight 
the previous  year. Corresponding  bodyweight  changes  for winter  calving 
cows were gains  of 34 and 19 kg, respectively.  Over the 1975/76  lactation  
the autumn  calving  cows received  more liberal concentrate  feeding  in 
relation  to yield (0.30 kg conc/kg  milk compared  with 0.28 kg conc/kg  
milk) than in the previous  lactation.  In association  with this, not only 
was rate of decline  in milk yield slower,  but liveweight  gains increased. 
The cows were 6.5% heavier  at the subsequent  calving  in autumn  1976 
and peak yields  were up to 30 + 0.8 kg.
Recording  has been extended  to include  regular  condition  scoring  of 
the cows at drying  off, soon after calving,  at service  (or 8 weeks)  and at 
pregnancy  diagnosis  (or 16 weeks  after calving).
Feed intake
As a development  of the previous  investigation,  estimates  of the bulk 
feed intake of selected  groups  of cows have been made using general 
prediction  equations  such as those provided  by Technical  Bulletin  33. 
However,  this approach  is of limited  precision  and attention  is also being 
directed  to the use of electronic  doors set in a tombstone  feed-fence,  as 
a means of monitoring  the feed consumption  of individual  cows. The 
technique  has so far been used with small groups  of dry cows. It will 
be extended  to monitoring  the intake of selected  lactating  cows as soon 
as new buildings  are available.
Efficiency  of rebreeding
Complete  breeding  records  are maintained  and are used to identify 
limiting  factors  and potential  problems,  to provide  guidance  for further  
improvements  in calving  intervals  and to demonstrate  sound  management
96
control  of this critical  feature  of herd performance.  As well as regular  
observation  of cows for oestrous,  a ‘teaser ’ bull is penned  close to the 
cows during  the breeding  period  as a stimulus  to oestrous  behaviour  and 
an aid to its detection.
This investigation  makes  use of existing  breeding  records,  to evaluate  
the effectiveness  of heat identification  (in terms of average  interval  from  
calving  to first observed  heat and average  interval  between  observed  
heats) and the factors  responsible  for variation  in conception  rate. Preg ­
nancy diagnosis  per rectum  is being supplemented  by earlier  diagnosis  
of the basis of progesterone  levels in milk. The diagnosis  of possible 
causes  of infertility  is being investigated  by veterinarians  in those 10 to 
15% of cows that show delayed  first heat, irregular  oestrous  cycles or 
return  to service  more than three times.

Inter-relation  of Langhill  to on-farm  development  and extension
Techniques  and management  aids tested and refined  at Langhill  are 
being extended  to commercial  farms, in some cases with follow-up  
recording  and in others  in the form of direct advisory  action. Perform ­
ance at Langhill  is also being compared  with that recorded  on a sample  
of commercial  farms. In this respect  twenty-five  farms are being costed 
in a milik production  systems  investigation  (Dodds,  1976).
Large  herd management
Forty-eight  parlour-milked  herds  in Angus,  Perth  and Fife are involved 
in an investigation  of the relationship  between  husbandry  and health,  
which focuses  particularly  on milking  management,  bulk milk cell count  
and mastitis  control  and also incorporates  investigations  of lameness  and 
herd wastage  (Bell et al., 1976).
Records  and milk samples  have been collected  and assessments  of 
milking  management  carried  out over the past year and a half in the 
course  or regular  monthly  visits by dairy husbandry  advisers  and support  
services  from the Veterinary  Investigation  Laboratory.
The mean milk cell count  for these herds  over a 6-month  winter  period 
was 452,000  cells/ml.  Eight of the 48 herds had counts  below 300.000  
cells/ml.  Over this winter period on average 16% cows and 2% of 
heifers  were treated  for mastitis.  Regular  teat dipping,  which  was under ­
taken in 25 of the herds,  emerged  as the principal  feature  associated  with 
low cell counts. This was especially  evident  in herds housed  in courts,  
where  those teat dipping  had a mean cell count  half as high as those not
97
teat dipping  (340,000  v 700,000  cells/ml).  The majority  of herds are 
using dry cow therapy  with antibiotics  as a regular  routine.
Appraisal  of information  from the first winter  period  has been used to 
draw up a profile  for each herd of milking  management,  variation  in milk 
cell count  and apparent  incidence  of mastitis.  This is now being used as 
the basis for specific  advice  to each co-operator  on a confidential  basis, 
with in selected  cases the involvement  of the farmers ’ veterinary  prac­
titioner  in a collaborative  advisory  action.
The incidence  of lameness  has been assessed  in thirty of these herds. 
The majority  occurred  in winter  in cubicle  housed  herds where the in­
cidence  rose to 10%. Friesians  showed  a higher  incidence  of lameness 
than Ayrshires  and six Friesian  herds housed  in cubicles  had an incid ­
ence of over 20% (Bell and Miller,  1976).
The investigation  of the causes  of culling  in these herds  has highlighted  
the fact that in an overall  culling  rate of 24%, one-third  of culls (8% of 
all cows) were disposed  of because  of failure  to rebreed  (Brocklehurst,  
Bell and Miller, 1976). This rebreeding  problem  emerges  as a priority  
area for further  attention  in this project.  The procedures  that are being 
used at Langhill  are being adapted  for on-farm  development  studies  m 
this area and the husbandry  approach  to Inaprove  regular  rebreeding  has 
been summarised  in an advisory  publication  (Prescott  and Robertson,  
1976).
Breeding  and feeding  for higher  yields
The effective  use of A.I. and selection  of cows for heifer  breeding  on 
the basis of “indexing ” are incorporated  into our advisory  activity.
There is also considerable  interest,  and not a little concern,  about the 
possible  role of Canadian  Holsteins  and their crosses  both in milk and 
beef production.  A few large herds contain  large numbers  of high 
yielding  Holsteins,  but the substantially  lower return from the sale of 
their calves  for beef production  outweighs  much  of the milk yield advan ­
tage of the cows. The investigations  conducted  by the MMB and MLC  
into the beefing  qualities  of the Holstein,  suggest  that they are only 
marginally  inferior  to British  Friesians  in carcass  gain and muscle  : bone 
ratio and not very different  in fat cover. However,  because  of their leggy  
conformation  they are generally  unacceptable  as carcasses  for conven ­
tional meat trading  at the present  time. It is, however,  in many respects 
not unlike  the position  of the Friesian,  twenty  years ago. An economic  
way of raising  Holstein-crosses  to heavy  weights  may be developed  over 
the next few years and the beef market  is changing  its requirements  and 
methods  sufficiently  for there to be a future prospect  of them becoming  
more acceptable.  However,  the extent  to which  Holsteins  will maintain  
a yield advantage  in the face of the steady improvement  in the British 
Friesian  is open to question.
Feeding  for higher  yields is currently  the main theme  of our advisory 
programme  (Lewis  and Prescott,  1975; Prescott  and Lewis,  1976). The 
influence  of feeding  in early lactation  on the production  of a high total 
lactation  yield is emphasised  and the importance  of high quality  silage
98
in reducing  winter  feed costs and sustaining  high yields in mid-lactation  
is exemplified.  Attention  is also drawn  to the importance  of restoring  
body condition  in late lactation  and ensuring  this is maintained  during  
the dry period  so that cows calve in fit condition  with a potential  for a 
high peak yield.
As well as concern  with the modification  of self-feed  silage systems  to 
permit  trough  feeding  there is also considerable  interest  in the use of 
selective  automatic  concentrate  feeders  for dispensing  extra concentrates  
to high yielding  cows outside  the parlour  and also in ‘complete  diet ’ 
feeding  systems.  Contact  is being maintained  with a number  of herds  
that have adopted  these innovations  and it is clear that the acceptability  
and accessability  of silage has a critical influence  on the success  of 
selective  automatic  concentrate  feeding  which  can otherwise  give rise to 
digestive  upsets and problems  of low butterfat.  Complete  diet feeding,  
while attractive,  is expensive  in terms of capital equipment  and only 
feasible  in certain  building  layouts.
Herd management  control
Dairy farmers  are being advised  to undertake  regular  checks  on both 
milk production  and cow condition  as an aid to better  management.  In 
particular  it is recommended  that the following  features  are observed  :
(i) the rise to peak and level of peak yields  of their cows;
(ii) the rate of decline  of yields of an ‘INDICATOR ’ group  of cows, 
week by week from the 10th week of lactation  onwards;  expecting  
that yields  will not fall faster than 2% per week;
(iii) the body condition  score of cows,  at strategic  stages  of the produc ­
tion cycle.
Condition  scoring
The dairy cows at Langhill  are condition  scored according  to the 
technique  developed  on beef cows which involves  handling  the cow to 
assess  fat cover  over the spinous  processes  on either  side of the backbone  
in the loin region  (Lowman,  Scott and Somerville,  1976).
Score 1 The individual  spinous  processes  are sharp to touch and easily 
distinguished.
Score 2 The individual  processes  are distinguishable,  but feel rounded  
rather  than sharp.
Score 3 The individual  bones can only be felt with very firm pressure  
and are well covered  with fat.
This scoring  method  can readily  and consistently  be applied  by the 
cowman  whenever  there is an opportunity  to handle  cows. It is most  
useful if the checks  on condition  are made part of a regular  routine  :
(i) when cows are dried off
(ii) when they calve
(iii) about 8 weeks  after calving  (or at first service)
(iv) again at about 16 weeks  after calving  (or at pregnancy  testing).
99
Scores  should  be noted down and a check back through  such records  
will show how cows are changing  in condition  which  can be used as a 
guide to feeding. In general if cows in mid-lactation  fall lower in 
condition  than a score of 2 their feeding  and management  should be 
reviewed  and improved  and in late lactation  and at calving  the aim 
should  be to have them at a condition  score of at least 3.
The returns  from high yielding  cows and the potential  loss that can 
occur if they are mismanaged  or underfed  around  calving  fully justifies  
the extra attention  that checking  of this kind involves.

Co-operative  Support  in Dairy Farm  
Development
T. LYONS
Kerry  Co-Operative  Creameries
In the period 1960-1975  there have been revolutionary  changes  in dairy  
farm production  methods,  in creamery  structure,  product  range,  process ­
ing capacity  and in marketing  strategy.  Farmers,  through  their Co-ops.,  
are basically  in control  of the industry.  Furthermore,  a half dozen  major  
Co-ops.  handle 70% of the manufacturing  milk. Individual  Co-op.  
policy  can therefore  affect  many farmers.
Dairy Co-ops.  are primarily  concerned  with the purchase  of all milk 
produced  by suppliers/shareholders,  its efficient  assembly  and the pro­
duction  of a diversified  range of quality  dairy products,  the objective  
being to obtain  the best return in the market  place for each gallon of 
milk purchased.
However,  since milk is their prime  source  of revenue,  it is logical  that 
policies  to promote  development  and to service  the requirements  of dairy  
farmers  should be pursued  by individual  Co-ops. Irish dairy Co-ops.  
are very often ranked  on the milk price paid to the farmer  and profits 
earned,  with no account  being taken of the range and type of services 
and inputs  provided  to farmers.
Since the average  milk production  per farm is low in Ireland,  milk  
price alone will not solve the income  problems  of many  of our farmers.  
The opportunities  for increasing  dairy farm income  in the future  depends  
on the ability  of all concerned  to improve  low yields.  It now appears  that 
the agricultural  technology,  land resources,  genetic  potential  and financial  
awards  are all available  to accomplish  this task.
This paper  will attempt  to analyse  the problems  affecting  dairy  farmers  
in Kerry and outline  briefly  the policies  of Kerry Co-op.  Creameries  in 
helping  to farm productively.
Dairy  fanning  in Kerry
Kerry  has been traditionally  a dairying  county  and now produces  over 
11 % of Irish milk output. Soil resources  are variable  and have a limited  
use range;  for example  94% of the “arable ” area is under  grass
Because  of soil restrictions  and climatic  conditions  farmers  have only 
limited  opportunities  for non-grassland  enterprises.  Dairying  is therefore  
the chief farm enterprise.
There have been major changes  in milk processing  and creamery  
structure  in Kerry since 1972. In 1970, 90% of the skim milk in the 
country  was fed to livestock.  Now a single organisation  purchases  all 
milk for processing  at two centres  in the county.
103
Following  its formation  in 1974, Kerry  Co-op.  Creameries  set up as a 
priority  an Agricultural  Division  whose role included  the provision  of 
worth while services.  Initially  it was decided  to examine  the .structure  
of dairy farming  in the area as a basis for :
1. Company  policy  to promote,  aid and service  development.
2. Establishing  an agreed  operating  relationship  with Agricultural  and 
Veterinary  agencies.
The main conclusions  from this study were :
1. Herd sizes, milk yields and consequently  milk sales were low; the 
potential  for substantial  expansion  existed.
2. Management  facilities  for expansion  of herds were inadequate  and 
considerable  re-organisation  of farm yards  and farms  was required.  
Expansion  in silage conservation  was necessary  in order to improve 
winter  feed supply  and quality,  bearing  in mind the climatic  condit ­
ions in the county  for hay making.
The incidence  of mastitis  in herds was high and was obviously  affect ­
ing milk yields.
5. Calf rearing  methods  could usefully  be changed.3.

Milk yield per cow
An examination  of the pattern  of milk delivery  to Kerry  Co-op.  indi­
cated that calving  date has a large effect  on milk yield. Less than 8% of 
total milk supply is delivered  before April 1st. From our A.I. records  
we know that nearly  40% of cows calve down after this date.
Role of Co-ops.  in farm development
The Co-operative  can stimulate  development  in a number  of ways :
1. By assemblying  and analysing  information  on dairy farm efficiency  
on a local basis in order to identify  current  performance,  problems  
and constraints.
2. By bringing  this information  to the attention  of farmer  representatives,  
advisory,  farm development  and veterinary  services.
3. Deciding  on an agreed  action  programme  with defined  responsibilities  
and commitments  by each sector.
4. Providing  services  and inputs  as required  to service  development.
5. Structuring  milk pricing  policies  to stimulate  farmer interest and 
action in a given direction.
6. Setting  of targets  for milk output  in each area.
A summary  of the main policies  and services  currently  in operation  is 
presented  in Table 1.
Calving  date
It is to the farmers ’ advantage  now to calve down a creamery  herd 
earlier  in spring. But the advantage  is eroded  in the absence  of high 
quality  silage,  early grass  and liberal  meal feeding  practice.  Many  Co-op. 
Societies  are now operating  an early calving  scheme  so as to encourage

earlier  spring  milk and while this may not solve the high peak for the 
processor  it will nevertheless  increase  throughput  in the earlier  part of 
the year. In Kerry  over the past couple  of seasons  the percentage  increase 
in early spring milik has been twice that of the annual  increase.  The 
vital question  is whether  the industry  should concentrate  on compact  
early spring calving  with its resultant  peaks and troughs  or whether  a 
greater  spread  of calving  should  be encouraged.
Farm  building  and fencing  services
With the advent  of the Farm Modernisation  Scheme  there is much 
planned  development  activity  taking place on farms. The objective  of 
our Farm Buildings  Scheme  is to ensure  that farmers  who have develop ­
ment plans  can complete  their work as specified  in the plan. The scheme  
is operated  with the minimum  of supervisory  and administrative  staff 
using private  contractors  with signed agreements  with the farmer. The 
actual  planning  is caried  out by the Advisory  Service.  Our Farm  Building  
Service  will then prepare  detailed  layout  plans,  costings  and arrange  for 
erection.  The Scheme  has been widely  practised  and to date over 400 
separate  building  projects  have been completed.
Animal  breeding
An A.I. service in Kerry is now under the control  of Kerry Co-op. 
Creameries  and is operated  under  licence  from the Department  of Agri ­
culture. It is now based completely  on a proven  stud. A.I. is of very 
great importance  in the long term improvement  of milk yields.  In practice  
dairy herd management  and feeding  and not genetics  are responsible  for 
low milk yields.
Animal  health
The control of mastitis  and the elimination  of brucellosis  are two 
urgent  tasks facing  dairy farmers.  In addition  to providing  a cell count ­
ing service  and operating  the national  Pre-intensive  Brucellosis  Scheme  
in conjunction  with the Department  of Agriculture  and veterinary  prac­
titioners,  Kerry  Co-op.  has added a financial  incentive  for milk delivered 
which is considered  to be free of these two diseases.
Changes  in recent  years
The changes  in structure  are somewhat  similar  to national  changes.  An 
interesting  feature  has been the change  in milk yield per cow in the 1974 
to 1976 period  (Table  2).
Improvement  in cell connts
The introduction  of a bonus  payment  for milk of low cell counts  has 
created  a greater  awareness  of mastitis  as a disease  and a demand  for 
veterinary  and other advice  on control  measures.  Since the introduction  
of the scheme  there has been a considerable  improvement  in the quantity  
of low cell count milk delivered  (Table  3).

Prospects
A. P. MURPHY
5. Holland  & Son Ltd., Tarporley,  Cheshire.
We are producers  of a product  which has tended  towards  world over­
supply  in the past decade.  To be more precise,  supply  has exceeded  the 
demand  which  exists at economic  price levels —the result being a fall in 
the price which  consumers  need to pay in order  to obtain  supplies.  This 
is a simplified  statement  of a very complex  issue and needs to be ampli ­
fied and put in context.
World  position
World milk production  tends, as a consequence  of political  action,  to 
be divided  into a number  of “blocs ” which  are self contained  in varying  
degrees.  Table 1 shows  the percentage  of world milk production  which 
arises in each of these blocs and a crude estimate  of the proportion  of 
world  milk supplies  which  are surplus  to the domestic  requirement  of the 
individual  bloc. World  surplus  amounts  to about  6% of total production.  
Five sixths  of the surplus  arises in the E.E.C.  and Australasia  taken to­
gether. The other surplus  producing  areas are Western  Europe  (other  
than E.E.C.)  and North  America.
Table I

Eastern  Europe 30% —
N. America 16% 0.5 Vi.
Australasia 3% 2.5%
Others 21% —
Total 100% 6.0%
Reaction  to this situation  is along  the expected  lines. There  have been 
stringent  measures  introduced  in some of the surplus  producing  areas,  
namely  Canada,  Australia  and non-E.E.C.  countries  such as Norway  and 
Switzerland.  Eastern  Europe,  which is usually  roughly  in balance  and
109
cannot  afford the risk of a shortage  because  of lack of foreign  currency  
to pay for imports,  plans to increase  production.  Results  so far are 
modest  and output  is more than usually  dependent  on weather conditions,  
especially  in Russia. U.S.A.  is roughly  in balance.  New Zealand  is so 
heavily  dependent  on her dairy industry  that she has no option but to 
press forward.
Alone  among  the major world blocs, the E.E.C.  has not yet made a 
logical  response  to her position.  The E.E.C.  produces  over 40% of the 
world ’s milk surplus  and where the requirements  of importing  countries  
do not match  the availability  from exporting  countries,  the E.E.C.  is able 
to claim  only about  22% of the world net export  trade (Table  2). There ­
fore, apart from Australasia,  the E.E.C.  is the bloc most severely  out of 
equilibrium  and clearly  has an interest  in redressing  this imbalance  by 
attention  both to its own supply  position  and the world  demand  situation.

E.E.C.  internal  position
A study of the internal  E.E.C.  position  also gives cause for concern. 
Consumption  of liquid milk and butter is steadily  downward  (Tables  3 
and 4), and although  cheese  consumption  is increasing  it in no way 
offsets  the losses  on liquid  milk and butter. Net consumption  is therefore  
downward.
Production,  on the other hand,  appears  to be steadily  increasing,  with 
deliveries  to dairies  up 43% in the 15 years to 1975. It is probably  true 
to say that the security  of the intervention  system,  allied to the steady 
upward  movement  in guaranteed  prices,  has contributed  to this increase.
This alliance  of rising production  and falling  consumption,  leading  to 
higher  stocks  and export  surpluses,  is one which  must concern  us all. It 
is clearly in the interests  of all who value the Common  Agricultural  
Policy,  and who benefit  by it, to aid its preservation  by ensuring  that the 
financial  burdens  arsing  from its operation  do not lead to its downfall.

Ireland —analysis  and projection  
(1) Production
Production  is steadily  rising. The security  of the intervention  system, 
allied to the steady  upward  movement  in prices,  has assisted  this trend.  
Projections  of possible  Irish milk output  in the years 1976 to ’82 together  
with the possible  utilisation  pattern  are shown  in Table  5. It is, however,  
necessary  to qualify  this projection.  It is based on an annual  increase  
in deliveries  to dairies  of approximately  8%; this is an arbitrary  figure  
used simply  to give an idea of the order of magnitude  of the problems  
which  may arise from such an increase.

:i2
For liquid consumption,  1 have assumed  a slight decline over the 
period, and in regard to milk for manufacturing,  1 have assumed  a 
production  pattern  based  on the 1976 figures  which  showed  that 75% of 
milk went into butter production,  with the resultant  skim being used 
chiefly  for skimmed  milk powder  and to a lesser  extent  casein.
Cheese absorbed  17% of manufacturing  milk in 1976. Again, the 
assumption  o the continuation  of this pattern  is arbitrary  although  past 
experience  has shown  the difficulty  of getting  below  the 75% mark as far 
as butter/skim  products  are concerned.
The result of this projection  is that milk for manufacturing  would  
increase  by 63% in the six year period 1976-82  (Table  6).
Table 6 gives estimates  of the amounts  of butter, cheese and skim  
powder  available  for export. The result of this is that in the six year 
period 1976-82,  quantities  of products  available  for export would 
INCREASE  by the following  amounts  :

(a) Domestic  market
The Irish market  is the one which  is most secure  and least vulnerable  
to foreign  competition.  Liquid  milk consumption  per capita is already  
very high but is showing  some decline  (Table  3). Butter  consumption  is 
showing  a similar  trend (Table  4). Cheese  consumption  is showing  an 
increasing  trend but does very little to offset  the losses  in the liquid  milk 
and butter sectors. Therefore,  the overall  picture  is that total milk and 
dairy produce  consumption  in Ireland  is in steady decline. This is a 
serious matter for the dairy industry;  the concern  here is not with 
market  share but with the preservation  and development  of overall  mar­
ket size and it is clearly  in the interests  of the industry,  therefore,  to 
support  and sponsor  all promotional  and marketing  efforts  to persuade  
consumers  to use more milk in its various  forms. It must not be over­
looked,  however,  that products  should  be available  at prices  which  people 
can afford  to pay and it seems sensible  to bear in mind the position  and 
possible  reaction  of the consumer  whenever  price measures  are being 
contemplated.
(b) U.K. market
The U.K. market  is of paramount  importance  to the Irish dairy indus ­
try. Ireland  has a comparative  advantage  over all other E.E.C.  countries  
(except  the U.K. itself) because  of :
— Physical  proximity  and therefore  lower  transport  costs;
— Acceptability  of types and quality  of product;
— Lengthy  establishment  in the market  and the substantial  marketing  
investments  made over the past 10/15 years.
It is clearly a top priority  market. Given the above advantages,  if 
Ireland  cannot  win in the U.K. market,  her prospects  in other markets  
must be less favourable.  Therefore,  trends  in the U.K. dairy scene are 
worthy  of the closest  study and the main points  are summarised  below.
Butter and cheese prices are estimated  to rise by 44% and 33% 
respectively  (in real terms i.e. before allowing  for inflation)  over a five 
year period  (see Table  6). This will inevitably  be accompanied  by falling  
consumption,  especially  butter  (where  consumption  drops  may be estim ­
ated variously  from 12-25%  over the next five years) and, to a lesser  
extent,  liquid milk. Cheese  on the other hand has traditionally  been 
resilient  in the face of price rises. The summary  position  is that con­
sumption  of milk products  as a whole is expected  to drop by 13% over 
the next five years.
Increased  milk production  is now official  U.K. Government  policy  and, 
from the U.K. point of view, makes  sound  economic  sense. One impor ­
tant factor is that since the liquid sector is expected  to decline,  all 
additional  milk produced  will be available  for manufacture  and therefore  
a relatively  inocuous  annual  production  increase  of say 3% could, in 
fact, mean  an increase  in output  of manufactured  products  of 10%. Table  
8 sets out some projections  of possible  U.K. production  levels in the 
coming  years. It shows  that total U.K. milk production  may increase  by 
15% over the next six years,  that liquid milk consumption  may decline 
by 5% and that milk available  for manufacture  may consequently  in­
crease  by 44%.

farmhouse  production.
The British  economy  has been in recession  for four years and seems  
likely to remain  so at least for a further  three. One of the consequences  
of this is the phenomenon  of “trading-down ”. Price becomes  of para ­
mount importance  to the consumer  and he reacts against  paying  extra  
for premium  brands  or expensive  packaging.
In a shrinking  market  with rising domestic  production,  the continued  
presence  of New Zealand  produce  in guaranteed  quantities  and at prices  
which  are contrived  for the sale of those guaranteed  quantities,  becomes  
more difficult.
The combined  operation  of all these factors is already  leading  to 
tough situations  especially  in the butter and cheese  markets.  In Tables  
9 and 10 I have attempted  to demonstrate  the potential  market  situations.
Ireland  will be at a comparative  disadvantage  to the U.K. and New 
Zealand;  to the U.K. because,  prices  being  equal,  there will be a tendency  
towards  consumer  preferences  for the domestic  product  especially  in the 
case of cheese;  to New Zealand  because  of “guaranteed ” stated  quantities  
of produce  in the market. There  will be an intensely  competitive  situa ­
tion among  the E.E.C.  partners,  for a shrinking  proportion  of a shrinking  
market. On butter,  for instance,  we could find that countries  such as 
Denmark,  Netherlands,  France,  Germany  and Ireland,  who have recently  
sold between  them up to 300,000  tons annually  of butter in the U.K.,  
will now be competing  for a market  sector  potentially  as low as 83,000  
tons.
In cheese,  principally  Cheddar  cheese,  Ireland  has, apart from U.K. 
production  and the guaranteed  New Zealand  quantities  an advantage  
over the other E.E.C.  countries  in that the quality  of Irish cheese  is more

acceptable  to the U.K. market.  Nevertheless,  we could again  find a group  
of countries  (Ireland,  Denmark,  France,  Germany  and Holland)  who 
recently  have shipped  as much as 110,000  tons annually  to U.K., now 
competing  for a market  sector  of 80,000  tons.
The inevitable  consequence  of this intense  competition  in butter and 
cheese  markets  will be lower  price returns.
(c) Skimmed  milk powder  exports
The importance  to Ireland  of skimmed  milk powder  exports  is demon ­
strated  by the value of exports  in 1975. It is particularly  important  to 
preserve  alternatives  to intervention  sales. In so doing, over the past 
three years, Ireland has performed  an important  service not only to 
Irish producers  but to all E.E.C.  producers.  Nevertheless,  the best efforts 
in this respect  will be hampered  by chronic  imbalances  in world supply 
and demand  which now manifests  themselves  in world prices around  
$350 per ton for a product  which  costs the E.E.C.  up to $1,200  per ton 
to produce.  We clearly  have an interest,  therefore,  in the restoration  of 
world equilibrium  in this commodity.
(3) Prices
From the foregoing  analysis,  I consider  it unlikely  that market  buoy ­
ancy can be expected  to contribute  positively  to the development  of 
prices over the next 3/5 years. If anything,  the reverse  is true. I have  
already  pointed  out that U.K. market  returns,  especially  for butter  may 
turn out to be less than intervention  equivalent.
However,  there are three other possible  sources  of price increase  avail ­
able to Irish producers  ;
(i) Two remaining  transitional  .stages (1.4.77  and 1.1.78)  which would  
both be quite small, would refer to butter  only and would  amount  
to about 2% increase.
(ii) The size of Annual  Review  increases  is anybody ’s guess but given  
the growing  recognition  of structural  imbalance  and the high stock 
situation  it seems  possible  that the increases  will be low rather  than 
high, say 3-4% annually.
(iii) There still remains  approximately  11% to be gained  for Irish pro­
ducers  by Green Pound  devaluation.
It must also be considered  that market prices do not and will not 
necessarily  move with intervention  prices  and that there will be unavoid ­
able increases  in transport,  labour  and selling  costs.
Quite clearly,  all economies  must be sought  in order to pass back to 
producers  a maximum  proportion  of what will be, after all, relatively  
modest  increases.
Producer  prices in Ireland  in the period 1972-5  increased  by 90% (in 
sterling  terms). It is perfectly  clear that unit price increases  of that mag­
nitude  are behind  us, and it would  be wise to concentrate  on the expan ­
sion of production  as a means  of raising  farm income  in the coming  years. 
This would be also a good defence  against  the forthcoming  competitive  
situation.  It is worth noting  that the New Zealand  system  of high yield 
and herd sizes/low  costs and prices has enabled  her to win a dispropor ­
117
tionately  high share of world  trade and to retain  it in recent  years  against  
all the odds.
(4) Summary —analysis  and projections
Table 6 showed  the product  output  arising  from milk production  and 
indicated  an annual  increase  of about  8% in volume.  I then assumed  a 
domestic  market  showing  a slight reduction  in liquid consumption,  an 
initial  reduction  and then a recovery  in butter  consumption  and a steadily  
rising  cheese  consumption.  Substracting  one from the other  gives  an idea 
of the order  of magnitude  of products  available  for export. These  figures  
are quite substantial  and show that on a weighted  milk-equivalent  basis, 
the quantity  of products  available  for export  will almost  double  in the 
next six years.
For major export markets  Table 9 summarises  trends in U.K. con­
sumption  of butter,  U.K. domestic  production  of butter  and imports  of 
New Zealand  butter,  together  with the quantities  of Irish butter  available  
for export. The position  is hardly  encouraging.  It shows  that by 1980 
total U.K. consumption  may be 333,000  tons, U.K. domestic  production  
and New Zealand ’s imports —250,000  tons, leaving  a remaining  market  
sector of 83,000  tons to be supplied  by all other E.E.C.  countries.  In 
that year, Ireland  alone may have 101,000  tons available  for export.  
Apart from demonstrating  the obvious  difficulty  of the U.K. market,  
these figures  also emphasise  the increasing  importance  of non-U.K.  butter  
trade which  has been built up in recent  years.
Trends  for cheese  exports  are projected  on Table 10. The key factors  
are the exclusion  of New Zealand  cheese  and the relative  acceptability  of 
the Irish product.  By 1980 a total U.K. consumption  of 340,000  tons is 
predicted  with domestic  production  of 252,000  tons leaving  a balance  to 
be supplied  by all other  E.E.C.  countries  of 88,000. In that year, Ireland  
may have about 60,000  tons to export. Thus, we require  68% of the 
non-U.K.  sector to fulfil our needs as opposed  to 51% in 1976, not at 
all an impossible  task.
The position  on skimmed  milk powder,  in world  markets,  is practically  
impossible  to quantify.  There will be greatly  increased  quantities  avail ­
able for export and market  expertise  and customer  contracts  built up 
over the past 8-10 years will enable  Ireland  to perform  better  than most  
other exporting  countries.  However,  whether  such export  sales will pro­
vide a return  better  than the alternative  (intervention),  or whether  indeed 
intervention  will continue  to be an alternative,  are outside  our control,  
depending  as they do on the world supply  and demand  situation  and on 
policies  and export  subsidies  emanating  from Brussels.
Conclusions
The foregoing  analysis  suggests  a number  of courses  of action —inter ­
national  policies,  E.E.C.  institutional,  the market  place and finally  within 
our own industry.
1. International  policies
The development  of world markets,  co-operation  with developing  
countries  and development  of Food Aid programmes  is a matter  much
118
more of politics  than of economics.  The successful  sale of ever-growing  
quantities  of skim powder  on world markets  depends,  apart from the 
level of export subsidies  from E.E.C.,  on the level of world demand,  
which  in turn is greatly  influenced  by the development  of the above  men­
tioned  programmes.  Naturally  Ireland ’s voice in international  politics  is 
not nearly  so great as her need for action on this front, and the best 
course,  therefore,  may be to press the E.E.C. political  machine  into 
action. The development  of world  markets  and co-operation  with under  
developed  countries  together  with the evolution  of efficient  channels  for 
food aid programmes  is a long and wearisome  task but it is one which  
falls within  the scope of the E.E.C. ’s foreign  policy  department  and this 
appears  to be the best route for embarking  on what is admittedly  a long 
unhill struggle.
2. Internal  E.E.C.  matters
As major beneficiaries  of the Common  Agricultural  Policy,  Ireland  
has a strong  interest  in its preservation.  This involves  the correction  of 
the structural  imbalance  which  exists internally  in E.E.C.  and proposals  
which cover both the supply  and demand  sides of the E.E.C.  milk bus­
iness should  be supported  in our own interest.
On the demand  side there are a number  of areas of E.E.C. milk 
consumption  which could benefit  from promotion  and advertising,  for 
instance,  liquid milk consumption  in the European  mainland,  butter  
consumption  in Holland  and cheese  consumption  in the U.K. and Ireland.
On the supply  side, there are various  schemes  proposed —reduction  of 
cow numbers  through  disease  eradication  programmes,  schemes  for non­
marketing  premia  and finally  the reduction  and eventual  disappearance  
of imports  from New Zealand.
Price could positively  affect  both supply  and demand.  It is in Ireland ’s 
particular  interest  that the balance  of milk supplies  be restored  by 
stabilisation  of E.E.C.  intervention  and target prices  over a period  long 
enough  to discourage  the marginal  producers  of milk in the Community.  
It is a fundamental  principle  of the Economic  Community  that goods 
should  be produced  where it is most economic  to do so. Even a slight 
application  of this old-fashioned  principle  should produce  tangible,  if 
peripherally  painful  results. Furthermore,  the price restraint  arising  from  
this would positively  aid consumption  of our products.  It is a subtle  
policy  worthy  of our deep consideration.
3. Measures  within  Irish industry
An analysis  of Ireland ’s present  position  has shown that there are 
difficult  times ahead. We should  recognise  that in the forthcoming  com­
petitive  situation  the country  which is most efficient  will be able to 
outstay  the others when the pressure  is on. This involves  seeking  in­
creased  efficiency  of our industry  at all levels —production,  processing  
and marketing.  On production  the path to increased  farm incomes  will 
in the future lie more readily  through  increased  output than through  
increased  unit prices. The question  of seasonality  of production  should
119
also be studied  and its effect  on the costs  of processing  should  be seriously 
examined.  At processing  level, we will require  the maximum  efficiency  
of management  decision-making  in regard to the allocation  of mi’k to 
products  (where  that option  exists)  and regarding  investment  in further  
processing  facilities  to meet expected  new levels of milk production.  
Furthermore,  the efficiency  of processing  costs,  together  with the season ­
ality aspect,  is a significant  part of the final cost of our products  and 
needs careful  examination.
In marketing  tasks, exporting  is now a distinct  skill in itse'f to take 
maximum  advantage  of the movement  and the forecast  movement  of 
MCA ’s and ACA ’s. This has been of the utmost  importance  over the 
past three years and will continue  to be so for the next year or two also. 
All the good work in other sectors  can be dissipated  by poor decisions  
in this.
More important,  there is probably  no substitute  for hard selling. It is 
good to note that the four companies  marketing  Irish cheese  in the U.K.  
are about  to embark  on a major  joint promotional  campaign  financed  by 
Irish cheese  manufacturers.  The logistics  of distribution  costs have to be 
continually  scrutinised  and sales promotional  programmes  examined  for 
their effectiveness.  Product  and packaging  improvements  must be under ­
taken in the knowledge  that it is a buyers ’ market  for the foreseeable  
future.
4. Financial  policy
Producers  can be aided by devaluation  of the Irish Green Pound rate 
down to its real level but accompanying  this by appropriate  increases  in 
domestic  food subsidies  in order  to protect  consumption  levels in Ireland.
5. Markets
We must preserve  and develop  our own market,  not alone by promo ­
tional and advertising  means but most importantly,  by putting our 
products  on the market  at prices which the consumer  can afford.
We have an interest  in the preservation  of the total size of the U.K.  
market  and in the maintenance,  in particular,  of butter  consumption  at 
its present  levels. The interest  of the U.K. Government  (lower  consumer  
prices)  and of the E.E.C.  (high  dairy  products  consumption)  are identical. 
We should  make  every  effort  to reconcile  these interests.  Once consump ­
tion is lost, it will cost twice as much to win it back as it would have 
done to maintain  it in the first place.
We have an interest  in the exclusion  of New Zealand  butter  and cheese  
from the U.K. market  totally. We should  seek to ensure  that after 1978 
New Zealand  retains  no rights in the cheese  market  and that its rights in 
the butter  market  be reduced  to the lowest  possible  figure.
Retaining  our share of a declining  market  will be hard work. We must  
recognise  that while the U.K. economy  is in recession  what matters  most 
is the price of our products  on the counter,  and all on-costs  must be 
reviewed  in this light. We can preserve  and expand  our market  share 
only by aggressive  selling  and ruthless  cost-cutting.

Irish dairy farmers  have responded  well to reasonable  market  assurance  
and to a reasonable  price structure,  in the form of a cumulative  20% 
more milk in just two years. A recent prediction  by An Bord Bainne  
indicates  that on the evidence  available  we will have nationally  approx ­
imately  900 million  gallons  of manufacturing  milk in 1981 (Table 1).

1980 1.210 700 847 + 4.1
1981 1.241 710 881 + 4.0
It is against  this background  that we must pose the question  of where 
the industry  is going and what shape it should  take in the next five years 
and onwards.  The figure for growth  in production  is based on perform ­
ance in recent years, projected  five years ahead. It is subject  to certain  
risks that could alter the pattern dramatically,  i.e. a limit on E.E.C.  
intervention  such at the 50% imposed  on beef sales would change  the 
whole course of Irish dairy farming. Even a mild restriction  of the 
present  intervention  system would have a profound  effect. The funda ­
mentals  of the C.A.P.  must be maintained  intact. It is essential  to the 
survival  and development  of the Irish dairy industry.
It is my belief that the projection  referred  to is realistic  and it is 
certainly  the best indicator  available.  It is a measurement  against  which 
plans in the next few years must be made. We must begin now in the 
knowledge  that the 675 million gallons produced  in 1976 caused a 
squeeze  in many creameries  in the peak weeks. We should have 730 
million  gallons  coming  up in 1977.
At the same time we do not need and cannot  afford the upheaval  of 
a full phase of nationwide  plant building,  especially  if it is limited  to 
butter  and skim milk powder.  More than ever we need planned  rational  
expansion.
121
At this stage 1 wish to make three points  :
1. Production  and processing  facilities  are now near enough  matched.  ^
2. More investment  will be needed  in the industry  which  must he paid  
for from the gallon  of milk.
3. We must not waste scarce  and costly  resources  in unnecessary  dupli ­
cation  of plant or effort.
Since the emergence  of large scale amalgamation  Co-ops.  there has 
been pressure  to pay out the last penny  for milk. Perhaps  there was need  
for some pressure  to pave the way for a good rationalization  programme  
as a second  phase  to the change  to bigger  creamery  organisations.  Now 
the time has come perhaps  to lift the pressure,  to take the emphasis  off 
the short term and to think of the comparatively  long term planning  
which  the dairy industry  needs.
It is not very difficult  or very clever  to produce  butter  and skim milk 
powder  without  considering  all the other possibilities.  In 1973 we put 
65% of our milk into those products.  In 1976, and not without  reason,  
that figure rose to 75%. If 900 million  gallons  are produced  without  
doing something  serious  about our product  mix, then we are clearly  
moving  to a ridiculous  dominance  of two products  whose future is 
inseparable  for intervention  buying.
At a recent  Co-op.  dairy convention  in the U.S. I was very interested  
to hear that the U.S. now has approximately  40% of the 1963 level of 
skim milk powder  production.  The attitude  to declining  butter  consump ­
tion appears  amazingly  casual. It is looked upon as a by-product  of 
skim milk piowder  and the general  approach  is to restrict  its production  
according  to the requirements  of a declining  skim milk powder  market.  
That is a surprising  turnabout.
The apparent  change  in attitude  in the U.S. is no more radical  than 
that in the Irish dairy industry  during  the same period. We have moved 
from an industry  of hundreds  of small creameries  returning  skim to a 
rationalised  one. Six societies  now handle  60% of the milk and no skim  
return. These facts indicate  the rate of change  in the industry  and we 
must not be unduly  worried  about  change.
A'so, in the U.S. added  emphasis  has been given to the role of many  
of the products,  in particular  to cheese. I believe  that we must do like­
wise, not in the light of comparative  returns  this year but in the long 
term. To date there has been more than adequate  capacity  for cheddar  
cheese  (this does not mean that we may have additional  capacity).  In my 
view one or two good factories  for the manufacture  of Gouda,  Emmen-  
thal and Gruyere,  and possibly  other types are needed. But we don ’t 
need six Gouda  factories.  Plants  to produce  other specialised  products  
are required,  but not too many.
The problem  is that the right factory  for tomorrow  may have to 
struggle  a little today. Who is to have the prospect  of them,  even if the 
good prospect  contains  an element  of early risk ? The question  must be 
answered  by farmers. The shareholders  and milk producers  of Irish 
Co-op  creameries  will have to declare  their intent  and give their support  
to rational  planning  for a long term product  mix. It is not the task for 
Co-op.  management,  nor indeed  for any one Co-op.,  although  I believe
122
much can be achieved  by co-operation  between  neighbouring  Co-ops.  It 
is no easy or simple  task and it requires  a national  blueprint.
Cheese  production  is the major  bright  spot in the dairy  industry.  World  
consumption  is increasing  annually.  It is estimated  that cheese  produc ­
tion will use 40% of total milk production  in 1984. Traditionally  cheese  
trading  has taken place between  developed  nations  and this is likely to 
continue  for some time, but in a modified  way.
Improving  the product  range should open up some prospects  in the 
European  market  for European  type cheeses.  In the Third  World  chronic  
hunger  and poverty  exists. It helps very little to give milk powder  to 
people  who have inadequate  facilities  to use it properly.  Would  it be 
easier to offer such people  cheese in a suitable  form and help them to 
appreciate  nourishing  qualities  ? I am no expert  on the Third World,  
but it would  appear  sensible  in time to try such an approach,  despite  the 
storage,  freight  and climatic  problems  of these countries.
The industry  must find out through  practical  product  development  and 
market  research  what is required  and where requirements  can be chan ­
ged. With the support  of the industry,  I believe  that the responsibility  for 
this work can be placed  in the hands  of a body such as An Bord Bainne.  
It may be necessary  to provide  better financial  and technical  assistance  
in certain  market  areas where  obvious  potential  exists.
From a processing  point of view, 1 wish to point out what is required  
from producers  :
1. There has been substantially  increased  production  in the past two 
years. It will best serve the interests  of the industry  and nation to 
maintain  this trend. Our future lies in continued  efficient  expansion  
with more and better  use of grass and obviously  with improved  farm
incomes.
2.
3.
4.The industry  needs  high quality  raw material,  both compositional  and 
bacteriological.  High quality  products  are essential  at any time, but 
never more essential  than in times of surplus.  We are in a period  of 
scarcity,  not moving  towards  one.
An improvement  in the peak to valley  ratio is required.  The current  
one of 16:1 for manufacturing  milk has very severe limitations  of 
planning  an extended  product  range.
There should  be an understanding  that some of the suggested  devel ­
opments  would  result  in a movement  away from intervention  products  
and possibly  for brief periods  a slightly  reduced  milk price. We can 
be cavalier  about  the whole  matter  in that we produce  only four per 
cent of E.E.C. ’s milk total, so why be concerned  ? We must be con­
cerned  because  milk production  is important.  We must avoid blatant  
abuse of the intervention  mechanism  because  it is needed.  If we act 
wrongly  in the long term our vital industry  is left in a very vulnerable  
situation.
In the light of these basic requirements,  what can the industry  at 
processing  and marketing  level offer farmers  in future  ?
In return  the industry  can offer, and reasonably  guarantee,  such secur ­
ity as will allow farmers  to engage  in confident  development  of their  
dairy enterprises.

Summary
Alternative  methods  of inducing  superovulation  in donor beef heifers 
were examined  in an attempt  to recover  a high number  of transferable  
eggs, the incidence  of egg abnormalities  increased  substantially  when 
recovery  from the reproductive  tract was delayed  beyond  day 4. Cattle  
eggs stored  singly  in 0.5 ml. capacity  Cassou  straws  for 2-6 hours  at 30°C 
developed  satisfactority  on transfer  to the rabbit  oviduct  to assess  viabil- 
ity. The effect of temperature  on the outcome  of transfer  attempts  in 28 
recipient  cattle was examined;  embryo  survival  rate was higher when 
temperature  was controlled  at 30°C than when transfer  was performed  at 
ambient  temperature  (38% vs 8% survival).  Five transfer  calves were  
born to 12 cattle that each received  a single egg one week after mating  
(44% twinning  rate in cattle conceiving).

OESTRUS  SYNCHRONISATION  IN GILTS  USING  A SYNTHETIC  
PROGESTOGEN  A-35957  AND  INSEMINATED  WITH  FRESH  OR
FROZEN  SEMEN
P. J. O’REILLY
Department  of Agriculture,  A.I. Research  Unit, Ballycoolin  Road,  
Ring  las, Dublin  11.
Forty-eight  gilts were divided  into three groups  matched  on a weight 
basis. Group  1 received  no compound  and group  2 and 3 were fed the 
compound  at a rate of 12.5 and 15 mg per pig per day as a premix  for 
19-21 days. As the gilts came into oestrus  half of each group  were in­
seminated  with fresh and the other half frozen  semen. Half of the gilts 
inseminated  with fresh and frozen  semen  were operated  on 2-4 days after 
the end of oestrus  and ova recovered.  These  were examined  for cleavage,  
presence  of sperm  and numbers  of sperm  in the zona pellicuda.  The other  
half were slaughtered  after 30 days if they failed to return  to heat and 
the numbers  of embryos  and corpora  lutea in the reproductive  tract  
enumerated.  Those returning  to oestrus  were re-inseminated.  No sig­
nificant  difference  between  groups  was found in the duration  of oestrus  
which for group 1, 2 and 3 respectively  were 54.9 ± 7.8, 58.9 ± 17.6, 
53.6 + 15 hours. The interval  from the commencement  of treatment  to 
the onset of oestrus  was significantly  different  between  control  and both 
treated  groups,  and was respectively  11.6 ± 7.8, 5.8 ± 1.2, 7.3 ± 5.3 days. 
There was no significant  difference  in the proportion  of eggs cleaved  in 
the treated  and control  groups  but fresh semen  yielded  significantly  more  
cleaved  ova than frozen  semen. The gilts inseminated  with frozen  semen 
from one of the boars yielded  significantly  more cleaved  ova than those 
from three other boars. The proportion  of gilts pregnant  30 days after  
insemination  and average  litter size in each of the three groups  insemin ­
ated with fresh and frozen  semen  were respectively  for Group  1 1/3,11;  
0/3,0; Group  2 2/3, 11.5; 1/3, 7, and Group  3 1/2, 11; 0/3, 0. The 
proportion  of gilts pregnant  after repeat  insemination  with fresh  or frozen  
semen  and average  litter size were respectively  for gilts which  had been 
previously  operated  upon 3/7, 10; 1/6, 10; and for those which  returned  
to oestrus  but were not operated  on 2/5, 6; 2/5, 7.

OVULATION  RATE  AND CALVING  RATE  FOLLOWING  THE
USE OF PMSG  OR Gn-RH  IN POST-PARTUM  BEEF  COWS
J. M. SREENAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuani,  Co. Galway.
Output  in the suckler  herds could be increased  by
(a) The use of artificial  insemination  to introduce  sires of the Continental  
breeds  (Charolais,  Limousin,  Simmental).
(b) By increasing  the calf crop, both by increasing  the number  of cows  
in calf and by inducing  twinning  in a proportion  of those.
One possible  method  of allowing  artificial  insemination  and increasing  
the calf crop is the use of oestrus  synchronization  (induction)  combined  
with follicular  stimulation.
In this study both PMSG  and Gn-RH  (analogue  Hoe 766) have been  
studied.  In heifers  PMSG  doses  of 0, 500, 750 and 1000 i.u. have resulted  
in ovulation  rates of 0.9 + 0.6; 2.2 + 0.3; 3.1 ± 0.7; 5.3 ± 1.4. Following  
the dose of 500 i.u., 93% of the heifers  had between  one and four ovu­
lations. Gn-RH  was studied  in heifers  in doses ranging  from 10 to 50 
Mg and while it effected  a peak discharge  of LH it reduced  ovulation  rate 
at most of the rates studied.
In post partum  beef cows fertility  was studied  following  dose rates of 
0 and 750 i.u. of PMSG  in conjunction  with a progestagen  sponge  syn­
chronization  treatment.  This resulted  in an increase  in calving  rate from  
53% to 72% with a 20% twinning  rate in the PMSG  treated  group.
Further  studies  arc continuing  on the effect of varying  PMSG  dose 
rates at varying  stages  post partum.
Data on ovulation  rate and timing,  LH release  and timing  and fer­
tility will be presented  in relation  to PMSG  or Gn-RH  treatments.

NON SURGICAL  RECOVERY  AND TRANSFER  OF BOVINE
EMBRYOS
J. M. SREENAN  and T. McDONAGH  
Agricidtuml  Institute.  Belclare,  Tuani.  Co. Galway.
The success  of bovine  egg transfer  as a breeding  technique  depends  
ultimately  on being able to use a total non-surgical  approach.  The pre­
sent communication  deals with a study of factors  affecting  non-surgical  
recovery  and transfer  of bovine  ova.
1. Non-surgical  recovery
Method  of recovery  used was a 3-way (Foley type) plastic catheter.  
This catheter  is passed  through  the cervix  with the aid of a stillete  which 
is withdrawn  when the catheter  is as far forward  in the uterine  horn as 
possible.  Following  cuff inflation,  about 100-150  ml of recovery  medium  
(physiological  saline) is then introduced  by gravity  feed and finally re­
covered  from the outlet lumen.
Recovery  rate was higher  with a 70 cm long catheter  (53%)  than with 
a 30 cm catheter  (27%). Higher  recovery  rates were also obtained  at 
days 7-1-8 (41%)  than at days 5+6. Ovluation  rate also had an affect  
on recovery  rate with highest recovery  (47%) from single ovulating  
animals  and lowest  (11%)  from highly  stimulated  animals  with an ovu­
lation rate of > 11 (range 14 - 47). Parity status  did not affect recovery 
rate.
At days 7 -t- 8 recovery  rate with a 70 cm catheter  was similar  (41%)  
to surgical  recovery  (48%).
2. Non-surgical  transfer
Single egg non-surgical  transfers  were carried  out to either previously 
inseminated  or non-inseminated  recipients.  Following  transfer  at days 8 
and 9 to non-inseminated  recipients  (N = 10) an embryo  survival  of 60% 
was recorded.  Following  transfer  to previously  inseminated  recipients  a 
pregnancy  rate of 55% was obtained  with a twinning  rate (of pregnant  
recipients)  of 47%.
Higher  embryo  survival  was recorded  at days 8-1-9 than at 6 -t- 7 but 
the difference  here was not significant.
Data on embryo  recovery  and survival  following  transfer  will be pre­
sented in relation  to the various  factors  affecting  recovery  and survival  
rates.

EVALUATION  OF A SIMPLE  METHOD  FOR MEASURING  
PASTURE  DRY MATTER  PRODUCTION
D. McCarthy  and M. KEARNEY  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
In most situations  involving  grazing  animals  total pasture  output  is an 
unknown  quantity.  Methods  presently  used to measure  output  are time 
consuming  and not suitable  for use on commercial  fanns  or in advisory  
work. Hence,  there is need for a rapid method  for estimating  dry matter  
production.
A simple instrument  (‘Grassmeter ’)* was used for this purpose.  It 
comprised  an aluminium  base plate sliding  on a vertical  calibrated  bar, 
the reading  on the bar depending  on the amount  of grass beneath  the 
plate. During  the grazing  season (March  - November)  readings  were 
taken pre- and postgrazing  on rotationally  grazed permanent  pastures  
(21-day rotation).  The swards  were perennial  ryegrass  dominant,  stocked 
with dairy cows at the rate of one cow per 0.32 ha, and mean paddock  
size was 0.24 ha. Linear  regression  techniques  were used to correlate  
the mean reading  (15 observations)  for each paddock  with dry matter  
production  estimates  made by cutting  five sample  quadrats  to ground  
level.
Month  of year had a major  effect on the correlation.  For pre-grazing  
data the poorest  relationship  existed in mid-season  (July, r=0.41,  NS) 
but good correlations  were obtained  early (April,  r=0.94,  p>0.01)  and 
late (August,  r = 0.80, p>0.01)  in the growing  season. The overall  
mean coefficient  of variation  for ‘Grassmeter ’ readings  within  paddocks  
was 34%.

PASTURE  PRODUCTION  UNDER  GRAZING  
P. C. McFEELY
The Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
Direct  measurement  of herbage  production  in grazing  systems  is more  
relevant  in terms  of animal  production  potential  than extrapolation  from  
cutting  (‘simulated  grazing ’) experiments.  Herbage  production  was esti­
mated  in three trials by the pre- and post-grazing  difference  method  using  
a power-driven  sheep shearing  head for sampling.
In the first experiment  herbage  production  averaged  9450, 8800 and 
8150 kg DM/ha  at stocking  rates of 3.9, 5.5 and 7.1 cows/ha,  respec ­
tively during April/August  1972-74  (150-day  grazing  period). In the 
second experiment  total herbage  production  (March/November)  was 
12900  and 12700  kg DM/ha  in 1975 and 1976, respectively  at a stocking  
rate of 3.1 cows/ha.  In the third experiment  (March/November  1976)  
increasing  stocking  rate from 2.5 to 3.1 cows/ha  decreased  total herbage  
production  from 13750  to 12150  kg DM/ha.  In this series  of experiments  
the coefficient  of variation  ranged  from 12.5 to 28.1%.

ESTABLISHMENT  OF NEW SWARDS  BY DIRECT  DRILLING  
1. Effects  of drilling  two forms  of fertilizer  nitrogen
J. G. CROWLEY
The Agricultural Institute,  Oak Park, Carlow.
Direct  drilling  as a method  of crop establishment  offers many advan ­
tages over the plough  as a means  of establishing  a wide range of crops. 
If this technique  can be perfected,  then it would offer a worthwhile  
alternative  to undersowing.
It has been suggested  that direct drilled crops require  higher  N fer­
tiliser inputs than conventionally  grown crops to reach the same level  
of output. Many  operators,  using the Bettinson  3-D, drill nitrogen  along  
with the seed when sowing  grass. There is no experimental  evidence  to 
support  this practice.
In the Autumn  of 1975 two experiments  were carried  out on barley  
stubble  using the Bettinson  3-D direct drill machine.  The objective  was 
to measure  the effect of combine  drilling  two forms  of fertilizer  nitrogen  
on the establishment  and subsequent  yields of a number  of Italian  and 
perennial  ryegrass  varieties.
Experiment  1
In this experiment  C.A.N.,  26%N and Gold N, 32%N, a slow release 
nitrogen  fertilizer,  were drilled at two rates with the Italian varieties,  
Delecta  and Lemtal. The fertilizers  were drilled to supply equivalent  
amounts  of N as follows  :
126 kg/ha  of C.A.N.
102 kg/ha  of Gold N and 
252 kg/ha  of C.A.N.
204 kg/ha  of Gold N33 kg/ha  N as (a) 
(b)
66 kg/ha  N as (a) 
(b)
Experiment  2
In this experiment  the lower rate of N, 33 kg/ha  only, was drilled  as 
in Expt. 1. The varieties  used in this case were perennial  ryegrass  var­
ieties Cropper,  Spirit and Vigor. Plots drilled without  nitrogen  were  
used as controls.
For both experiments  yield data were recorded  in the spring and 
summer  of 1976.
The results  can be summarised  as follows  :
1. Drilling  C.A.N.  did not increase  the yields over that of the control.  
At 252 kg/ha  a slight reduction  in yield was recorded.
2. Drilling  the equivalent  amount  of N as “Gold N” did substantially  
increase  the output  in the following  spring.
3. The earlier  the variety  in spring growth  the higher the response  to 
the slow release  nitrogen.

THE ROLE  OF SULPHUR  IN LEGUME  NITROGEN  FIXATION  
AND CROP  QUALITY
C. MASTERSON
An Foras  Taluntais,  Johnstown  Castle,  Wexford.
Forage  crops have a relatively  high sulphur  requirement.  The element  
is known to be involved  in nitrogen  metabolism  in the plant but its 
function  in symbiotic  nitrogen  fixation has not been studied. This 
presentation  describes  the effect of added sulphur  on nitrogen  fixation 
by white  (cult. Blanca)  and red (cult. Hungaropoly)  clovers  in glasshouse 
experiments.  The results  show that sulphur  is specifically  important  for 
symbiotic  nitrogen  fixation.  When soil sulphur  was low, addition  of the 
element  gave highly  significant  increases  in plant yield,  and several  para ­
meters  of nitrogen  fixation  : nitrogen  fixation  per plant, nodule  weight 
per plant and per unit weight  of root and nitrogen  fixation  per unit 
weight  of nodule. The sulphur  content  of various  field grown forage  
crops, especially  legumes,  were examined.  The levels observed  reveal  
that red clover is very inefficient  in extracting  sulphur  from soil. It is 
also evident  that sulphur  levels and nitrogen-sulphur  ratios obtained  in 
these crops,  although  adequate  for plant  growth,  are seriously  inadequate  
for maximum  ruminant  feeding  value.
THE CHOICE  OF ANIMAL  TYPE IN CATTLE  GRAZING  
EXPERIMENTS
J. CONNOLLY
An Foras  Taluntais,  19 Sandymount  Avenue,  Dublin.
Grazing  experiments  are classified  into those in which the animal  is 
the object  of study and those in which  the animal  is used to assess  effects  
of treatments  on grassland  productivty.  For the latter exjteriments  it is 
shown that steers are statistically  much more efficient  than cows. Using 
statistics  from a number  of steer and cow grazing  experiments  it is shown  
that an experiment  using steers could produce  as precise  an estimate  of 
treatment  effects  on about one fifth of the area of an experiment  using  
cows.

CAUSES  OF PERINATAL  MORTALITY  IN PIGS  
C. O’BRIEN-LYNCH
An Foras  Taluntais.  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
A survey of perinatal  mortality  was undertaken  in the Moorepark  
herd in 1976. Data were obtained  relating  to 3623 piglets  born in 346 
litters  over a 10-month  period. Post mortem  examinations  were carried  
out on 853 piglets  representing  23.5% of all piglets  born. Of these 325 
were stillborn  and examination  showed  death to have occurred  pre- 
partum  in 43 cases and intra-partum  in 282 cases. A breakdown  of the 
major  causes  of mortality  shows  the following  :
Stillbirths  38.1%
Trauma  26.5%
Enteritis  12.7%
Starvation  6.1%
Inanition  5.2%
All other causes  11.4%
These data are being used as an aid in devising  a programme  of re­
search  into methods  of reducing  perinatal  mortality.

THE EFFECT  OF GROWTH  RATE AND OF SEGREGATION  
FROM  GILTS  ON THE STRENGTH  OF CARCASE  ODOUR  OF 
BOARS  KEPT  FOR MEAT  PRODUCTION
N. WALKER  and D. C. PATTERSON
In two experiments  littermate  pairs of boars  were grown  either  quickly  
or slowly  according  to pre-determined  weekly  target  live weights.  In the 
first experiment  subcutaneous  fat from 40 pairs of boars  was sampled  by 
biopsy  procedure  at a mean overall  live weight  of 85.5 ± 0.2 kg at which 
point the boars were either 150 ± 0.8 or 186 ± 0.8 days of age. In the 
second  experiment,  9 pairs of boars reached  121.0 ± 0.6 kg live weight 
at either 198 ± 0.9 or 267 ± 0.6 days of age and subcutaneous  fat was 
sampled  pre and post mortem.  In a third investigation  fat was sampled  
from commercially  produced  boars which had reached  bacon weight  in 
either less than 130 days or in more than 180 days. In all three experi ­
ments  the fast growing  boars had significantly  stronger  smelling  fat than 
the slow growing  boars.
Fat samples  were stored at — 18°C prior to odour evaluation  and 
although  storage time was confounded  with growth rate treatment  it 
appeared  to have no effect on odour  assessment.
Boars  penned  with gilts did not have depressed  growth  or feed conver ­
sion compared  with boars penned  in single sex groups. In one fattening  
house boars from mixed sex pens had significantly  stronger  smelling  fat 
compared  with boars from single sex pens although  post mortem  exam ­
ination  of ovaries  revealed  that none of the gilts in this part of the 
experiment  had reached  puberty.  In the second  fattening  house,  3 out of 
the 90 gilts on experiment  had ovulated,  all from mixed sex groups  but 
with no significant  effect  on the strength  of fat odour  of the boars.

METHOD  OF FEEDING  MILK TO CALVES
B. HENEGHAN,  P. O. BROPHY  and P. J. CAFFREY  
University  College,  Lyons.  Newcastle  P.O., Co. Dublin.
The object  of the work reported  was to compare  the effect of method  
of feeding  (open pail versus nipple)  milk replacer  to young calves on 
(a) performance,  (b) changes  in blood  glucose  and (c) behaviour.
Performance  was not significantly  influenced  by method  of feeding.  
Changes  in blood glucose  following  feeding  tended  to be greater  in the 
nipple fed calves but in general  differences  failed to reach significance.  
The data on blood glucose  changes,  however,  indicate  that the con­
dition  of ‘milk bloat ’ which  occasionally  develops  when milk is fed from  
an open pail may be alleviated  by reverting  to nipple-feeding.  Both water  
and concentrate  intake tended  to be higher  in the open-pail  fed calves 
than in the nipple  fed calves.
PELVIC  MEASUREMENTS  AND DYSTOKIA  IN COWS  
AND HEIFERS
O. H. LANGLEY
Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
Pelvic measurements  were made in two- and three-year  old heifers  
and mature  Friesian  cows using a Litton  hydraulic  pelvic meter. Meas ­
urements  were made on 144 two year old heifers,  95 three year old 
heifers  and 19 mature  cows. The pelvic  cross sectional  area was obtained  
by multiplying  the height and width measurements,  and this area was 
compared  with the weight  of the calf and ease of calving. The ease of 
calving  was graded from one for unassisted  calving,  to four for very 
difficult  calvings.
As calving  difficulty  increased  there was a tendency  for the pelvic  
area to decrease  and calf weight  to increase  within each age category.  
Pelvic area in two year old heifers  averaged  250, 237, 239 and 233 sq 
ems for animals  with grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 calving  difficulty  categories  
respectively.  Similar  values  for three year old heifers  were 287, 286, 289 
and 274 sq ems and for cows they were 310, 293, 294 and 289 sq cms. 
Calf weights  increased  from 34 to 39 kg in 2 year old heifers  having  grade  
I and grade 4 ease of calving  respectively.  In three year old heifers  the 
weights  were 37 and 42 kg and in cows 35 and 44 kg.
The relative  size of the calf to the size of the maternal  pelvis is thus 
a major factor in determining  ease of calving. The cow will tend to 
regulate  calf size according  to her own size, but such factors  as feeding 
system,  sire and breed of sire probably  reduce  the effectiveness  of this 
natural  regulation.

FACTORS  WHICH  AFFECT  CALF  PRICE  AT AUCTION
MARKETS
R. J. FALLON
Af^ricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
A survey  was conducted  in spring 1976 at six calf auction  markets  in 
the counties  of Cork and Limerick.  A total of 2,850  calves  were recorded  
of which 50% were Friesian  (Fr) males and 30% Fr females,  8.6% 
Hereford  X Friesian  (H X Fr) males and 9.7% H X Fr females. All 
other calves accounted  for 11.7%. Beef breed crosses namely  H X, 
H X Fr and Charolais  X (Ch) had a significant  price advantage  over 
Friesian.  The respective  mean price for Fr, H X Fr, H X and Ch X 
males  was £34, £48, £44 and £60. The mean  liveweights  for these crosses  
were 48, 50, 48 and 54 kg and for every kg increase  or decrease  in 
liveweight,  the calf price changed  by £2.10, £2.20,  £1.70 and £2.50 re­
spectively.  Chest girth of calf (cm) had a significant  effect on calf price  
(£): 70-75 cm—£19.60  ± 7.90, 80-85 cm— £36.60  + 10.80, 90-95 cm— 
£53.90  ± 6.90. Visual  condition  score was also an important  determinant  
of price : poor —£20.90  ± 9.80, fair—£29.60  ± 10.10 and good —£4..30  ± 
11.50. The assessment  of calf age used was a poor determinant  of priee : 
0 to 1 week— £25.50  ± 11.50,  2 to 3 weeks—£37.40  + 11.80,  4 to 5 weeks 
—£43.00  + 13.80. A priee differential  existed  between  auction  marts  and 
this was due to size of calf and to age of calf.

COMPARISON  OF HOLSTEINS  AND FRIESIANS  FOR MILK  
AND BEEF  PRODUCTION  — PRELIMINARY  RESULTS
G. J. MORE  O’FERRALL,  E. P. CUNNINGHAM,  T. M. O’BYRNE  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
Twenty-one  in calf Holstein  heifers  were imported  from Canada  in 
December  1974 in conjunction  with Waterford  Co-Op. A specially 
selected  comparable  group of 26 Pedigree  and 25 Commercial  in calf 
Irish Friesian  heifers  were assembled  and the groups  were managed  as 
one herd in 1975 and 1976. In 1975 the herd was run on the Institute ’s 
newly  reclaimed  hill farm at Coolnakilla  with no supplementation  during  
the grazing  season. In 1976 the herd was transferred  to Waterford  Co- 
Op’s farm at Castlelyons;  all animals  received  a supplementation  of 8 lb 
concentrates/hd/day  during  the grazing  season.
In 1975 the heifers  calved  at an average  age of just under  2^ years at 
average  weights  of 950 lb, 990 lb and 938 lb for Holstein  (H), Pedigree  
(P) and Commercial  (C), respectively.  The milk yields  adjusted  for date 
of calving,  the fat % and protein  % were 597 gal, 3.7%,  3.3%,  558 gal, 
3.7%,  3.5% and 551 gal, 3.5% and 3.4% for H, P and C, respectively. 
This gave the Holsteins  a 7% superiority  in milk yield. The correspond ­
ing yields  of milk, fat % and protein  % for 1976 were 1093 gal, 3.8%,  
3.4%, 963 gal, 3.85%,  3.6% and 899 gal, 3.7% and 3.5% for 14 H. 16 
P and 19 C cows respectively.  Thus the Holsteins  yielded  13% more 
milk (10% more fat) than the Pedigree  which  in turn yielded  7% more  
milk than the Commercials.
A group  of 30 twenty-month  old Friesian  steers —14 sired by Irish, 6 
by Canadian  Holstein  and 10 by New Zealand  bulls —were slaughtered  
in November  1976. One side of each carcass  was broken  down into 
commercial  wholesale  cuts. Compared  with the Irish sired group,  the 
Holsteins  had significantly  higher  % tail of rump  and % bone and lower 
% cube roll, front shin and leg width;  New Zealand  sired animals  had 
significantly  higher  % bone and lower % rump and brisket. These pre­
liminary  results on relatively  small numbers  indicate  that Iri.sh sired  
cattle were better  for beef merit.

PRELIMINARY  STUDY  ON THE GRAZING  BEHAVIOUR  OF
DAIRY  COWS
R. K. WILSON,  E. P. CUNNINGHAM  and G. J. MORE  O’FERRALL  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
Over 2 years grazing  behaviour  of cows within a herd composed  of 
Holstein.  Pedigree  Friesian  and Commercial  Friesian  was studied.  During  
the 1975 grazing  season  the cows were located  on a hill farm and were 
allowed  to graze ad libitum  in 2 ha ryegrass  type pastures,  except  for 
two short periods,  morning  and evening  for milking.  The animals  were  
moved  to fresh pasture  every 2 days. During  1976 the animals  were on 
a lowland  farm with permanent  pasture  (approx.  4 ha-plots).  The animals  
were moved  to fresh pasture  when the supply  of grass for grazing  was 
exhausted.
During  1975 eating  behaviour  was recorded  by radio telemetry  which 
gave the times spent eating,  ruminating  and resting. In 1976 Vibracor-  
ders were used which recorded  the times the animal ’s head was in a 
grazing  position.
The average  times spent eating,  resting  and ruminating  (13 cows) in 
1975 were 7.5 + 0.9, 5.6 ± 2.1 and 10.9 ± 1.9 and grazing  times m 1976 
were Holstein  (39), 9.5 ± 1.5 Pedigree  Friesian  (34), 8.7 ± 1.5 and Com ­
mercial  Friesian  (19), 9.4 + 1.2. When the grazing  time of the Holsteins  
was compared  with either  of the other  breeds  on a paired  basis the means  
were, Holsteins  9.5; others  9.2 (N.S.).
Milk yield was not related  to grazing  time (r = 0.22N.S.)  in either  year. 
Diurnal  variation  in eating throughout  the average  day was virtually  
identical  for the three breeds. In general  eating  commenced  with sunrise  
and finished  shortly  after sunset,  in 1976 some “mid-night ” grazing  was 
noted. The eating  times recorded  by Vibracorder  were about 100 min. 
greater  than those by radio telemetry  and this is in agreement  with the 
literature  on this topic.
Grazing  time as measured  by Vibracorders  is only one aspect  of the 
act of grazing  and bite size, bite frequency  and pasture  quality  have 
important  roles.

FARM  SIZE CONSTRAINTS  ON STOCKING  TARGETS  
ACHIEVABLE  IN IRELAND
J. LEE
An Foras  Taluntais,  Johnstown  Castle,  Wexford.
Land quality  varies  greatly  in Ireland.  This is illustrated  by the wide 
range of stocking  rates achieved  under experimental  conditions  at An 
Foras Taluntais  Research  Centres—from  approximately  136 to 296 live­
stock units (L.U.)  per 100 ha (55-120  L.U./lOO  acres). The amount  of 
land required  for an enterprise  of a given size will therefore  vary accord ­
ingly.
By taking into account  the size distribution  of holdings  on each soil 
association  in the country  and the capacity  of the soil for livestock  pro­
duction,  this study quantifies  the proportion  of holdings  technically  
capable  of supporting  four levels of stocking —20, 40, 60 and 100 L.U. 
The study shows  that on a national  scale,  63, 32, 19 and 7.5 per cent of 
holdings  are capable  of supporting  these four levels of stocking  respec ­
tively. These  figures  are compared  with the existing  herd size distribution  
pattern  on farms. A moderate  level of grassland  management,  which 
includes  an input of 48 kg N/ha,  is assumed.
Some of the results  show,  or instance,  that in those areas which  com­
bine best size distribution  of holding  and quality  of land 20 to 30 per 
cent of holdings  are technically  capaWe  of achieving  a target  of 100 L.U. 
whereas  in the poorer  areas less than 2 per cent are capable  of achieving  
this target. At a target of 40 L.U. Over 60 per cent of holdings  are 
capable  of achieving  a target  of over L.U. in the more favourable  regions  
whereas  the figure is less than 10 per cent in the most unfavourable  
regions.
Maps illustrating  the spatial  patterns  established  are included  and the 
various  implications  of the study are discussed.

INCREASED  LAMBING  FREQUENCY
J. JENNINGS  
M. J. LAWLOR
A/>riciiltural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
To improve  the efficiency  of sheep  production  it is necessary  to produce  
more lambs per ewe per year. To some extent this may be achieved  
genetically  by introducing  more prolific  breeds  or cross breeds.  Increased  
prolificacy  may also be achieved,  with considerable  advantage,  by in­
creasing  lambing  frequency.  The gestation  period of the sheep is 5 
months  but an average  of only 0.8 to 1.6 lambs per ewe are bom  
annually,  depending  on the breed of sheep and the environmental  con­
ditions,  e.g. hill or lowland.  The ewe is normally  non-pregnant  for seven  
of the 12 months  each year.
In a preliminary  trial to assess the effect of the two commercially  
available  hormone  preparations  (60 mg MAP and 30 mg Cronolone)  on 
fertility  in the post-partum  ewe, no significant  difference  was observed  
between  the treatments.  Subsequent  results  on the effect of weaning  on 
fertility  have shown  a significant  difference  between  continuous  suckling 
and weaning  lambs  2 days after birth. The results  of further  experiments  
have shown that the post-lambing  level of nutrition  has a considerable  
influence  on fertility.  In the case of ewes continuously  suckled  a lambing  
rate of 60-65%  has been obtained  by a high plane of feeding  from 
lambing  to mating  together  with hormone  treatment  at 8 weeks after 
lambing.
