Grass and Legume  Cultivars  to 
Maximise  Production  of High  
Quality  Silage

The scarcity  of silage  in Ireland  is aggravated  by its generally  poor qual ­
ity. The aim of this paper is to show how the use of bred cultivars  of 
grass and legume  herbage  species  when properly  managed,  can produce  
high yields of good quality  silage and consequently  improve  animal  per­
formance.
Grasses
Ryegrasses  are the mainstay  of reseeded  Irish pastures  and therefore,  
this paper  will be dealing  only with cultivars  of the three ryegrass  species.
The quality  assessment  of the ensiled  herbages  is based  on its in vitro  
digestibility.  This is measured  in terms of D-value,  which  is the percen ­
tage of in vitro digestible  organic  matter  in the total dry matter.
It is well known  that as grass grows  during  spring  and early summer,  
the yield of dry matter  increases  but the digestibility  falls. This fall is 
slow at first but reaches  about  0.4 digestibility  units per day as the grass 
matures.  The increase  in yield of dry matter  during  this period  may be 
100-200  kg per hectare  per day. Consequently,  a delay  of one week in the 
time of cutting  can produce  a considerable  deterioration  of the silage  
quality. As greater  emphasis  is being placed  on quality  the right time 
for cutting  is when the digestibility  of the herbage  reaches  67D value.
The average  date of first cut of 67-D herbage  varies  with the ryegrass 
species  and within  perennial  ryegrass  with the maturity  group  of the cul- 
tivar. Thus,  early and medium-early  cultivars  of perennial  ryegrass  should  
be harvested  between  20 to 25 May, medium-late  cultivars  on the first 
days of June, late types on the second  week in June and the very late, 
such as Endura  and Angela,  between  15 to 20 June. Cultivars  of Italian  
and hybrid  ryegrasses  should  be cut on 20-25 May. Regarding  tetraploid  
perennial  ryegrasses  the fall in digestibility  is slower  than in the diploid  
cultivars  and their digestibility  at heading  is higher  than that of diploid  
cultivars  with similar  date of heading.  Therefore,  the inclusion  of tetra ­
ploid cultivars  in mixtures  for conservation  is advisable.
There are some situations  in which a quality  level other than 67-D 
has to be adopted.  So, in dairy farms  which  aim at high milk production  
the herbage  ensiled  must have a D-value  not lower  than 70. There  is also 
the case in which it suits a farmer  best to cut a larger  bulk of moderate  
quality  silage and therefore  the 63-D level should  be more appropriate.  
The time of the first harvest  is affected  by weather  conditions.
Spring  grazing  reduces  the yield of the first silage cut and delays 
heading  and the date at which  a grass  reaches  a given  D-value.  The delay 
does not normally  exceed  a week  and depends  on the date when  the sward 
is closed  for silage. In areas of early spring  grazing  which  can be closed 
at the end of March  or first week of April the use of a mixture  based on 
early or medium-early  cultivars  is recommended.  This gives a first cut 
with a reasonably  high yield of good quality  silage at the end of May.  
When,  on the other hand, a pasture  cannot  be closed  until late April the 
use of medium-late  or late cultivars  is advisable.
Two large scale experiments  in which  ryegrass  cultivars  were assessed 
in terms  of silage  and beef production  have been carried  out at Oak Park  
and the results  are given in Tables  1 to 3.
Both trials were undersown  with barley,  the first in the end of March  
1970 and the second  at the beginning  of April 1975. In the first experi ­
ment an early and a medium-late  cultivar  of perennial  ryegrass.  Oriel and 
Spirit,  together with Lemtal  Italian  ryegrass,  were compared  under a 3-cut  
silage management.  In the second.  Oriel was replaced  by the medium- 
early cultivar,  Oakpark,  and the management  consists  of three cuts for 
the perennial  cultivars  and four cuts for Lemtal.  Nitrogen  inputs  of 280- 
325 kg N/ha per annum  were used in the first trial and 395 kg N/ha  are 
being applied  in the experiment  in progress.  Appropriate  amounts  of P 
and K per hectare  were spread  every  year.

Data on Tables 1 to 3 show how it is possible  to obtain  very high 
yields  of good quality  silage in the first harvest  when this is made at the 
right time and under  reasonable  weather  conditions.  Thus,  a delay  of the 
harvest  and unfavourable  weather  conditions  caused  a deterioration  of 
quality  of the first-cut  silage  of Spirit  in 1976 (Table  3).

Regarding  the subsequent  cuts the quality  of the silage  produced  de­
pends on the length of the regrowth  interval.  For Italian  ryegrass  the 
regrowth  periods  should  not exceed  4-5 weeks  (Tables  1, 2 and 3). As a 
result  of this shortening  of the regrowth  intervals  the number  of harvests  
has to be increased  from 3 to 4 (Table  3). This reduces  the total DM yield 
and in unfavourable  years as 1975 and 1976 the amount  of herbage  col­
lected in some cuts does not repay the high cost of harvest  and ensiling. 
For perennial  ryegrass,  6-7 week regrowth  intervals  are recommended  
to produce  reasonable  yields  of high quality  silage.
Early and medium-early  and medium-late  cultivars  of perennial  rye­
grass are suitable  for the 3-cut silage  system  of conservation.  The results  
obtained  with Spirit seem to indicate  that medium-late  cultivars  are the 
most appropriate  for this type of management,  however,  unusual  hot dry 
summers  can seriously  affect the third harvest.  Thus,  in 1976 a third har­
vest of Spirit  was not possible  (Table  3).
The use of pure swards  of Italian  ryegrass  for conservation  does not 
seem advisable  with a possible  exception  when a farmer  wants  to sow a 
very short ley of 12 to 18 months.  The results  of the experiments  show 
also that when Lemtal  is undersown  with a cereal crop its DM yield in 
the first harvest  season is lower than that obtained  when it is directly  
sown in the autumn.

The 3-cut  silage  management  has a depressing  effect  on the persistency 
of perennial  cultivars  and the yields  drop substancially  after four or five 
years.
The digestibility  of herbages  at the ensiling  time is usually  higher  than 
that of the corresponding  silages and the difference  depends  on the 
efficiency  of the conservation  process.  Thus, in the Oak Park experiments  
the digestibility  of the silage  was on average  2-4 units lower  but in badly 
preserved  silages  can be 10 units lower.
The overall  mean  of crude  protein  content  for the first cut silages  was 
9.9% which is lower than the 12% requirement  of most stock. Protein  
contents  of subsequent  cuts were higher  than the 12% level.
The ryegrass  silages  produced  in 1972 and 1973, and 1976 were tested 
in winter  feeding  trials in which Friesian  steers, averaging  447 kg live- 
weight,  were fed ad libitum  without  any supplementation.  The mean 
daily liveweight  gains obtained  were as follows :

Animals  fed silages  of higher  digestibility  performed  better  than those 
fed lower digestibility  silages  and the change  of management  of Lemtal  
swards  in the second  trial resulted,  as expected,  in a great improvement  
of the animal  performance.
Legumes  
White  clover
Although  white clover  is less important  as a herbage  legume  for con­
servation  than red clover and lucerne,  its role in grass/clover  swards  
under a grazing  and conservation  management  must not be underesti ­
mated. Apart  from supplying  nitrogen  to the sward,  this legume  retains  
a very high digestibility  of about 75-D over long periods  and the fall in 
digestibility  is much slower  than for the other two legumes  and for the 
ryegrasses.  Its crude protein  content  is also very high, normally  over 
20%. Therefore,  the quality  of the silage harvested  from a grass/clover  
sward will be improved  in proportion  to the amount  of white clover  
present.
The best cultivars  of white clover  are Blanca  and Kersey  but some ­
times it is difficult  to obtain  seed and its price is very high (£6.60  per kg). 
Cultivars  Sabeda,  Grasslands  Huia and Milkanova  can be used as alter ­
natives.
Red clover
The dramatic  increase  in the cost of nitrogen  caused  by the oil crisis 
and the world shortage  of protein  have brought  renewed  interest  in red 
clover  as a special  purpose  crop. This red clover  revival  was helped  by 
the fact that at this time plant breeders  have introduced  markedly  im­
proved new cultivars,  mostly tetraploids,  which are capable  of giving  
high yields when grown  pure or with a grass companion  without  use of 
fertiliser  N for 2-3 years. On the other hand advances  in the technology  
of silage  making  solved  the problems  of ensiling  red clover.
The best cultivars  presently  available  are the four tetraploid —Hun-  
garopoly.  Red Head,  Teroba  and Tetri. There  is no significant  difference  
in yield between  these cultivars  but Hungaropoly  is possibly  more per­
sistent  than the other three. These four cultivars  are resistant  to clover  
rot. In cases of seed scarcity  tetraploid  cultivars  can be replaced  by the
diploid  cultivars  Violetta,  Sabtoron  and Kuhn which give good yields  
particularly  in areas  free of clover  rot. Red clover  has a high crude  protein  
content  (16-18%)  and is also rich in minerals,  but has a low water  soluble 
carbohydrate  content  (8-12%).
High yields are dependent  on a satisfactory  crop establishment.  In 
direct  sowing  a fine tilth, a firm weed free seed bed and a soil pH of 6 to 
6.5 plus generous  application  of phosphorus  and potassium  are basic 
requisites  for good,  even establishment.  Under  Irish conditions  red clover 
or red clover/grass  mixtures  can be sown from April to the first week in 
August. The pure-sward  is very often open and susceptible  to weed in­
vasion,  but in red clover/grass  swards  the invasion  by weeds  is reduced. 
A good establishment  can be obtained  from sowing  red clover  under a 
cereal crop which  will be harvested  as arable  silage in July. A seed rate 
of 13-18 kg/ha  should  be used for a pure stand  and for a red clover/grass  
sward 13 kg of clover mixed with 6 kg of grass per hectare  should  be 
sown. Annual  fertiliser  requirements  are 40-60 kg of phosphorus  and 
200-300  kg of potassium  per hectare.
Although  yields  of DM as high as 12 t/ha per annum  can be obtained  
from pure stands  cut three times for silage,  the use of mixed  red clover/  
grass swards  is recommended.  The main advantages  of the mixed  sward 
are: a DM yield of 20-30%  higher  than in the pure clover sward,  the 
herbage  is easier to ensile, the presence  of a grass companion  reduces 
annual  weeds  and minimizes  the wheel  damage  to clover,  and the herbage 
is better  balanced  nutritionally  than in the pure sward.
Considering  the companion  grass,  Italian  ryegrass  is not recommended  
and the best choice  is a medium-late  perennial  ryegrass  cultivar  such as 
Spirit,  Talbot,  Barlenna,  Combi  and the tetraploids  Taptoe  and Barlatra.
The most appropriate  management  seems to be a first cut in early 
June followed  by two subsequent  cuts in early August  and late September  
respectively.
The D-value  of red clover at the time of the first silage harvest  is 
61-63D.  This low D-value  is acceptable  because  the intake  of red clover 
silage by stock is 20-40 per cent higher  than that of grasses  of the same 
digestibility  (Castle,  1975). Therefore,  silages  with 60-63D  and a high 
protein  content  are considered  of good quality. A 60D digestibility  is 
obtained  in second  and third cuts made with 6-week  regrowth  intervals.
The dry matter  content  of red clover  herbages  is normally  very low 
(12-14%)  and therefore,  they must be wilted to 23-25%.  The use of an 
additive  is essential  and Add-F.  containing  85% formic  acid, has been 
used elfectively  at rates of 2.3-4.5  1/t lifted material.
Regarding  the bloat hazard  it is not important  with red clover  silage  
as it is when the herbage  is grazed  early in the growing  season.  However, 
no bloat problem  was observed  when red clover was grazed by store 
lambs  or cattle from October  to December.  Autumn  grazing  is ideal for 
fattening  store lambs.
Thompson  (1975)  reports  that the oestrogenic  level in red clover  silaae 
is enough  to depress  the reproductive  rate of ewes. Therefore,  ewes should
10
not be fed silage prior to, and during  mating. Braden  et al. (1971)  have 
demonstrated  that cattle metabolize  plant oestrogens  more rapidly  than 
sheep  and thus may have a greater  tolerance  to oestrogenic  effects.
The silage role of the red clover crop is mainly  in arable farming  
systems  where  it makes  an ideal break  crop. Red clover  improves  the soil 
structure  and promotes  the replenishment  of soil N. Spring  barley  after  
a 3-year  tetraploid  red clover  ley yielded  5 t/ha with a N application  
of only 20 kg/ha  (Mackie,  1975).
Lucerne
Little is known  regarding  this legume  in Ireland  although  it has been 
grown  in a very small scale for drying.
This legume  is associated  with low rainfall  areas and with light dry 
soils where summer  drought  frequently  limits yield. It requires  a deep  
well drained  soil with a high pH (6.5-7.0).  Its deep rooting  system  ensures  
the production  of high yields of DM (12 -15 t/ha) in areas affected  by 
drought.  It can also be grown  on heavy soils provided  drainage  is ade­
quate  as it is very intolerant  of wet soil conditions.
A number  of highly  improved  new cultivars  which  are able to persist  
fully productive  for 4-5 years are available  and the best are : Europe,  
Sabilt,  Verneuil  and Vertus. All these cultivars  belong  to the early group  
and provide  three or four cuts per annum.
Europe  outyields  the other cultivars  by 10-15%  in the absence  of 
Verticillium  wilt. The other three cultivars  are resistant  to Verticillium  
wilt but Vertus  has the additional  advantage  of being resistant  to stem 
eelworm.
Cultivar  Europe  is being tested in a field scale experiment  at Johns ­
town Castle,  in pure and mixed swards. The total yields of dry matter  
obtained  from three harvests  in the first growing  season  were 12.8 t/ha 
in pure sward and 10.5 t/ha in mixed sward. This shows that, in con­
trast with red clover,  there is no advantage  in including  a companion  
grass with lucerne.
Lucerne  can be sown from April to the end of July but the April  
sowing  normally  gives a better establishment.  As for red clover  a good 
establishment  can be obtained  with a cereal cover  crop which  will be cut 
for silage in July.
Fertiliser  requirements  of lucerne  are 40 kg of phosphorus  and 200-300  
kg of potassium  per hectare  per annum.
The most suitable  management  for lucerne  is a first harvest  in late 
May followed  by two or three cuts with intervals  of six weeks between  
cuts.
Lucerne  silage is fairly low in digestibility  and at the time of the first 
harvest  has a 60D-value.  However,  its intake by stock is much higher  
than that of grass silages  of the same  digestibility.  A 60D level of digesti ­
bility is obtained  in the subsequent  cuts when  they are made  with 6-week 
regrowth  intervals.  Lucerne  silage has a high crude protein  content  (18- 
20%)  and is rich in minerals.
11
Lucerne  herbages  have a very low sugar content  and this made the 
production  of good  silages  difficult  before  the new improved  silage-making 
techniques  were introduced.  As for red clover the herbage  should be 
wilted for 24-48 hours and an additive  should  be used. The amount  of 
Add-F  for a crop with 20-25%  of DM should  be 3 1/t lifted material.  
There  are no bloat problems  with lucerne  silage.
Conclusions
1. The use of seeds mixtures  based on the ryegrass  cultivars  presently 
available  and specially  tailored  to produce  high yields  of good quality  
silage would reduce  significantly  the deficit  of animal  winter  fodder  
which  exists in Ireland.
2. On many farms in the arable  areas, where  soil conditions  and silage­
making  facilities  are satisfactory,  a greater  use of red clover  is recom ­
mended.
3. An attempt  should  be made  to introduce  lucerne  as a reliable  source  of 
forage in areas with light soils, where poor summer  growth  of the 
grasses  is always  a limiting  factor.

The Relative  Importance  of 
Digestibility,  Ensiling,  Fermentation  
ami Dry Matter  Content  in Limiting  
the Utilisation  of Silage by 
Beef Cattle
A. V. FLYNN  and R. K. WILSON  
The Agricultural  Institute.  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
For reasons  associated  with climate and the mechanisation  of farm  
operations,  ensiling  has become  the first choice  system  of forage  conser ­
vation on most intensive  and modernised  farms. Many problems  have 
been associated  with the ensiling  process  and with silage as a feed for 
ruminants  over the years. The purpose  of this paper is to examine  the 
major factors  which have been associated  with the restriction  of animal  
production  from ensiled  herbage  and examine  the relative  importance  of 
each of them in quantitative  terms  where  possible.  The factors  which  will 
be discussed  are digestibility,  preservation,  dry matter  content,  ensiling  
per se and fine chopping.  While  factors  like secondary  heating  during  the 
feeding  of silage (Zimmer,  1973; Wilkins,  1975) and the non-anaerobic  
storage  of silage (Ruxton  et al, 1975) can have a profound  effect  on silage 
preservation  and consequently  on the efficiency  of animal  production  from 
silage,  their effects  are well understood  and are not discussed  here.
Silage  Digestibility
While it has for long been recognised  that digestibility  of a forage  is 
a factor of major importance  determining  its intake and nutritive  value  
(McCullough,  1961; Balch  and Campling,  1962; McCarrick,  1965; Castle  
and Watson,  1969) higher  digestibility  in a silage has not always  been 
associated  with higher  production  (Tayler  and Aston,  1967) due to inter ­
action  of other factors  (Wilkins,  1974; Wilkins,  1975). Because  of these  
interactions  the relationship  between  dry matter  digestibility  (DMD)  and 
animal  production  has seldom  been described  in quantitative  terms over 
a wide range of digestibility.  In general,  a change  in silage quality  has a 
considerably  greater  effect on the productivity  of beef cattle than on the 
production  of milk in short term experiments  by dairy cows (Waldo,  
1977). Thus it is of interest  to examine  the results  of 40 feeding  experi ­
ments at this station  in which  well preserved  silages  were offered  as the 
sole feed to steers  weighing  400 kg. In most experiments,  pre-experiment  
slaughter  groups  were included  to allow  absolute  measurement  of carcase  
gain. The summary  presented  in Table 1 shows  a clear relationship  be­
tween DMD and animal  performance  in terms of daily liveweight  gain 
and daily carcase  gain. Silages  which  produced  daily liveweight  gains of

less than 0.34 kg/day  had mean DMD  = 60.4% while those which pro­

In these trials animals  were fed in groups  and mean silage  dry matter  
intakes  were recorded.  There  was a close association  between  daily dry 
matter  intake  and DMD. It ranged  from 1.6% of mean  liveweight  at 60% 
DMD  to over 1.9% at 74% DMD.  This is in contrast  with results  of work 
with sheep  (Wilkins  et al, 1971; Demarquilly,  1973) in which  the digesti ­
bility effect was masked  by variation  in preservation  but is in agreement  
with the results  of an experiment  of Wilkins  and Tetlow  quoted  by Wil­
kins (1974).
It is of interest  to note the magnitude  of the growth  rate of cattle fed 
silages  having  DMD  of 74%. Expressed  either  in terms of liveweight  or 
carcase  gain this is good production  by cattle fed only conserved  grass  
and approaches  the production  (0.57 -0.60 kg carcase/day)  expected  of 
similar  cattle  on grazed  grass  over an entire grazing  season.  The difference  
between  production  from these good silages  and the expected  production  
from grass can be explained  by difference  in feed digestibility.
Similarly  high levels of liveweight  gain on grass silage only have 
occasionally  been reported  (Stewart,  1973; Demarquilly  and Dulphy,  
1976; Mcllmoyle,  1976a'  but other reports  in terms of beef carcase  pro­
duction  are not available.
Silage  Preservation
It is generally  appreciated  that high quality  wet herbage  is difficult  to 
ensile and is predisposed  to clostridial  fermentation.  It is possible  that 
imperfect  preservation  may be responsible  for the infrequent  reports  of 
high production  from silage. Table 2 illustrates  how the quality  of the 
preservation  reduces  the production  potential  of a high quality  silage. In 
this experiment,  the well preserved  silage was treated  with 2.3 I 85% 
formic  acid per tonne  grass at time of ensiling.

value of formic  acid treatment  in ensuring  good preservation  with low 
ammonia  content  in the silage is demonstrated  and the improved  preser ­
vation  is reflected  in animal  production.

^ In vitro DMD results  for only 5 experiments
Various  reports  (Forbes  and Jackson,  1971; Mcllmoyle,  1976b;  Alder,  
McLeod  and Gibbs, 1969; Dulphy  and Demarquilly,  1977) indicate  that 
the effect of imperfect  preservation  on silage nutritive  value is reduced  
when supplementary  energy  is offered  with the silage. The effect is not 
completely  eliminated,  however.  Furthermore,  imperfect  preservation  
results  in reduced  efficiency  of conservation  of stored  dry matter  (Kauf-  
mann  and Zimmer,  1969; Waldo  et al, 1971) and in reduced  digestibility  
of dry matter  fed out of storage  (Waldo  et al, i971; Castle  and Watson,  
1970a). Thus for several  reasons,  the necessity  for perfect  preservation  
in the silo is demonstrated.
In farm practice,  silage  preservation  can be influenced  by grass species, 
content  of fermentable  carbohydrate  and by ensilage  techniques.  Jones  
(1970)  found that ryegrass  (LoUum  perenne)  was easier  to ensilage  than
17
cocksfoot  {Dactylis  glomerata)  or timothy  {Phleum  pratense).  We have 
confirmed  this in many  laboratory  experiments.
The water soluble  carbohydrate  (WSC)  content  of the grass at time 
of ensiling  is a major  determinant  of the course  of silage  fermentation  in 
the absence  of effective  additive  treatment.  While fermentable  carbohy ­
drate levels as low as 6 to 8% of the dry matter  have been suggested  as 
adequate  (Smith,  1962), it appears  from a survey  of 800 silages,  mainly 
abstracted  from published  results,  that a WSC content  equivalent  to 3% 
in the solution ensiled  is required  to give a 95% chance  of the silage  being  
well preserved  without  additive  treatments  (Wilson  and Flynn,  unpub ­
lished data). This 3% WSC solution  corresponds  to an average  14% 
WSC  in the dry matter  of samples  in this survey.
Delayed  sealing  has a detrimental  effect  on silage  preservation  (Hen ­
derson  and McDonald,  1975) and has a considerable  modifying  influence  
on the minimum  WSC  content  required  to ensure  good preservation  (Wil­
son, unpublished  results).
The absence  of a quick test which may be applied  in the field to 
reliably  estimate  the WSC content  of the herbage  being ensiled  means 
that farmers  must adopt a policy  of using formic  acid or other effective  
additive  on all high quality  herbage  ensiled  without  wilting.
Another  problem  often associated  with wet silages is low nitrogen  
retention.  While most studies  as reviewed  by Wilkins  (1974)  record  low 
nitrogen  retention  on wet silages,  it is of interest  to note that Waldo  et al 
(1969)  and Waldo  et al (1971)  and Waldo  et al (1973)  found acceptably  
good nitrogen  retention  on wet silage in which ammonia  nitrogen  was 
less than 10% of total nitrogen  in contrast  with low nitrogen  retention  
on poorly  conserved  silage  with 14% of total N as ammonia.  Low nitro ­
gen retention  may well be a specific  characteristic  of poorly preserved  
silage  rather  than a characteristic  of wet silages  in general.
Silage preservation  is commonly  accepted  as being good if less than 
14% of the nitrogen  is present  as ammonia.  It appears  from the results 
of nitrogen  retention  studies  and animal  production  studies  that a silage  
described  as being  well preserved  should  have less than 10% of its nitro ­
gen present  as ammonia.
Silage  dry matter  content
Raising  the dry matter  content  of herbage  before  ensiling  has for long 
been recognised  as a means  of ensuring  good preservation  in the silo and 
is very often regarded  as essential  in order to produce  silage with a high 
nutritive  value. Reports  of experiments  comparing  forages  of different 
dry matter  content  usually  attribute  any differences  found  to the difference  
in dry matter  content  even though  in many instances  the preservation  of 
the wetter  forage  might  have been quite imperfect  by any standard.  That  
is to say that differences  have been attributed  to dry matter  content  which  
could logically  have been attributed  to preservation.
Table 4 is a summary  of reports  comparing  forages  differing  in dry 
matter  content.

They have been arbitarily  segregated  into 2 groups depending  on 
whether  the direct  cut unwilted  silage was poorly  preserved  or well pre­
served  as indicated  by ammonia  (% total N) and/or  pH. The response  
to wilting  in terms of dry matter  intake  and animal  production  is given 
as the difference  between  unwilted  and wilted  expressed  as a percent  of 
the unwilted.  This allows  the results  of experiments  with dairy cows and 
with growing  cattle  to be summarised  in one table. As expected,  there is 
a considerable  response  to wilting  in both dry matter  intake  and animal  
production  when  wilted  silage  is compared  with poorly  preserved  unwilted  
silage. It is of considerable  interest  to note that despite  an apparent  in­
crease in dry matter  intake  due to wilting,  a production  response  is not 
normally  recorded  when wilted silage is compared  with well preserved  
unwilted  silage. Efficiency  of conversion  of forage  dry matter  to product  
appears  to be reduced  by wilting  when  wilted  silage  is compared  with well 
preserved  unwilted  silage. The mean reduction  in experiments  reviewed 
in Table  4 was 10.8%. This aspect  of forage  dry matter  content  has been  
ignored  in most reports  though  it has been noted  and discussed  by some 
(Waldo  et al, 1969; Presthegge,  1959). It indicates  that more highly  fer­
mented  and/or  wetter  silage might utilised  more efficiently  than the 
less fermented  drier forage.
There  have been several  comparisons  of unwilted  and wilted  silage  for 
beef cattle at our Institute.  The results  of 3 experiments  are summarized  
in Table  5.

In general,  dry matter  intake has been higher  for the wilted silage.  
This difference  has not, however,  been reflected  in carcase  gain. In 
another  experiment  (Flynn,  1974), wilting  increased  liveweight  gain but 
did not raise carcase  weight. The discrepancy  between  liveweight  gain 
and carcase  gain in comparisons  of forages  of different  dry matter  con­
tent has been noted before and has been shown to be attributable  to 
differences  in rumen  contents  (McCarrick,  1967). Again  there is the sug­
gestion  that the wilted  dry matter  is utilised  less efficiently  than the un­
wilted  dry matter.
• Since Ekern  and Reid (1963)  showed  more efficient  utilisation  of the 
dry matter  in a highly fermented  forage there have been basic studies 
reviewed  by Wilkins  (1974)  and Waldo  (1977)  indicating  similar  efficiency  
of utilisation  of energy  in wet and dry forages.  These  results  are in con­
flict with the apparently  better utilisation  of wet silage in feeding  trials  
but this may arise out of the fact that silage dry matter  intake is often  
a biased  estimate  of energy  intake (Waldo,  1977). It must, however,  be 
of some relevence  to note that in a comparison  of hay and silage the 
carcases  of silage  fed cattle were at least as heavy  as, and contained  more 
fat than, carcases  of hay fed cattle (McCarrick,  1967). There is a clear  
implication  in these results  that the silage  energy  is utilised  more efficiently  
than the energy  in the dry forage. This aspect  of forage  conservation  has 
to date received  too little research  attention.
The results  of a recent  experiment  (Flynn,  1976) comparing  the feed­
ing value of wilted silage (50% dry matter)  and hay for beef heifers  are 
summarised  in Table  6. Carcase  production  on the  two feeds  were similar  
but again there was a difference  in carcase  fat content  in favour  of the 
wetter,  fermented  forage. These  results  require  an explanation.

Whether  the explanation  might  be found  in the proportions  of volatile 
fatty acids (VFA ’s) in the rumen  is not clear. While  the volume  of litera ­
ture on rumen VFA ’s and their nutritional  significance  is large, very 
little of it deals specifically  with the effect of conservation  system on 
rumen  VFA pattern. What evidence  there is in this area is conflicting.  
While  some reports  indicate  lower acetic/higher  propionic  concentration  
on wetter and more highly fermented  forages  than on drier forages 
(Ekem  and Reid, 1963; Hawkins  et al, 1970; Rohr et al, 1974; Schaadt  
and Johnson,  1969; Dash et al, 1974) others have found the opposite  
(Zelter,  1969; Donaldson  and Edwards,  1976). In the experiment  referred 
to in Table 6 the rumen  VFA ’s were determined  on samples  of rumen
20
liquor  taken soon after slaughter  (Wilson  and Flynn, 1976). Acetic/pro-  
pionic  ratio was 3.5 for the wilted  silage compared  with 4.0 for the hay. 
While the difference  is small it is in the direction  which is regarded  as 
favouring  more efficient  production  by meat animals  (Ekern  and Reid,  
1963; Weiss et al, 1967) and is similar  in magnitude  to a difference  be­
tween grass and silage reported  by Donaldson  and Edwards  (1976) as 
being  large enough  to be of nutritional  significance.
Effect  of ensiling
While it is accepted  that efficient  ensiling  has little adverse  effect on 
herbage  digestibility  (Harris  and Raymond,  1963; Demarquilly,  1973) it 
is generally  accepted  that ensiling  reduces  the nutritive  value of herbage  
through  reduction  of voluntary  intake. Reduced  intake  of silage relative  
to the grass from which the silage was made has been demonstrated  
(Demarquilly  and Jarrige,  1970; Donaldson  and Edwards,  1976; Lancas ­
ter, 1975; Bryant  and Lancaster,  1970; Harris  and Raymond,  1963) but 
others working  with corn silage containing  very low levels of ammonia  
have found little difference  between  fresh and ensiled  material  (Bergen 
et al. 1974; Dinius  et al. 1968; Wilkinson  et al, 1976). Donaldson  and 
Edwards  (1976)  using sheep found that wilting  the grass and ensiling  it 
with formic  acid raised silage intake  to the level achieved  on the grass. 
Most of the experiments  quoted  here were conducted  with sheep. In 
general  the intakes  of silages  by caged sheep tend to be rather  low and 
one must question  whether  the results  of many silage experiments  con­
ducted  with sheep  are really  relevant  to cattle.
Flynn (1976) using 350 kg cattle found little reduction  in intake of 
grass silage  made with formic  acid relative  to intake  of fresh grass.
Results  of B. Michalet  (quoted  by Demarquilly  and Dulphy,  1976)  
showed  reduced  dry matter  intake  of fine chopped  herbage  by sheep  due 
to ensiling  but no reduction  in intake  by heifers. Flynn  (1977)  compared  
fresh grass and silage made with formic  acid in a 106 day experiment  
using 430 kg steers. All silages  were well preserved.  Animal  production  
results  are summarised  in Table  7.
Table 7

21
While daily liveweight  gains differed  between  the feeds dry matter  
intake  and daily carcase  gain were very similar.  Incidentally,  these results 
show once again how misleading  it can be to assess  treatment  effect on 
beef production  in terms of liveweight  change  only. The experiment  was 
conducted  to quantify  the silage intake problem  and its effect on beef 
production.  This result,  when viewed  along  with the high levels of pro­
duction  achieved  with the highly  digestible  silages  in Table 1, questions  
the existence  of the problem  for beef cattle fed on well preserved  silage.
It is becoming  apparent  that an ensiling  fermentation  in which am­
monia  production  is restricted  will not reduce  the nutritive  value of her­
bage and will not present  a feed intake  problem  of practical  importance  
for beef cattle.
Fine chopping
Several reports have appeared  recently  showing  an effect of fine 
chopping  and comminution  on intake of silage by sheep and cattle.  
Dulphy  and Demarquilly  (1973) and Demarquilly  and Dulphy  (1976)  
using sheep found a variable  intake  response  to fine chopping.  Where 
responses  were large,  the effect  of chopping  was confounded  with a silage  
preservation  effect and the increase  tended  to be due more to very low 
intake  on long silage than to elevated  intake  on the finely  chopped  silage  
(Dulphy  et al, 1975). Likewise,  Deswysen  (1978) found an Increase  in 
intake  by sheep  due to fine chopping  of silage  just before  feeding.  Demar ­
quilly  and Dulphy  (1976)  quote results  of B. Michalet  which  show a con­
siderable  response  to fine chopping  by heifers. These results  also show  
that differences  observed  with sheep  may be much  greater  than differences  
observed  with cattle on the same feeds and illustrate  again  the danger  of 
applying  the results of sheep experiments  to cattle. Demarquilly  and 
Dulphy  (1975)  showed  a response  in terms  of intake  and milk production  
by cows to fine chopping  but the efficiency  with which  feed was converted  
to milk did not seem to be improved.  Better  (1978)  increased  intake  of 
cows progressively  by chopping  to 17 mm or 9 mm compared  with 72 
mm long silage. Chopping  stemmy  forage  through  a harvesting  machine  
set to a theoretical  chop length  of 17 mm did not increase  dry matter  in­
take of steers  whereas  chopping  of 6 mm theoretical  chop length  increased  
dry matter  intake  by 15% (Flynn,  1977). Mincing  or pulping  forage  has 
been shown  to increase  intake  (Thomas  et al, 1976; Greenhalgh  and Reid,  
1975) and production  by cattle  (Houseman  et al, 1975).
It appears  that this area of silage  research  is worthy  of more investiga ­
tion but care must  be taken  to separate  the effects  of chopping  and preser ­
vation. Perhaps  we should  expect  that the effect  of fine chopping  of silage  
should  be analogous  to the effect  of processing  dry forage  as summarised  
by Beardsley  (1964).  We should  look on fine chopping  of silage  as a means  
to increase  its nutritive  value relative  to that of the parent  herbage  rather  
than as a process  necessary  to maintain  in silage the nutritive  value of 
the parent  herbage.
22
Summary
High levels  of production  by beef catle are achievable  on grass silage 
if digestibility  is high and preservation  is very good. While silage dry 
matter content can influence  preservation  and through  preservation,  
influence  intake and animal  production,  low dry matter  content  per se 
is not a major  constraint  to the productivity  of wet silage. Utilisation  of 
the dry matter  in drier and less fermented  forages  often appears  lower 
than that in wetter  and more highly  fermented  silages.  Our rather  limited  
knowledge  of the influence  of conservation  system  on rumen  fermentation  
could be a constraint  in this area. The specific  effect of ensiling  by the 
best available  techniques  on the energy  intake and nutritive  value of a 
forage needs to be firmly established.  Failure  in the past to define the 
magnitude  of silage intake problem  for cattle has possibly  been a con­
straint  to clear thinking  in the whole area of forage conservation.  We 
should  not see degree  of chopping  as a constraint  to the achievement  of 
high production  from silage but rather  as a process  to increase  the nutri ­
tive value of feed above that of the fresh parent  herbage.  In these last 
two areas there is need for more work with cattle and cows as there is a 
danger  that results  obtained  with sheep  may apply  only to sheep.

The Interaction  of Harvesting  Machinery  
and Silage  Quality
P. COMERFORD
The Agricultural Institute,  Oakpark,  Carlow.
The importance  of high quality  silage in beef or dairy production  cannot  
be over-emphasised.  This is especially  true when we consider  the high 
costs of alternative  feeds. There is an increasing  awareness  throughout  
the country  of this need but for one reason  or another  many farmers  are 
finding  it difficult  to attain their targets. There are many factors  associ ­
ated with producing  a high quality  silage  but the one which  predominates  
is the stage of cutting.  Grass which  has been fertilized  and closed  up from 
early spring  must be cut before  June 1 if the high quality  obtainable  from 
such forage  is to be preserved.  Since over 60% of all silage  made  in the 
country  is harvested  by contractors  many quality-conscious  farmers  will 
be relying  on these contractors  to complete  work on time. As more  
farmers  change  to early  cutting  it is inevitable  that a peak demand  period  
will occur in the early stages of the season. Contractors  will therefore  
not be able to cope with all the work on hands. Already  the problem  is 
acute in some areas and farmers  must wait up to three weeks  for a con­
tractor. How can this problem  be avoided  ? A number  of solutions  are 
possible.
1. By selecting  grass strains which reach maximum  digestibility  at a 
later stage than usual or strains  which retain  their peak digestibility  
for a longer  period. Such grasses  are available  and it has been shown 
that their quality  will not deteriorate  to any extent  until the latter  part 
of June. Their use should  give the farmer  more scope to obtain a 
contractor  while herbage  quality  is still high.
By adopting  a multi-cut  system  the quantities  of grass for harvesting  
in the early cut will be reduced  and the work-load  will be spread  
more evenly  over the summer  months.  This would  suit the contractors  
since mid-summer  work is usually  slack. The current  method  usually  
applied by contractors  of charging  by the acre militates  strongly  
against  the multi-cut  system  and an hourly  or all-in charge  is a more  
satisfactory  method.  In addition,  the full impact  of the multi-cut  sys­
tem can only be felt if a high proportion  of farmers  opt for the 
method.  It would  seem that this solution  will be slow in alleviating  
a problem  which  is already  acute.
3. Increase  contractor  capacity.  This is a solution  which  has only very 
limited  application  since  contractors would  be unwise  to invest  heavily  
in equipment  which  would  only be used for a short period. Should  a 
contractor  increase  his harvesting  capacity  to cater for the early rush 
he may be forced  to charge  more than normal  for this service  to com­
pensate  for the short working  season.
272.
4. The one sure way of overcoming  the early harvesting  problem  is for 
all those farmers  who cannot  get their work completed  on time by 
contract  to purchase  their own equipment.  While  this is not possible  
in every instance  there are many farmers  and groups  of farmers  who 
should  have their own equipment.  They would benefit  considerably.  
In making  the choice  as to whether  or not one should  have his own 
equipment  the following  points  should  be considered  :
(a) The ability to own and operate  machinery  : many farmers  have 
neither  the ability  nor the inclination  to own and operate  their own 
silage-making  equipment.  Such people  are best advised  to seek one 
of the other alternatives  or to offer inducements  to contractors  to 
commence  harvesting  on a pre-arranged  date.
(b) Can the silage making  routine be fitted into the existing  farming  
routine?  This question  must be carefully  considered.  If other equally  
important  work must be delayed  or omitted,  the advantages  can be 
eroded. If silage-making  coincides  with other important  work the 
speed of operation  is reduced  below acceptable  levels. It has been 
suggested  that the minimum  target should be 60 tonnes of silage  
harvested  per day. If harvesting  does not commence  until mid­
morning  and must finish early, it may be difficult  to achieve  this 
target with the machines  available.  In any event slow harvesting  
makes  it impossible  to ensile all the crop when the quality  is highest.
(c) Is ownership  of silage machinery  economically  feasible  ? In costing 
an operation  such as this it is usual to consider  what equipment  
already  exists and to assume  that it will be available  at operating  
costs plus repairs  only. Equipment  specially  purchased  for the work 
must of course  be fully costed  to the operation.  The total cost of the 
work is divided  by the acreage  harvested  and a cost j^r acre calcu ­
lated. The cost thus obtained  can be compared  with alternative  
methods  and if all things are equal the cheapest  harvesting  method  
can be employed.  For most small harvesting  systems  the break-down  
point with normal  contractor  charges  is between  50 and 120 acres.  
This does not take into consideration  the extra  cash benefits  accruing  
from a better  quality  silage as a result of early harvesting.  A recent  
study reported  in Great Britain**'  suggests  that when this is added,  
the break-even  points  can be halved.
Further  consideration  will be given to operating  costs and break-even  
points  in the following  paragraphs.
Forage  harvesting  systems  for private  ownership
There  are many  harvesting  systems  suitable  for farmer  ownership  and 
the five most popular  ones are presented  in Table 1. It shows  that the 
side mounted  single chop with a cutting  width of 50 inches  can harvest  
between  ^ and 1 acre per hour and can break-even  with a contractor  at 
50 acres harvesting  per year. At the other end of the scale the trailed  
precision  chop has a much higher  output  but would  need to harvest  over 
125 acres per year to justify  itself. If, of course,  an alternative  harvesting

harvesting  systems  using a scoring  system  of 0 - 5 for the various  head ­
ings. By combining  the information  contained  in Tables  1 and 2 it should  
be possible  to identify  the system  most suitable  for many  cases.

The pick-up  wagon
The pick-up  wagon forage harvesting  system is comparatively  new 
and merits  some additional  consideration.  The system  consists  of a pick­
up wagon,  three tractors,  a mower  and a buckrake.  Frequently  the third  
tractor  is omitted  and the same tractor  operates the mower  and buckrake.  
Most  pick-up wagons  have the ability  to take a grass  swath  off the ground
29
at a rate exceeding  two acres per hour. However,  since the wagon  must 
also transport  its load to the silo it is off the field for some of the time 
and the overall  harvesting  rate is much slower  than the picking  up rate 
(Table  1). This is one of the basic drawbacks  of the system. Farms  on 
which  the distance  between  the silo and the field exceeds  800-1000  yards  
are not suitable  to the wagon  system  unless  the machine  is large or the 
access  roads  exceedingly  good.
The power  required  by the wagon  is less than 50 hp but it is recom ­
mended  that at least a 60 hp tractor  be used with the larger  machines  to 
tow full wagons  up steep inclines  and as an insurance  against  instability  
when transporting.  Because  of their low power  requirement  wagon  sys­
tems need about  30% less fuel than a flail forage  harvesting  system  with 
the same output.  Since  crops  have to be pre-cut  for the wagon  the system  
lends itself to wilting.
Because  of the high cost of the wagon  and rotary  mower  the system  
has a high initial outlay but the running  costs are low because  of the 
small amount  of men and machines  involved.  Table 3 gives a summary  
of operating  costs for 50 to 100 hours  annual  use for a 5 and 7 year life 
span.
Table  3

80 26.50 22.60
90 23.50 20.00
100 21.20 18.10
In using  a pick-up  wagon  for the first time a number  of points  require
special  attention  to ensure that the silage isproperly  made. Since the
wagon  only chops the grass coarsely  (some machines  have extra knives  
which  can chop to a theoretical  length  of 1^") and does no laceration,  the 
forage  can be very spongy  especially  when wilted. In order that over­
heating  does not occur  the forage  should  be well rolled during  ensiling.  
When the pits are full they should be covered  immediately  with two 
layers  of 500g polythene  and the edges thoroughly  sealed.
Group  ownership
Most of the systems  already  described  are economically  justifiable  
when the acreage  harvested  is in excess  of 70 acres. There  is however  no 
reason  why two farmers  with half the acreage  should not combine  to 
purchase  and operate  the equipment  between  them and reap the same  
benefits. The concept  of partnership  or group ownershirp  is not new
30
although  very few groups  have been organised  according  to any recog ­
nized set of rules. Loose partnerships  or instances  where a machine  is 
purchased  between  groups  of farmers  and passed  from one to the other  
have a very slender  chance  of surviving  unless  the partners  have very 
clear understandings.  It has been shown both in this country  and in 
England  that where the partnership  is established  according  to well 
recognised  procedure  with clearly  defined  rules to cater for every even ­
tuality,  the arrangements  work very satisfactorily.  Some properly-run  
groups  are in existence  for many years and have continued  to expand  
their joint commitments.
Apart from the advantages  of private  ownership  already  mentioned,  
small farmers  in partnership  also have the advantage  of a pooled  labour  
force on the few occasions  of the year when thy need them. If the in­
grained  opposition  exhibited  to the concept  of group  ownership  could be 
overcome  there is no reason why this pooling  of resources  could not 
contribute  substantially  to farming  progress  in the future.  Indeed,  smaller  
farmers  may have very little alternative  in the future if they are to 
continue  to compete  successfully  with their larger  neighbours.
Wilting
Much of the grass harvested  in this country  as wilted  silage does not 
qualify  for such a description.  In most cases grass which  is cut one day 
and picked  up the following  day without  any intermediate  treatment  will 
not have wilted sufficiently  especially  if the crop is young and heavy. 
Crops cut in May are particularly  difficult  to wilt because  dews are 
usually  heavy  and drying  is slow. Wilting  in inclement  weather  requires  
a particularly  dedicated  approach.  In many  European  countries  where  a 
wilt to 40-45%  is normal  the early  cut crops  are frequently  on the ground  
for 3-4 days and receive  about 4 teddings  or other treatments.  Under  
Irish conditions  where a wilt to 25-30%  would be more common  the 
early cut crop would  have to be on the ground  for two days and receive 
two teddings.  At least one of these teddings  could be eliminated  by the 
use of a mower/conditioner.  This is a mower  with a special  attachment  
which bruises  or lacerates  the crop during  cutting  and deposits  it in a 
fluffy loose stage on the ground.  Such swaths  dry faster than untreated  
ones. Flail mowers  also can be used and subsequent  drying  is very fast 
provided  weather  conditions  are suitable.  Using a flail mower  in wet 
conditions  can result in higher  than average  dry matter  losses.
Feeding  silage
The practice  of cutting  the silage from the clamp  and trough  feeding  
it to the animals  is becoming  increasingly  popular.  A number  of systems 
are available  for removing  the silage and their selection  depends  on the 
feeding  lay-out  and the number  of animals  to be fed. Figure 1 shows 
how the common  systems  compare  on costs and output  for various  num ­
bers of animals.  While  these figures  would  indicate  that the front loader,  
especially  with an hydraulic  tipping  and grab attachment  is the most  
economical  and fastest  system  for units up to 400 animals  it is not suit-

four feeding  systems.
32
able where the silo is a distance  from the animals.  This is particularly  
true for larger  units where  the feeder  box is much  more suitable.
Although  the block  cutter system  was not covered  in the above study  
later measurements  indicate  that it has an average  feeding  rate of about  
0.5 minutes  per animal  for transport  distances  of up to 50 metres. The 
main advantage  of the block feeder  is the almost  total absence  of waste 
at the silo. In fact over a week ’s supply  of blocks  can be removed  at the 
same time without  any deterioration  of the exposed  silage surface.  Some 
buildings,  however,  do not suit block  feeders  and even in the best lay-outs  
some hand forking  is almost  Inevitable.  This however  should  not deter  
the owners  of houses  with wide centre  passages  or peripheral  feeding  from  
stacking  the blocks  just outside  the reach  of the animals  and giving  them  
their daily ration  by hand,  off the top of the blocks.
Other  systems  using more elaborate  silage cutting,  transportation  and 
feeding  arrangements  are also available.  These  have not become  popular  
mainly  because  of their price and a high degree  of specialization.

Is there a Place for Irrigation  on 
Dairy Farms?
A. J. BRERETON
Agricultural  Institute,  Johnstown  Castle,  Wexford.
The drought  years 1975 and 1976 have raised  the question  of whether  or 
not there is a place for irrigation  in Ireland.  Even without  the extreme  
drought  of those two years, given time, the question  would have arisen  
as our systems  of land-use  became  more and more intensive.
There is no doubt that in every year all parts of this country  suffer  
from drought —we have drought  in summer  whenever  we have more than 
ten consecutive  days without  rain. This paper gives our best estimates  
of the yield losses in grassland  caused  by these droughts  and indicates  
how the value of these losses  relates  to the cost of irrigation.
The response  to water was measured  at two sites in Co. Wexford — 
one site was on a coarse  sandy-textured  brown  podzol  (light Screen  soil),  
the other on a loam-textured  podzolic  gley (heavy  Rathangan  soil)—in 
1973, 1974 and 1975 (Table 1). Summer  rainfall  was 509, 465 and 295 
mm (Apr-Sep  inc) in 1973, 1974 and 1975 respectively,  so that results  
were obtained  in both wet and dry years. At each site in each year a total 
of 260 N kg/ha/annum  was used in three applications  (110, 70 and 60 
N kg/ha  in March  and after each cut. Also 40 P kg/ha  and 50 K kg/ha  
were applied  in March,  and 50 K kg/ha  after the first cut. In 1974 and 
1975 the nitrogen  rate was increased  to 400 N kg/ha  to ensure  that any 
losses by leaching  would not affect yields (this was a safety precaution  
for experimental  purposes  only). Water was applied  to the plots twice 
each week at a rate which varied with rainfall  but which ensured  that 
irrigation  and rain equalled  3.3 mm/day  since the last application.  The 
greatest  response  was obtained  in the driest  year (1975),  the least response  
in the wettest  year (1973)  (Table  2).

These results  only indicate  that grass yield in Wexford  is normally  
restricted  by water storage  and that restrictions  can be as great as 4 
tonnes/ha/annum.  In order  to obtain  a more  general  picture  for the whole  
country  over a long pieriod  of years,  predictions  of yield restrictions  using  
meteorological  records  were estimated.
The meteorological  records  for Johnstown  Castle  for years 1973, 1974 
and 1975 were used to calculate  the expected  loss of yield due to drought  
in those years,  and these calculated  values  were compared  with the losses  
found by experimentation  in those years. This comparison  was made in 
order to check that the method  of prediction  was reliable. Calculated  
annual  yield losses  are shown  in Table  3.

The predictions  were well correlated  with the measured  responses  but 
the predictions  tended  to overestimate  the response.  On the basis of this 
trend all subsequent  predictions  were corrected  accordingly.
From the meteorological  records  for selected  sites potential  annual  
yield and average  yield loss due to water shortage  were estimated  (Table  
4).
The results indicate  that the yield loss due to drought  is about 1 
tonne/ha  inland for the country  as a whole with responses  tending  to 
increase  towards  the south east. Coastal  areas generally  show a higher 
response  especially  on the south  and east coasts.
In a Dutch survey  of European  irrigation,  this country  is shown  to 
have an average  annual  maximum  water deficit  less than 25 mm in the 
west and between  25 and 50 mm in the east (Table  5).

Thus,  an average  annual  response  to water  of about 1.5 tonnes  in the 
south  east, and less than 1.0 tonnes  in the west is expected,  and in the east 
this average  is exceeded  in more  than five years  of each 10 years.
There  was no consistent  difference  in response  between  the light and 
heavy  soils. Differences  in root distribution  could  account  for this. Table  
6 shows  that if the mairt body of roots at Rathangan  were in the top 10 
cm of the profile,  then starting  at field capacity,  30.2 mm of water  would 
be available.  This is equivalent  to about 10 days ’ water loss by evapo- 
transpiration  in summer. At Screen,  the same amount  of water  would  be 
available  if the main body of roots were in the top 15 cm of the profile  
(i.e. the roots at Screen  would need to be only two inches deeper). It 
would  appear  from these data that soil type may be less important  than 
rainfall  in determining  irrigation  need for normal  soils. In shallow  soils,  
available  water  may be restricted  by soil depth.

Irrigation  systems
Agricultural  irrigation  systems  are generally  mobile  so that only part 
of the area is irrigated  on each day. Commonly,  the interval  between 
irrigation  in each part of the area is 10 days. Evaporation  in summer  is 
about 2-3 mm per day so that after a 10-day  period without  rain it is 
necessary  to apply  about  25 mm of water.  Irrigation  systems  are designed 
to deliver  this rate in a day’s working.  On heavier  soils the infiltration  
rate of water  is about  5 mm/hr;  on light soils it is about  20 mm/hr,  thus,  
even on heavy  soils it is possible  to apply  40 mm in an 8-hour  day without  
flooding.  A 10-day irrigation  cycle is used because  in this part of the 
world,  with evaporation  rates of about 2.5 mm/day,  the deficit  after 10 
days is about  25 mm (one inch). It is generally  agreed  that, with a deficit 
between  zero and 30 mm, plant growth  is little affected.  But above this 
deficit  growth  begins  to be seriously  affected.  At 120 mm growth  ceases.
The conventional  rotary sprinkler  on lateral pipes, moved by hand  
along  a fixed main supply  line, is relatively  cheap,  but has a high labour  
requirement.  It is more appropriate  for small horticultural  systems.
The modern  mobile  irrigation  systems  are designed  for larger  acreages 
with reduced  labour  inputs. They require  larger  pumps  and make  greater  
demands  on water  supply;  they also cost more. The systems  vary widely 
in design  and cost (Table  7).

The capital  cost per hectare  increases  with the size of the system 
(Fig. 1). The annual  cost/ha  for running  and maintenance  decreases  as 
the size of the system  increases  (Table  8). These  costs are based  on 1976 
data for the United  Kingdom.  We have assumed  that all costs are the 
same in Ireland  except  for the charge  for abstraction  of water from the 
mains.  In Britain  this cost is 4.2 p/4.5 m* for direct  abstraction  m summer  
and 1 p/4.5 m’ for abstraction  in winter  for reservoir  storage.  In Ireland  
the water  charge  is 25p for 4.5 ml Hence  the cost of water  is a major  item 
in the annual  Wll in Ireland.

The volumes  of water involved  in irrigation  are large. In an average  
season six million  gallons  would be required.  This is equivalent  to a 
stored  volume  of 1 ha x 2.5 m deep.
If we calculate  the value of grass dry matter  as its Barley  equivalent,  
then the grass dry matter  response  required  to justify  various  levels of 
cost may be summarised  as follows :

At these cost levels it is clear that irrigation  is only likely to be pro­
fitable  in the south  east and then only when a good private  water  supply  
is available.  In the east and south coastal  areas of high response  even the 
most costly  system  could be justified.

Calf Housing —Design  Considerations  
when Planning  Housing  for 
Home  Reared  and Bought  In Calves
C. D. MITCHELL
The Scottish  Farm  Buildings Investigation  Unit, Craibstone,  
Bucksburn,  Aberdeen.
The major  objective  in the design  and planning  of calf housing  is to pro­
vide an environment  which will encourage  the production  of healthv  
calves.  ■’
In this paper a brief outline  of calf housing  work carried  out at the 
Scottish  Farm Buildings  Investigation  Unit (SFBIU)  will be followed  by 
two commercial  examples  of calf houses  designed  on the basis of the 
results  of the experimental  studies.
General  requirements
Calf housing  should  provide  a suitable  environment  both climatic  and 
structural  for the calf and the stockman.  It should  also provide  ample  
space for husbandry  and management  tasks and should be planned  in 
detail to achieve  these objectives  at the lowest  possible  capital  and with a 
low labour  requirement.
Commencing  in 1968, at the SFBIU,  the feasibility  of naturally  venti ­
lated uninsulated  calf housing,  termed  climatic  housing,  was examined  for 
rearing  calves  from approximately  one to twelve  weeks  of age throughout  
the year. From the experiments  it was established  that climatic  housing  
With good calf husbandry  and an adequate  plane  of calf nutrition  provides  
a very acceptable  low cost alternative  to tbe previously  common  fan ven­
tilated  insulated  and often  heated  calf housing.
The main advantages  of naturally  ventilated  calf housing  are •
1. reduced  capital  cost;
2. low running  costs (no fans, heaters  or controls);
3. immunity  from failure  of electric  power;
4. correct  design a reduced  management  requirement  as no adjustments  
need be made  to the ventilation  system  throughout  the year.
Studies  were also made on the design  of natural  ventilation  systems.
hese enabled  design  data to be produced  which  will ensure  a minimum  
ventilation  rate of 20 cubic feet per minute  per calf, with a minimum  
cubic air capacity  of 200 cubic feet per calf in calf houses  with different 
cross sections  to the original  experimental  unit.
The results  provided  a design  basis for naturally  ventilated  calf hous ­
ing and buildings  were designed  and costed  against  a fan ventilated  in­
sulated  calf house. The costings  showed  that naturally  ventilated  calf 
housing  reduces  the capital  cost of calf housing  when compared  with fan 
ventilated  insulated  calf houses.
43
Overall,  naturally  ventilated  calf housing  was established  as suitable  
for calf rearing  and acceptable  both environmentally  and economically  
as an alternative  to the fan ventilated  insulated  type of calf house (Mit­
chell, 1975).
Throughout  the work the calf was considered  as the designers  client  
and an understanding  of its requirements  was put as a primary  objective. 
In the past there  had been a tendency  for package  deal manufacturers  and 
farm buildings  designers  to use a similar  structure  for poultry,  pigs and 
calves  without  first ensuring  that it was suitable  for calves. Each class of 
livestock  requires  different  environmental  conditions.
With the calf, a designer  is basically  aiming  to provide : (1) a dry bed; 
(2) a well ventilated  calf house;  (3) a draught  free environment  during  the 
winter  months.
1. A dry bed is provided  by attention  to floor  drainage  beneath  straw  
bedding  and a minimum  floor slope of 1 in 20 is required.  The bedding  
will not move down  this slope. The effects  of flooring  type on calculated  
critical  temperatures  for a 50 kg calf in calm air on full feed are given in 
Table 1.

Calf lying on wooden  slats -10
Calf lying on dry concrete + 2
Calf standing -10
* It is important  to remember  that the lower the critical temperature,  the 
better the calf is able to resist cold stress
It is often necessary  to have close site supervision  during  construction  
to ensure adequate  floor slopes and good internal  layout of drainage.  
Water bowls, automatic  feeders  or feed buckets  must be placed  at the 
lower  end of the sloped  floors  to ensure  that bedding  remains  dry.
2. Well ventilated  calf house. In a naturally  ventilated  calf house 
the minimum  ventilation  rate is calculated  on the basis of the stack effect  
and the maximum  rate on the wind effect. Ventilation  should  be designed 
to provide  specific  rates. It is a precise  science  and not ‘a hole, a hole 
and a hope that it will work ’. Design  data given at the end of this paper  
will ensure  an adequate  minimum  ventilation  rate per calf. Ventilation  
should  be designed  to remove  moisture  vapour  produced,  disease  organ ­
isms,  dust and foul air, and replace  them with fresh air. Ventilation  should  
also remove  by-products  such as ammonia,  hydrogen  sulphide,  carbon  
dioxide  and methane.
44
3. A draught  free environment  during  the winter  months. Draught  
free conditions  at calf level are achieved  by attention  to internal  details  
and studies  of internal  airflow  patterns. At the SFBIU  we are fortunate  
in having  both a water  table and a wind tunnel  for ventilation  studies.
Model  study  airflow  in two calf houses  (Mitchell  and Ross 1977)
Model studies  were carried  out to examine  the effect of pen covers 
together  with solid and open pen fronts on the air flow patterns  in two 
naturally  ventilated  calf houses. One calf house was a model of the 
SFBIU  experimental  climatic  calf house with two rows of pens and a 
central  passage.  Pen covers  were first used over the rear of the pens in 
1968 and continued  in use throughout  the work. The other  had four rows 
with two passages  and was a typical  four-row  naturally  ventilated  calf 
house. In both buildings  air inlets were below  eaves level and air outlets  
were open ridges.
The flow patterns  were based on flow in the plane of a cross section 
from right to left. This flow represented  the wind effect component  of 
natural  ventilation.  The stack effect was ignored  together  with the effect  
of heat output  from the calves.
Perspex  models  to a scale of 1:20 were used in the SFBIU  watertable  
using  an ink tracer  and the general  flow patterns  were traced. There  was 
a slight problem  of stability  with the flow patterns  which  meant  that the 
repeatability  of the patterns  had to be checked  to ensure  that the dom ­
inant pattern  was recorded.
For both buildings  the various  combinations  of pen covers  and pen 
type were examined.  From the range of combinations  used, a selection  
has been made  to illustrate  the main points  arising.
(1) Pen covers. Model  tests were carried  out for both the two-row  
and four-row  calf house  designs  with and without  pen covers  over the rear 
of the calf pens. Omitting  the pen cover  results  in a downcurrent  on the 
opposite  wall to the main air inlet and part of the primary  air flow occurs 
at calf level (Fig. 1).
The presence  of pen covers  raises the lower limit of the primary  air 
flow thereby  effectively  reducing  the air speed at calf level. Secondary,  
slower  flow occurs  beneath  the cover at calf level. In the full-scale  calf 
house this secondary  flow together  with convection  above the calves  en­
sures adequate  ventilation  at calf level.
The pen cover  has a similar  effect  when the air inlets are representing  
space boarding  or when they represent  openings  between  the pen cover 
and the eaves. The latter situation  might be used under summer  condi ­
tions if the ventilation  panels  can hinge  downwards.
(2) Solid versus  open pen fronts. Solid pen fronts also reduce  air 
speeds at calf level but do not prevent  down currents  along the walls 
(Fig. 2).
(3) Solid fronts with pen covers. In model tests where both pen 
covers  and solid fronts  are used the pen cover  tends  to have the dominant  
effect as far as raising  the primary  flow and thereby  reducing  air speed 
at calf level is concerned  (Fig. 3).
45
Fig. 1—Effect  of pen covers  on airflow
The main effect of the cover is to prevent  downcurrents  of air along 
the sides of a calf house. It is primarily  a flow director  and reduces  air 
speeds  at calf level.
There  is no need to insulate  pen covers. Erroneous  statements  regard ­
ing covers  have implied  heat conservation  but the main aim of a cover  
is airflow  direction.  There is also no need to cover any more than the 
rear 800 mm of a pen.
Temperature  patterns  recorded  from thermocouples  in the SFBIU  
climatic  calf house show that temperature  lift beneath  a cover is only 
slight  in a well ventilated  calf house  (Table  2).
In the SFBIU  climatic  calf house, air speeds at calf level did not 
exceed  0.25 m/sec  (50 ft/min)  below  the f)en covers  but speeds  up to 1.25 
m/sec  (200 ft/min)  were recorded  above  the pen covers.

Discussion
Both pen covers  and solid pen fronts have an effect on the flow pat­
tern in calf houses  and therefore  an effect on the air speed at calf level.  
The pen cover  has a more marked  effect than solid pen fronts. It is also 
interesting  to note the low air speeds recorded  at calf level during  the 
winter  months  in the SFBIU  climatic  calf house  with pen covers,  and with 
railed  rather  than solid pen fronts.
A completely  solid pen front would have a serious  disadvantage  in 
practice  as feed buckets  would have to be inside  the pen where  they can 
easily be fouled. However  partly solid pen fronts which allowed  calves  
access  to buckets  outside  the pen are possible.
If solid fien fronts  and solid pen divisions  were used, calves  would  not 
w able to see each other which is undesirable.  In certain  cases it might  
be useful to incorporate  an occasional  solid pen division,  e.g. to prevent  
cold draughts  in winter  along  the length  of a calf house. The freedom  of 
choice  regarding  solid and open pen fronts  and divisions  should  be left to 
the discretion  of the designer  concerned.  Simple  model  studies  could be 
used to indicate  the effect  of different  internal  designs.
Let us now consider  two examples  of commercial  naturally  ventilated  
calf houses. Both were designed  some years ago following  interest  by 
farmers  and are typical  of designs  produced  over the years.
Example  A. A large scale naturally  ventilated  calf house  for a farmer  
batch rearing  bought-in  calves.
Having  had experience  of rearing  calves in controlled  environment  
housing  for many years, Mr. J. McFarlane  decided  to choose  climatic  
housing  for the calf unit at Earnslaw,  Leitholm,  Berwickshire.  It has 
advantages  for calf health and management  and is less costly than con­
48
trolled  environment  housing.  The unit is in three sections : nursery,  inter ­
mediate  and follow-on.  The buildings  are straightforward  but great  
attention  has been paid to detail.
Nursery  Building
The nursery  is a long narrow  building  (Fig. 4) measuring  37.000  x 
4.870 X 2.450 m to the eaves (121 x 16 x 8 ft) with traditional  0.610 m 
(2 ft) stone  walls. It is divided  into three sections  by existing  stone walls, 
and it accommodates  84 calves  in three lots of 28 each. It used to be a 
cattle shelter  attached  to open yards. It was gutted,  the openings  were 
built up in salvaged  stone to match the existing  walls and the old low 
dilapidated  slated roof was removed  together  with its timbers,  and re­
placed  by a new roof of coloured  asbestos  on timber  trusses  and purlins.  
Replacing  the entire  roof like this allowed  the eaves height  to be raised  
to 2.450 m (8 ft) and this in turn allowed  1.000 m (3 ft 3 in) deep slatted  
boarding  to be fitted all round. This, together  with the ‘shelf formed  by 
the top of the 0.610  m (2 ft) stone  walls,  ensures  draught-free  inlet ventila ­
tion, and a 0.150  m (6 in) wide continuous  open ridge with upstands  takes  
care of the outlet ventilation.  This ridge is fitted with protective  wire 
mesh to keep out birds.
The individual  pens are 1.520 x 0.910 m (5 x 3 ft) and the divisions  
are of the open sparred  BCX^M  type (Fig. 4). There is a solid back to 
keep the calf off the wall and to prevent  the wall being soiled. The pen 
floors  have a relatively  steep slope of 0.100  in 1.520  m (4 ins in 5 ft) from  
back to front. This ensures  good drainage  and a dry bed. The pens are 
bedded  generously  with straw  twice a day. This makes  for a comfortable  
lie, and also allows  the calves  to eat a certain  amount  of straw. They are 
fed once a day, in the morning.
The nursery  building  is based on the results  of the experimental  work  
on climatic  calf housing  carried  out at the Scottish  Farm Buildings  In­
vestigation  Unit. The building  is naturally  ventilated,  the roof is unin ­
sulated  and no heat is supplied.  The idea is that if the calf has ample  
fresh air, free from draughts,  and has a dry bed, it can stand normal  
winter  temperatures  without  ill effect,  and will in fact be a healthier  and 
hardier  calf. This has been proved  in the unit at Earnslaw.  The mortality  
rate over a period  of seven  years with 4,200  calves  is below  1 %.
Pellets  are on offer after the first few days and the calves  stay in the 
nursery  section  until they are eating  2 lb per head per day (usually  at age 
four or five weeks). Then they move as a batch into four pens to the 
intermediate  building.
Intermediate  building
This is 41.150  x 12.230  x 2.720 m to eaves (135 x 40 x 9 ft) and is a 
new building  (Fig. 4) erected  alongside  the nursery  building  but spaced  
some 7.000 m (23 ft) away. It is of steel frame  construction  with 0.230  m 
(9 in) hollow  block walls and slatted  boarding  all round,  including  the 
gables. The roof is of asbestos  and there is a 0.230 (9 in) continuous  
open ridge with upstands,  again protected  with wire mesh against  birds.

The calves  stay in the intermediate  house  until they are 12 weeks  old, 
and then they move on to the follow-on  section,  which consists  of tradi ­
tional semi-open  straw bedded  courts.
Health. Health  and hygiene  are considered  to be all-important.  The 
walls are sprayed  every fortnight  against  insects. The pen divisions  are 
removed  after every batch and cleaned,  and they are re-creosoted  after  
second  batch. The house is rested for three weeks between  each batch  
and is rested  completely  from August  to October.
A very important  role is played  by the veterinary  surgeon  who sees 
every calf the day after arrival  and there-after  inspects  them once a week.
Labour. The calf unit is run by one man.
Costs. The unit was erected  in 1971 for a gross cost of £11,000,  in­
cluding  demolition  of old buildings,  making  up of site, hardcore  road ­
ways,  and all fixtures  and fittings.
Example  B. A naturally  ventilated  calf house with monopitch  roof 
for a farmer  rearing  home  reared  calves.
Accommodation  was required  by Thornton  Farms  Limited,  Mains  of 
Thornton,  Laurencekirk,  Kincardineshire  for calves  from the dairy herd 
up to four or six months  of age. Cows  were calved  from October  through  
to June mainly  in existing  boxes and at three days the calves would  be 
moved  to the calf house. After discussions  between  the estate  factor,  farm  
manager,  farm building  and veterinary  specialists  and advisers,  the design  
was developed  from the requirements  which  were formulated  at this early  
stage. Visits were made to a number  of calf houses  on other farms,  and 
full account  was taken  of current  research  and development  work on calf 
housing  in the UK.
Basic  requirements
It was decided  that the design  must meet the following  requirements :
1. Accommodation  for 108 calves with ages ranging  from three days 
to six months  at any one time.
2. Individual  penning  for the first two weeks.
3. Potential  for isolation  of groups  or individuals  within  the building.
4. Good  ventilation.
5. A dry bed for all calves.
6. Good  day lighting  and maximum  penetration  of sunlight.
7. Unobstructed  observation  of all calves.
8. Good access  for under-cover  feeding  and general  management.
9. Easily  cleaned  internal  surfaces  at calf level.
10. Easy removal  of muck  by mechanical  means.
11. Three  additional  loose boxes.
12. A feed storage  and preparation  area.
The building
A site was chosen  for a new calf house separate  from existing  tradi ­
tional buildings  and from both foot and wheeled  traffic  associated  with 
older  cattle. It could thus be managed  in isolation  if required.  The loca­
51
tion was in close proximity  to the manager ’s house to encourage  both 
routine  and casual  visits for observation,  and it was convenient  for veter ­
inary  visits and treatment  without  passage  through  other buildings.
It was decided  to use a tethered  feed fence to provide  individual  
accommodation  for calves  during  the first two weeks  in this building.  The 
tethered  feed fence was fitted with milk containers  and rubber teats 
instead  of buckets  in order  to ensure  that the calves  received  milk through  
a teat before moving  to group pens and automatic  feeders. Access  to 
calves  for insjjection  and attention  is much  easier  in a tethered  feed fence  
than in individual  pens and the veterinary  practitioner  supported  this 
view. Details  of the tethered  feed fence were published  (Mitchell,  1972)  
and are also available  as a detailed  drawing.  Calves  would  then be trans ­
ferred  to group  pens and fed by an automatic  machine  until weaning.
The building  (Fig. 5) has a linear  plan. The feed pass, which  is 1.400  
m wide, gives covered  access  to all sections  and to the feed store and pre­
paration  area. A monopitch  roof with the building  facing south-west  
allows  maximum  penetration  of sunlight,  and rooflights  give good day­
lighting  to all parts of the building.  Natural  ventilation  is provided  by an 
opening  beneath  the eaves along the length  of the passage  at the back,  
space boarded  to prevent  strong through-draughts,  and an open front  
which  acts as both an air inlet and outlet. The sheeted  front gates give 
good shelter  to lying animals  in the open-fronted  sections.  Again  model  
studies  were used to ensure  a draught  free internal  environment.
Each section  is divided  off by a partition  of cement  rendered  block- 
work  to a height  of 1.5 m and flat asbestos  on timber framing  above. This 
prevents  facial contact  between  calves in different  sections.  Initially  it 
was planned  to have doors in the passage  between  the separate  sections

to prevent  through-draughts.  Then it was felt that they would hinder  
movement  between  sections  so it was decided  to leave them out unless 
they proved  necessary.
A dry bed was known  to be very important  in all types  of calf housing. 
This is provided  by straw bedding  on 100 mm thick concrete  floors,  with 
a damp  proof  membrane,  laid to falls of approximately  1:20 away from  
the centre  of the pens. This ensures  that any free liquid —urine or spillage 
from drinkers  and feeders —drains  quickly  out of the pens. Straw  usage 
is then minimised  with maximum  calf comfort. The loose boxes are 
drained  separately  from the rest of the building.  The roof is corrugated  
asbestos  cement  sheeting  on steel Z-purlins  supported  by a steel frame. 
No roof insulation  is necessary  in this type of freely ventilated  building  
for calves. There is 3.4 m clear headroom  at the front for mucking  out 
by tractor.
Operation
(1) Calf health and performance.  Approximately  324 calves have 
been reared in this building  from three days of age to five months  at the 
time of writing. Calf health and performance  have been very good. 
Young  calves settled in quickly  and suffered  no appreciable  check on 
sei>aration  from their dams. There has been a complete  absence  of 
respiratory  stress  even at very low temperatures  with high external  winds. 
Observations  by the veterinary  adviser  by day and night showed  rectal  
temperatures,  posture  and behaviour  to be normal  under all conditions.  
General  health and growth  rates have been good and veterinary  costs 
minimal.  Only four calves  have died to date.
Relative  to external  conditions  the building  gives protection  from  
direct precipitation,  provides  a dry bed, and reduces  air velocity  at calf 
level. An open-fronted  monopitch  design  is very unusual  in the north ­
east of Scotland  and it is interesting  to observe  its success  under  severe  
weather  conditions.
(2) Access. The clear passage  width of 1.400 m has been appreci ­
ated by the stockmen  for ease of movement  and feeding. Opening  and 
closing  of doors in the passage  between  sections  would have been a 
nuisance.  Experience  to date and subsequent  model  studies  in the SFBIU  
water table have shown that draughts  were unlikely  to be created  by 
omitting  the doors. Tractor  access  for muck removal  is excellent.
(3) Partitions.  Soft asbestos  panels  were used above  the 1.5 m high 
cement  plastered  blockwork  partitions  between  sections  because  they were  
cheaper  than infilling  completely  with blockwork.  It has been found  that 
calves  are able to reach up and damage  the panels. An extra two courses  
of blocks,  giving  a blockwork  height  of 1.9 m would  have prevented  this.
(4) Flexibility.  The building  is extremely  flexible  in use and spare  
sections  have been used for a variety  of purposes  including  holding  adult  
cows, barley  beef animals  during  the summer  months,  and even machin ­
ery storage. All internal  partitions  are non-load-bearing  and could be 
removed  at a future  date should  a complete  change  of use be required.
53
In both examples  given it is not necessary  to adjust  the building  for 
surnmer  or winter  ventilation.  Space boarding  being fixed is better  than 
a hinged  inlet baffle which may require  adjustment.  In order to reduce  
labour  requirement  demountable  pens are used and tractor  access  is pro­
vided to allow  muck  removal  by tractor  and foreloader.
Basic  layout  and design  check  list
Basic data for calves  up to 12 weeks  of age are given below  together  
with a design  check  list.

Water. Individually  penned —one water  bucket  for each {ten.
Group  penned —one water  bowl for every 10-12 calves.
Trough  frontage.  Feeding  space  for individually  fed calves —350 mm 
(1 ft 2 in) per calf.
Floor  design. Beneath  straw bedding  provide  concrete  floors with a 
slope of at least 1 in 20. Passages  should  be domed  and the floor slope  
in feed storage  areas should  be 1 in 40.
Environmental  requirements
1. Cubic  air capacity  when fully stocked  6 m’/calf (212 ftVcalf).
2. Ventilation.  With eaves  level air inlets  and ridge  outlets  allow  an inlet 
area of 0.045 mV  calf (0.5 fp/calf),  an outlet  area of 0.04 mV  calf (0.4 
ftVcalf)  and 1.5 -2.5 m (5-8 ft) height  difference  between  the two. 
If pens are arranged  along  the sides of a naturally  ventilated  building,  
then a cover  should  be placed  over the rear part of the pen to prevent  
incoming  air from dropping  onto the calves. If fans have to be used 
design  on a basis of 35-105  m’/h (20 - 62 ft^/min)  {>er calf.
Air movement  rate close to the calf, not more than 0.25 m/s (50 ft/

Ensure  that the following  points  have been clarified  in the final design 
by checking  with the design  data above  or by referring  to Mitchell,  1976.  
The most common  faults  occur  in these aspects.
Drainage.  Are floor slopes  adequate  in pens, passages,  feed storage  
and preparation  area? Are liquids  led out of the building  without  fouling  
working  areas,  without  passing  through  calf pens?
Natural  ventilation.  Is the total air inlet area adequate?  Is the total 
air outlet  area adequate?  Are the inlets  well distributed?  Will the calves 
be free from draughts?
Mechanical  ventilation.  Use manual  NOT thermostatic  fan controls.  
Is fan capacity  adequate  at the working  back pressure?  Is the air inlet 
area adequate?  Are the inlets well distributed?  Will the controls  ensure  
that the ventilation  rate will not go below  the minimum  required?  Will 
the calves  be free from draughts?
Materials  handling.  Is the size of the feed storage  and preparation  
area adequate?  Is it positioned  well in relation  to the calf pens? Can 
bedding  and muck be easily  brought  in and removed  from the building?

Summary
In the design  of calf housing  it is essential  to formulate  a detailed  out­
line of the housing  requirements  at the outset  whether  planning  housing  
for home reared or bought-in  calves. By consideration  of the design 
requirement  and eurrently  available  design  data it is possible  to produce  
low cost naturally  ventilated  calf houses  which  will ensure  successful  calf 
rearing  provided  management  and nutrition  are also adequate.

The Influence  of Management  and 
Feeding  Practices  on Calf Performance
R. J. FALLON
Agricultural Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Introduction
A calf rearing  programme  must contain  a management  and feeding  sys­
tem which  minimises  incidence  of disease  and the risk of calf deaths,  and 
simultaneously  provide  satisfactory  calf liveweight  gain. In this paper,  
a number of  factors  which  influence  calf performance  while  it is dependent  
on a liquid  diet are discussed.
Colostrum
A survey  of 1,250 calves purchased  direct from farms or from calf 
auction  marts for Grange  over the last four years showed  that 40% had 
inadequate  blood serum antibody  levels when purchased.  It was shown 
that low antibody  levels  were associated  with increased  rates of mortality  
(Table 1). Blood serum immunoglobulin  (Ig) level of 15-20  ZST units  
provides  moderate  protection.  However,  levels  in excess  of 20 ZST units  
are more desirable.

level on calf mortality

The low immunoglobulin  levels  obtained  could be due to : —
Weak  calf unable  to suckle  sufficiently  soon after birth.
Calf unable  to suckle  from a cow which  has a pendulous  udder.
Cow may not permit  calf to suckle.
Farmer  may not allow calf to suckle dam and may neglect  to feed 
sufficient  colostrum  to the calf in the first 6 - 12 hrs of life.
Cow may be milked  immediately  after calving  or have leaked  milk 
before  calving  so that the colostrum  available  to the calf is low in 
immunoglobulins.
The calf ’s ability  to injest  sufficient  immunoglobulin  is dependent  on •
(a) the amount  fed— minimum  of 4 kg for a 40 kg calf within 12 hrs of birth;
57
(b) the concentration  of immunoglobulin  in the colostrum  fed—the mean  
immunoglobulin  values  for first, second  and third milkings  after calv­
ing are 11.5, 6.0 and 2.5 gms/ 100 ml respectively;
(c) time of feeding —the calf’s ability  to absorb  the immunoglobulin  frac­
tion of colostrum  has decreased  by half between  birth and 16 hrs and 
has practically  stopped  at 24 hrs after birth.
Ideally,  the calf should  be afforded  the opportunity  to injest its first 
feed of colostrum  from its dam within  6 hrs of birth. This means  that 
the calf should  be assisted  in suckling.  However,  it may be necessary  to 
augment  this suckling  with artificial  feeding  of the colostrum  in parti ­
cular cases.
The alternative  is to artificially  feed the calf first milking  colostrum  
in two feeds, the first feed 4 - 6 hrs after birth and the second  4 - 6 hrs 
later. The calf should  be fed to appetite  with colostrum  that has been 
reheated  to blood temperature.  The calf’s intake from two feeds is 
approximately  10% of calf body weight  and this should  provide  most  
calves  with adequate  antibody  protection  (Table  2).

Calf type
Studies  over a three year period  at Grange  have shown  a positive  rela­
tionship  between  weight of calf at purchase  and subsequent  survival 
(Table  3). These  results  indicate  that in order to minimise  loses, particu ­
larly when large numbers  are being  purchased,  the stronger/heavier  type 
of calf must be bought.  This type is also likely  to be older.
When the price paid for calves  at auction  markets  is examined,  it is 
found  that the price paid is related  to size of calf (Table  4).

The purchaser  at the auction  mart pays a higher  price for the older  
heavier  calf. Therefore  it will be in the producer ’s interest  to keep the 
calf on the home farm for the first 2 to 3 weeks  so that it will be at least 
45 kg at time of sale. Such a calf should  present  minimum  rearing  prob ­
lems for the purchaser.  A three week old calf should  logically  cost £ 10- 
El 5 more than a calf less than one week old due to : 
a) Saving  to purchaser  of three week old calf :
b)i) lower level of mortality  (2% instead  of 8%) £3.50

Production  targets
The targets  for calf growth  in artificial  rearing  are given in Table 5. 
These targets  are readily  attainable  and when they are not achieved  the 
calf rearing  system  should  be analysed  with particular  reference  to feed 
inputs  and incidence  of disease. The calf, in order to attain  these target  
weight  gains (Table  5), will require  20 - 25 kg of milk replacer  and 80 - 100 
kg of calf concentrates.

Calf feeding  schedule
The feeding  schedule  in Table  6 will provide  the necessary  feed inputs  
to attain  the above  target  weights.

These feed inputs may be increased  to provide  greater  initial live- 
weight  gains. Table 7 shows the liveweight  gains which were obtained  
when  25, 37 and 50 kg of milk replacer  were fed over a 7 - 56 day period  
at Grange.  However,  the medium  and high planes  of nutrition  in Table  7 
have a number  of disadvantages :
a) greater  incidence  of scour  and risk of higher  mortality;  
higher  inputs  of milk replacer;  
lower  intakes  of concentrates;
greater  risk of over-feeding,  namely  a severe  digestive  upset  occurring  
when calf is placed  on the high feeding  initially.

Effect  of management  practices  on calf performance  
on automatic  feeders
Recent  research  on automatic  calf feeders  at Grange  shows  that dif­
ferent  methods  of introducing  calves  to the automatic  feeder  did not affect  
subsequent  calf performance  (Table  9).

4)Directly  on to automatic  feeder

Preparing  the calf for the automatic  feeder  by pail or nipple  feeding  
for seven days prior to introduction  on to feeder  did not improve  calf 
performance  and would  not be advocated  as a routine  practice.
A second  experiment  showed  that by increasing  the concentration  of 
milk replacer  fed from the feeder,  when  the calves  were first introduced  to 
the feeder,  resulted  in seven  deaths  out of 40 calves  (Table  10).
When  the calves  were fed from an automatic  feeder  which  dispersed  
a 20% solution  of milk replacer  (1 kg in 5 litres of water),  the treatment  
had to be discontinued  after three days because  of illness  and deaths. It 
was concluded  that the initial  concentration  of 20% is unsuitable  where 
bought-in  calves  were first introduced  to the automatic  feeder. It is there ­
fore not recommended.

Another  experiment  at Grange  examined  the effect of weaning  calves 
abruptly  off an automatic  feeder  when they had consumed  either 30 kg 
or 50 kg milk replacer.  Weaning  off the feeder  when  the calves  consumed  
30 kg of milk replacer  resulted  in a severe check in growth  rate after 
weaning  (Table  11), due to low concentrate  consumption  before  weaning. 
The average  daily concentrate  consumption  for the seven days before 
weaning  was only 0.1 kg per day for the calves  weaned  when fed 30 kg 
of milk replacer  compared  to 0.4 kg per day for the calves  weaned  when 
fed 50 kg of milk replacer.

Automatic  calf feeders  reduce  the labour  inputs  required  in calf rear­
ing and allow for redeployment  of farm labour. However,  the use of 
automatic  calf feeders  requires  vigilant  stockmanship  by the operator.
Automatic  feeder —critical  management  aspects
* Daily  intake  of milk replacer  by the calf is not controlled.
* Bought-in  calves are liable to overfeed  when first introduced  to the 
feeder.
* Avoid  mixing  very young  calves  with 4 - 5 week old calves,  particu ­
larly on dairy farms.
* Calf fed on automatic  feeder  requires  40 - 50 kg of milk replacer.
62
* Calves  on automatic  feeders  have a loose faeces  due to high input of 
milk replacer.
* There  is difficulty  in getting  some calves  which  are on ad libitum  milk 
to eat sufficient  concentrates  before  weaning.
Cost of calf rearing —7-84 days
Costs are summarised  as follows :
System 1 : Pail feeding  7-75 days— input of 25 kg of milk replacer  and 
95 kg of calf concentrate.  Liveweight  gain 0.60 kg/day.
System  2: Automatic  feeding  7 - 63 days —input of 50 kg of milk re­
placer  and 53 kg of calf concentrate.  Liveweight  gain 0.65 
kg/day.

Factors  Affectinjj;  Milk Yield per Cow
P. A. GLEESON
Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
Milk yield per cow is of critical  importance  in defining  farm income  on a 
well stocked  dairy farm. Optimum  dairy farm management  however  re­
quires both high stocking  rate and high milk yield per cow. These  dual 
objectives  can be obtained  at the same time and they are not antagonistic  
to each other. It is easier  to increase  stocking  rate on dairy farms  than to 
increase  milk yield per cow. The discussion  on increasing  milk yield per 
cow in Ireland  has been mainly  in terms of animal  breeding  and feeding.  
While these factors  are important,  they are only two of the many herd 
management  details  which  determine  milk yield per cow within  herds.
The factors affecting  cow milk yield are best presented  within the 
three categories  shown  in Table 1. The first factor,  potential  of the cow, 
is mainly  influenced  by breeding,  size and age at first calving.  Effects  of 
breeding  both from the male and female  side will not be discussed  in this 
paper.  Size and age at first calving  are important  determinants  in influenc ­
ing both first lactation  yields and possibly  have major  influences  on the 
life time performance  of the animal.
The management  of the dairy  cow during  the lactation and  dry periods  
will be discussed  under  the influence  of feeding,  time of calving  and lac­
tation  number.  However,  two other  factors  are important,  namely,  disease  
control  during  the season  and good milking  management.
The rate of culling  and degree  of mortality  in herds  have a big impact  
on output  from dairy herds. Culling  is influenced  by the number  of herd 
replacements  available  in the herd, the disease  state of the herd and the 
fertility  of the herd. These  three factors  determine  the rate at which  cull­
ing takes place in the herd in any one year.

Trends  in milk yields  and stocking  rate on Irish dairy  farms
In recent times it appeared  that milk yield per cow was increasing. 
However  the more recent statistics  indicate  that the national  yield per 
cow is still less than 600 gallons. This has been confirmed  in a recent  
survey  (Table  2) on a national  basis. The average  yield per cow was 579 
gallons.  There  was however,  a higher  milk yield in the Munster  area, the 
traditional  dairying  area of the country,  but even in that province  average 
milk yield per cow was only 623 gallons.  A further  disconcerting  feature  
emerging  from this survey  is the low average  stocking  rate of approxi-  
mately  two forage  acres per livestock  unit. It is against  this background  
that I propose  to deal with some aspects  which influence  milk yield per 
cow.

Weight  at first calving
There is little information  available  on the optimum  weight  to calve 
down two year old heifers  and its effect on subsequent  lactations.  An 
experiment  is presently  in progress  at the Agricultural  Institute  Field  
Station,  Ballyragget,  Co. Kilkenny,  where two year old Friesian  spring  
calving  heifers  were divided  into four treatment  groups  to compare  the 
effect of weight  at first calving  on lactation  performance.  Two groups  had 
a target weight  of 1,000 lbs weight  before calving  and were stocked  at 
0.95 and 0.75 acres/animal  after calving. The other two groups  had a 
target weight of 1,150 lbs before calving and were also stocked at 
0.95 and 0.75 acres per cow after calving.  These stocking  rates provide 
grazing  and silage requirements.  The heifers were fed grass silage  
ad libitum  and 12 lbs concentrates/head/day  after calving  until trans ­
ferred to grass in mid-March.  The groups  are rotationallly  grazed  on 
pasture  and 75% of each farmlet  is conserved  for winter  feed.
The average  performance  in the first two lactations  is presented  in 
Table  3.
Since this is a long term study caution  must be observed  in drawing  
conclusions  at this stage. The heavier  animals  in the first lactation  had an 
increased  milk production  of approximately  100 gallons  per heifer. The 
first lactations  in 1976 coincided  with a very dry summer.  This resulted  
in the animals  being in poor body weight  at the end of the first lactation.  
The pre-calving  weights  of all groups  in 1977, start off the second  lacta ­
tion, were only at the same level as at the beginning  of the first lactation.

This had a large influence  on milk yields in the second  lactation  and, in 
some treatments,  it depressed  lactation  yields in the second  year from 
those obtained  in the first lactations.  Those  treatment  groups  with poor  
lactations  in 1977 tended  to compensate  in body weight  and resulted  in 
very good body weight  conditions  at the end of the 1977 lactation  year. 
This increase  in bodyweight  could  have a major  influence  in the lactations  
(third)  at the beginning  of 1978. The only conclusions  one can draw from  
this experiment  at this early stage are: (1) the heavier  the heifer  at first 
calving,  the higher  the milk yield; (2) if animals  are not given an oppor ­
tunity to increase  body condition  between  the first and second  calvings 
milk yield can be depressed  in the second  lactation  and (3) animals  tend 
to gain extra weight  during  the second  lactation  at the expense  of milk 
production.

Pre-calving  feeding
Body  reserves  built up during  the dry period  can be utilised  to support  
milk production  in early lactation.  During  the last eight  weeks  Preceedmg 
parturition,  a liveweight  gain of 1.5 lbs per day is desirable  An outl ne 
of how these levels  of gam can be attained  with various  levels  of feeds  
illustrated  in Table 5. These figures  are only a guideline  and show how 
the type and quantity  of roughage  fed, influence  the level of concentra  
feeding  required  with poor quality  feeds. These  figures  are based  on cows  
weighing  10 cwts and a silage  with a dry matter  of 20

The figures  show that increasing  the concentrate  level results  in a de­
pression  of silage intake by the dairy cow. This table also shows the 
degree  to which  body condition  or bodyweight  loss can influence  the milk 
pr^uction  obtained  per cow at various  feeding  levels Thus,  as concen ­
trate feeding  levels increase,  there is a reduction  in silage intake an in­
crease  in milk production  and a decrease  in bodyweight  loss by the cow.
68
Silage  quality  and milk yield
Silage  quality  is influenced  by the quality  of the material  ensiled,  and 
the efficiency  of preservation.  Voluntary  intakes  of silage  conserved  “Om 
poor quality  material  or which are poorly  preserved  are very low and 
large inputs  of concentrates  are required  to supplement  low intakes.  Table  
7 illustrates  the level of concentrates  required  for varying  milk production  
levels depending  on silage quality.  The additional  concentrates  required  
with poor quality  silage  in order  to achieve  the same level of milk  produc ­
tion as with good silage is about 8 lb per cow per day. Over a winter  
period  this can amount  to £33 per cow.

A guideline  to the possible  levels  of concentrates  to be fed after calv­
ing to spring  calving  cows in 1978 is shown  in Table  8. The figures  show  
that as the level of feeding  increases  the response  to extra coricentrates  
decreases  when measured  over the full lactation.  With a possible  price 
of 50p per gallon  for milk in 1978 and the concentrates  costing  £120 per 
ton, the economic  level of concentrate  feeding  with good silage should  
be between  15 - 16 lb per cow per day.

Effect  of wilting  on silage  quality
Table 9 shows that wilting  resulted  in increased  silage dry matter  
intakes  and reduced  body weight  losses. However,  there was very little 
effect on milk yield per cow in this experiment.

Concentrate  feeding  on grass
There  is very little limited  information  in the influence  of concentrate  
feeding  on pasture  in early spring. This type of experimentation  is diffi­
cult because  the conditions  vary as grass growth  improves  with the ad­
vancing  season and the need for supplementation  generally  decreases.  
The Moorepark  recommendations  have been to feed the same quantity  of 
concentrates  for the first two weeks  after turnout  as were fed during  the 
indoor  period. The level of feeding  should  then be reduced  by half for 
the next ten days and phased  out completely,  with the exception  of a 
small quantity  of meals  to carry calcined  magnesite  until the end of May.
An experiment  was carried  out in 1977 when concentrates  were fed 
from March  21st to May 25th as follows :
(i) no supplementation;
(ii) 10 lbs molasses  per head per day;
(iii) 7 lbs barley  per head per day.
The cows were stocked  at 0.7 acres per cow for a 63 day feeding  period.  
The mean  calving  date of this herd was January  20th. Difficulty  was ex­
perienced  in getting  the cows to eat their respective  quantity  of feeds and 
in the molasses  group  some barley  was introduced  to entice  them to take 
their ration. Over the total period  the quantities  of feed consumed  were  
approximately  half of their allotted  allowance.  However,  the quantities  
consumed  did not influence  either  milk yield or body weight  during  the 
experimental  period.
A similar  type experiment  was carried  out from July 29th to Novern-  
ber 25th, 1976 when  cows were stocked  at 0.8 acre per cow. This experi ­
ment consisted  of three treatment  groups :
(i) control  with no feed;
(ii) 10 lbs molasses/head/day;
(iii) 7.5 lbs barley -t-2 lbs of soyabean  per head per day.
The objective  was to determine  the effects of supplementary  feeding  in 
the latter part of lactation.  The animals  on trial were milking  over 2j
70
gallons  when introduced  to their feed. The supplemented  groups in­
creased  milk production  over the control  groups  but there was no dif­
ference  between  the two types of supplementation.  The control  group  
produced  less milk and had a shorter  lactation  length.  However,  one could  
not economically  justify  this supplementation  at the end of the lactation.  
Further  studies  on this subject  are proposed.
The influence  of stocking  rate on dairy  merit
It was stated earlier  that high stocking  rate and high milk yield per 
COW were not incompatable.  The results  from an experiment  which  has 
been carried  out for three years  at the Curtin's  farm at Moorepark  demon ­
strating  stocking  rate and dairy merit  are shown  in Table 10.

Low merit  6.5 cwt
This experiment  involves  four groups  of animals,  two highly  selected 
groupis  and two groups  whose yields are close to the national  average. 
Within  each selection,  cows are stocked  at either  one acre per cow or 0.8 
acres per cow. The results  show that at one cow per acre with an input  
of over 8 cwts concentrates  it is possible  to achieve  close to 1,000 gallons  
per cow and per acre. Increasing  stocking  rate from 1 to 0.8 has depressed  
milk production  in both the high and low merit cows. This has been a 
feature  of stocking  rate work in recent  years which may well be associ ­
ated with the dry summers  experienced  in 1976 and 1977. These  depres ­
sions would  justify  increasing  stocking  rates to high levels at the present  
time. The proportion  of yield produced  Indoors  reflects  the overall  lacta ­
tion yields in the high merit cows. A useful  guide to early calving  is the 
percentage  of milk produced  between  calving  and the end of May which  
has been approximately  54% in this experiment.  This result emphasises  
the value  of early calving,  good quality  winter  feed with supplementation,  
and very good grassland  management  in the early part of the season. 
One further  pioint illustrated  by the result is the need for a long lactation  
in order  to obtain  high milk yields.
71
The influence  of early calving  is further endorsed  by the data presented 
in Table 11. These  data are taken  from some of the Moorepark  herds  and 
illustrate  that late calving  decreases  milk yield per cow and lactation  
length. When  the January  and April yields  are compared  there is a drop  
of 38 gallons  per month  for each months  delay in calving  date. The data 
from An Foras Taluntais  survey  of 700 farms in 1976 indicate  the effect  
of early calving  on milk yield as shown  in Table 12.

Control  of culling  in dairy  herds
Data from eight herds in Moorepark  were used to establish  average  
values for culling  and mortality  and to indicate  those factors  requiring  
particular  attention  in order to eliminate  mortality  and involuntary  cull­
ing. The data are based  on a period  covering  six years  from 1969 to 1975.  
Of the results  for culling  only those  cows culled  for ‘low milk production ’ 
or 'late calving ’ may be classified  as ‘voluntary  culling ’, i.e. 2.8 in the 
total culling  rate of 19.8. High losses  of animals  due to involuntary  cull­
ing will consistently  reduce  the possibility  of improving  herd milk yields 
by reducing  the number  of cows that can be culled on low yield. The 
major  cause  of involuntary  culling  is infertility.  This factor  accounted  for 
39.3%  of all culled  cows or 7.8% of all cows. The factors  that contribute  
to infertility  have been shown  to be mainly  due to repeat breeders. In 
addition,  up to 10% of cows culled  for infertility  may in fact be in calf. 
Furthermore,  the late calvers  may not have been offered  for service  for 
more than one or two services,  and this will contribute  to the number  
culled  as being  infertile  within  a compact  calving  season.  The culling rates  
indicated  in Table 14 are similar  to those obtained  by K. J. O’Farrell  (An 
Foras  Taluntais,  Moorepark)  in a recent  survey  of dairy farms  in the Fer­
moy area.

The key factor  for early compact  calving  is good heat detection.  An 
outline  of the number  of observations  required  for good heat detection  
is shown  in Table 15. Studies  at Moorepark  have shown  that the average  
duration  of heat is quite short. Over 33% of heats are less than 6 hours  
in duration,  and cows can come on heat for short periods  several  times a 
day. Thus, the importance  of frequent  heat observations  during  the day 
cannot  be over-emphasised.

Number  of replacement  heifers
The high incidence  of involuntary  culling  has allowed  very low culling 
rates of low milk producers  in Irish dairy herds. Between  18 and 20% 
of cows are culled  annually  and mostly  for reasons  other  than yield. The 
recent  figures  for replacement  heifers  from the Central  Statistic  s Office  
indicate  that the number  of in-calf  heifers  being reared is considerably  
less than 20% of the national  herd. This may have major implications  
with the eradication  of brucellosis  in the future because  present  culling 
rates on an involuntary  basis will not allow for replacement  of those  ani­
mals being  culled  for brucellosis.  If the two problems  of eliminating  low 
yielders  by the introduction  of additional  replacement  heifers and the 
eradication  of brucellosis  are introduced  to farms,  then increased  num ­
bers of heifers  must be reared. The question  then arises : where  do these 
come from?
Table 16 presents  two possible  replacement  policies.  The first example  
is a 100 cow herd in which  the cows are put in calf to dairy sires and the 
heifers  at the 20% replacement  rate are put in calf to beef type bulls,  such 
as the Angus  for easy calving.  After allowing  for mortality  and animals  
not going in calf there is a maximum  of 31 calves  available  as replace ­
ment heifers.  But these heifer  calves  could  have been born between  Janu ­
ary and July, thus making  compact  calving  for heifers  impossible  if the 
maximum  number  of animals  are selected.
In the second  example  both the heifers  (if they are bred from high- 
yielding  cows and nominated  sires they should  be good genetic  material)  
and dairy cows are bred to dairy sires. The number  of possible  heifer  
replacements  is increased  to 39 heifers  from 100 animals.  The table clearly 
outlines  the type of strategies  which must be considered  if \ve are to in­
crease the culling  for low yielders,  eradication  of brucellosis  and T.B., 
and expand  the national  herd.
Summary
In this paper a number  of factors  that affect milk yield per cow have 
been considered.  Increased  milk yields  per cow will be obtained  by breed-

ing which is long term in nature. Increasing  the weight  at first calving 
has a large influence  on initial milk yields and may have effects  on the 
total life-time  performance  of the animal. The important  management  
factors  to increase  milk yields per cow depend  on better feeding,  early  
calving,  developing  a mature  herd, good disease  control  and efficient  
milking  management.  Finally,  to allow milk yields to increase,  both 
culling  and mortality  must be improved  in all herds. The factor  of high 
infertility  alone which accounts  for between  7 to 10% of all cows in the 
country  being culled annually  will demand  greater  attention  from dairy  
farmers  in the future. It is only by selecting  more replacement  heifers 
and heifers  of high quality  that higher  milk yield per cow can be achieved.

Managing  and Motivating  the 
Dairy Worker
M. F. SEABROOK
School  of Agriculture,  University  of Nottingham.
I. Introduction
Agriculturalists  are often complacent  about  man management  because  of 
a feeling  that agricultural  workers  are more satisfied  than their industrial  
counterparts.  However,  there is growing  evidence  that this is probably  
not true and it is the deferential  position  of agricultural  workers  which  
prevents  the full expression  of their dissatisfaction  in agriculture.  The gap 
in life styles between  employer  and employee  is all too often ignored  in 
agriculture  but it is likely  in the future  to be a cause  of friction  and unrest.
The general  objective  of this paper is to discuss  man management  in 
agricultural  activities  in order to achieve  more effective  worker  perfor ­
mance. The basic theme is that men have needs,  some common  to all, 
some more specific,  and that successful  management  and motivation  is 
concerned  with identifying  these needs and providing  the right mix of 
rewards  to enable  the worker  to fulfill these needs inside  and outside  his 
work situation.
II. Definitions
A. Job Satisfaction.  A feeling  of positive  effect : produced  by satisfac ­
tion of important  needs; in conjunction  with a feeling  that these  
needs could not have been better  or more easily satisfied  in a com­
parable  job; such perceptions  being with respect  to the job as a 
whole,  i.e. satisfaction  results  from need fulfilment.
B. Job Enrichment.  Adding  additional  elements  to the job to make it 
more demanding  and rewarding;  filling higher  needs and arousing  
human  needs.
C. Motivation.  The instigation  and direction  of behaviour  aimed at 
satisfying  a need. Motivation  is the drive or urge to behave  in a cer­
tain way; the driving  force to act in a particular  manner  in order to 
achieve  certain  ends or objectives.  One may regard  motivated  be­
haviour  as extending  between  two poles.
In order to understand  motivated  behaviour  one has to consider :
a) Which  goals and outcomes  are sought  by an individual  (i.e. what  
needs  is one seeking  to satisfy).
b) What are the factors  influencing  this choice  for the individual.
c) What determines  the behaviour  a person  will be motivated  to 
adopt in order to reach the goals and outcomes  thought  desir ­
able.
D. Intrinsic  Work Factors.  Factors  associated  with the nature  of work  
itself,  e.g. feelings  of achievement,  responsibility,  recognition.
E. Extrinsic  Work Factors. Factors  associated  with the environment  
in which  the job operates,  e.g. pay and working  conditions.

111. The needs  of man
In order to effectively  manage  and motivate  the worker  one needs to 
consider  the motivation  and needs  of individual  members  of staff. There  
is no easy blue print to managing  staff. Attention  needs to be paid to 
individual  differences  and not to assume  all employees  want and react to 
the same thing,  since behaviour  is related  to the fulfilment  of needs.
Maslow,  A. H. put forward  a theory  of the hierarchy  of human  needs. 
He advanced  the concept  of five basic categories  of human  needs being 
of varying  degrees  of potency.  He asserts  as a general  principle  that the 
satisfaction  of each group  of needs is a prerequisite  to the experience  of 
the next group of needs in the hierarchy,  hence ungratified  needs moti ­
vate.
Biological  needs (the most basic needs). These may be collectively 
described  as the need to survive : the need for fresh air for food,  drink,  
warmth,  sex, etc. They are provided  for through  the medium  of eco­
nomic  rewards  in more advanced  societies.  Such basic needs  must be 
satisfied  before  a person  is motivationally  aware  of the next group  of 
needs  —
Safety  and security  needs. In the work  situation,  these needs  are mani ­
fest in a preoccupation  with redundancy,  the maintenance  of pay dif­
ferentials,  the provision  of pensions  and, particularly  in agriculture,  
security  of tenure  in farm cottages.  Once they are satisfied  attention  
is turned  to —
The need for affection.  This social  need derives  from the pleasure  of 
associating  with others,  of belonging  to a group  and conforming  to its 
rules and conventions.  The implications  for management  will concern  
the leadership  processes  of the working  group. Following  the satis­
faction  of such needs  attention  turns to —
The need  for esteem.  Maslow  distinguishes  two classes  of needs  within 
this category —firstly  the need for achievement,  for independence  and 
for a sense of personal  worth,  all of which may be described  as the 
need for self-esteem.  Secondly  there is the desire for the esteem  of 
others;  the need to earn a reputation,  to experience  recognition  and 
appreciation  in one ’s achievements.  Providing  satisfaction  of these  
psychological  needs is a most important  part of motivational  policy 
in any business.  The drive  to fulfill  these  needs  may mean  that people 
reject their working  groups  and would rather work alone than as a 
member  of a group. If fulfilled,  the person  will then become  aware  
and finally  require  fulfilment  of his —
Self-actualisation  needs. This is the highest  level of human  needs in 
the hierarchy  and in a job sense is reached  by only the fortunate  few. 
It is the need of a man to become  everything  of which  he is capable.  
The provision  of a work environment  is which each individual  may 
aspire  to his full potential  is the challenge  it gives to Management.
The general  pattern  of needs is consistent  person  to person  but these  
needs are in turn modified  by such factors  as personality,  age and up­
bringing.
78
There  are many  other  theories  of human  behaviour.  Hertzberg,  Maus-  
ner and Syndermann  (1959) put forward  the view that the factors  pro­
ducing  dissatisfaction  in the job were concerned  with non fulfilment  of 
extrinsic  factors  (e.g. pay and working  conditions)  and satisfaction  only 
arose when intrinsic  factors  were present  (e.g. achievement  and recogni ­
tion). Basically  the dissatisfiers  correspond  with Maslow ’s lower needs, 
the satisfiers  with Maslow ’s higher  needs.
The strength  of an individuals  preference  for any factor in his work  
is possibly  dependent  on the extent  to which he believes  it will help him 
to obtain  other  outcomes  which  he feels are desirable.  It also shows  that 
people  may seek one goal in order  to fulfill other  needs  and goals outside  
their work.
IV. Work  behaviour
The objective  of effective  man management  is to promote  favourable  
work behaviour.  One can assume  that the behaviour  of all workers  is 
directed  by a fairly rigid set of drives,  modified  by such factors  as early  
upbringing,  personality,  age, experience,  family commitments,  family 
pressures,  the drive to develop  an individual  role, and the role forced  
on a person  by group  membership  and management  actions.  In all these  
processes  there may be a conflict  between  group  and management  expec ­
tations  and the individual ’s personality  resources  and assets.
Theories  of work behaviour  (or motivation  theories)  need to consider  
both the objectives  sought  and the behaviour  used to reach the objectives. 
If one accepts  the basic concepts  of utility  theory  then theories  such as 
those of Vroom  (1964)  and Lawler  (1973)  help explain  behaviour.  These  
effectively  state that man chooses  that behaviour  from a number  of plans  
of behaviour,  which he expects  will provide  the best outcome  as he sees 
it in terms of meeting  the needs he had. This enables  one to consider  
that —
A) Individuals  place different  values  on various  outcomes.
B) People  have expectations  about the possibility  that a certain  effort  
will lead to a certain  behaviour.
C) People  have expectations  about the possibility  that this behaviour  
will lead to certain  outcomes.
If one considers  the determinant  of the effort a person  puts into a 
job, it is the perceived  value to the person  individually  of the likely out­
come of that effort. Thus each individual  has a distinct  set of values  
which  he places  on any likely outcome.  These  values  will be determined  
by many factors  Including  his own personality,  upbringing,  family  and 
group  pressures  and the needs he has to fulfill. Effort in order to maxi ­
mise performance  will only occur if the perceived  value of the outcome  
had the highest  value  to the person.
Expectancy  theory  states that both extrinsic  and intrinsic  factors  can 
satisfy,  and also motivate,  but some people  may be more strongly  moti ­
vated by extrinsic  factors  and some by intrinsic  factors. Secondly,  satis­
faction  is not to be equated  with motivation  but rather  that satisfaction  
will be associated  with motivation  only to the extent  that it is the result
79
of valued  rewards  that are believed  by the employee  to be contingent  upon  
the performance  to be motivated.  A person  might be satisfied  with his 
pay for example,  but pay would motivate  him to perform  well only if 
good performance  was expected  to result in increased  pay. Actions  will 
be associated  with varying  degrees  of profitability  of outcomes.  These  
outcomes  will have value for an individual  when they satisfy  needs he 
has, and the value will vary with the need strength.  In any situation  a 
person  will act so as to maximise  the expected  value of outcomes.
V. Rewards
Man has needs and society  and management  should  provide  rewards  
which  meet these needs,  i.e. if one is hungry  then food is a good reward.
The outcome  of rewards  offered  by management  are complicated  by 
the fact that it is the perceived  value of that reward  which is important  
(see Fig. 1).

There is always  a danger  of management  using its perception  of the 
value of the rewards  which  are not necessarily  the same as that perceived  
by the worker. When one considers  the link between  rewards  and the 
effort one can classify  rewards  as follows :
A) Rewards  not valued (e.g. for the individual  worker  this may be 
affiliation).
B) Rewards  valued  but not dependant  on effort (e.g. time off).
C) Rewards  valued  and dependant  on effort (e.g. recognition).
The value  of rewards  and the rewards  sought  change  over time. Gener ­
ally the greater  the value of a set of rewards  and the higher  the probabil-  
ity that receiving  each of these rewards  depends  upon effort the greater  
effort will be put into any situation.
VI. The interface  between  man and cows
The first sections  of this paper  have outlined  some of the components  
u ^'^^y in which  the worker  (or farmer)  behaves.  When  one considers  
the dairy section  there is another  important  aspect,  i.e. the relationship  
between  man and cows. Analysis  of observations  made  on cow and cow­
men behaviour  show  that personality  traits  of cowmen  are correlated  with 
herd yield and that all factors  being  equal the confident  introvert  person-  
ality type (behaviour)  tended  to develop  a better relationship  with cows  
and that this good relationship  between  man and cows significantly  in­
creased  the milk yield of cows.
A nalysis
Some  forty commercial  Friesian  herds  operating  as one man units  have 
personality  of the cowman  analysed.  The herds  with 
50 - 80 cows, autumn  calving  and feeding  1,400 - 1 600 kgs per cow/year
u feed,  were isolated  and for the twenty  herds in the category
the following  emerges.

The general  symptoms  of a good relationship  
between  man and cow
a) Cows  come more easily  to the collecting  yard.
b) Cows  come more easily  into the parlour.
c) Cows  are less restless  and dung less in the parlour.
d) The cowman  pats and touches  the cows.
e) The cows do not move  away when approached  by the cowman.
f) The cows come  to the cowman  when  out in the field (short  flight  
distance).
B. The behaviour  to adopt
It is now possible  to draw up a generalised  check  list of the desirable  
factors  to look for when selecting  a new cowman.
However,  these are difficult  traits to assess and there are really very 
many other factors  to consider  and which may have important  results. 
Also many farmers  do the milking  themselves  or have a herdsman  who 
seems  to be very satisfactory  even if he does not totally  match  up to the 
generalised  specification.  The more satisfactiry  solution  is to modify  the 
farmer  and cowman ’s behaviour  so that he achieves  a better  relationship  
with his cows. This can be done by ensuring  that certain  activities  which 
cows dislike  are avoided  and certain  activities  which they like are de­
veloped.  This should  have a beneficial  effect on milk yield.
Cows can be made to like their cowman  by receiving  favourable  
stimuli  when they are with him. If they associate  the cowman  and the 
parlour  with pleasant  sensations  they will come in willingly,  want to be 
with the cowman  and be under  less stress whilst  there.
The following  is a part of the behaviour  modification  programme :
When  rounding  up the cows  for milking :
DO’S
—Walk  up to the cow quietly,
—Call to let them know your are 
rounding  them up,
—Walk  confidently  up to the cows  
and stroke  them.DO NOT ’s
—Hit cows with sticks or other  
objects,  make  them run,
—Crowd  them through  gateways, 
shout  unduly  at them.
Herding  cows  into milking  parlour :
—Allow  cows to enter parlour  un­
hurriedly  and in their  own order  
(if they hang back — find out 
why).
—Approach  those cows hanging  
back with gentle  talk and walk 
them into the parlour  with a 
confident  manner.-Confuse  or upset  cows by trying 
to rush.
82
Preparing  cows for milking :
-Let cow know where you are 
by talking  to her then stroking  
her with your hand moving 
towards  the udder,
-ALWAYS  stick to the routine  
the cow is used to.
Make special  effort to reassure  
nervous  cow or heifer,
-Ensure  your behaviour  is con­
sistent,  a given reaction  of cow 
should  always  elicit the consis-  
tant reaction  by you.Make  sudden,  unexpected  
movements,  handle udder un­
expectedly,  or roughly.
Leaving  the parlou]'  after mUking  :
—Hurry  cows out of parlour.  
Make  cows reluctant  to come  in 
next time,  due to fear of cow­
man.—Let the cows walk out at their  
own speed and in their own 
order.
—Encourage  first cow to move by 
a gentle  pat if necessary.
Calving :
The cow is particularly  sensitive  to new stimuli  at this time. Make  
sure your actions  to her are favourable  and pleasant,  as she will remem ­
ber if they are not !
DO NOT ’s 
—Be impatient,  
—Flap.DO’S
—Talk to cow in gentle  tone,
—Make steady quiet movements  
round  cow,
—Be confident  and in control,
—This is an opportunity  to create  
a relationship  of trust between  
man and cow—make a fuss of 
her, rub her udder,  scratch  her 
face, rump,  etc.
First few milkings :
During  this time the cow is under  stress and sensitive  to new stimuli,  
the routine  is changing  and she misses  her calf. You must be a substitute  
for the calf. You must encourage  her to eat as much as possible  and to 
let her milk down  freely.
—Get the cow to think that milk ­
ing is a pleasant  experience,
—Make sure you touch the cow 
gently  and speak  kindly  to her,
—Handle  udder  carefully,
—Talk to her.—Cause  cow pain or stress,
—Make  cow frightened,  or 
“dread ” milking,
—If cow knocks unit off, calm  
her down before trying to put 
unit on again.
83
In conclusion  it can be said that sensation  of pleasure  are reinforced  
by reward  feeding,  patting,  and tone of voice on approaching  cow. Un­
pleasant  feelings  are minimised  by elimination  of unfavourable  treatment,  
especially  in the parlour  and at calving.
A sound  relationship  is based  on communication  and confidence.  Thus  
the competent  cowman  on top of his job talks to his cows when they are 
under  stress,  as during  milking.  He uses a pleasant  voice but at times he 
displays  the necessary  dominance,  since cows can sense worry  in the cow­
man when he is dealing  with them.

A. Check  the formal  structure  of the farm, i.e. 
and appraisal.
Check  chain  of commands,  communication  processes,  etc. This over­
comes  the problem  of instruction  being  given by more than one per­
son.
Consider  the problems  of the interface  between  animal  and man on 
the dairy farm.
Look at the jobs on the farm and modify  if necessary  using the fol­
lowing criteria which includes  positive  consideration  of human  
characteristics  and needs.
a) optimum  variety  of tasks and skills;
b) some control  over methods,  pace and sequence;
c) a meaningful  and compatible  pattern  of tasks making  a recognis ­
able contribution;
d) optimum  length  of work cycle;
e) feedback  on performance,  as far as possible  through  the work 
itself;
f) opportunity  for learning  and development;
g) opportunity  for contact  and collaboration  with others.
D. Consider  and rate each job on the following  criteria ;
Skill variety  “
Task identity — 
Task significance  — 
Autonomy  —
Feedback
KnowledgeThe degree  to which  skill variety  is necessary 
in a job.
How far the job is a complete  entity.
The impact  of the job on the lives of others. 
The degree to which the job provides  the 
worker  with independence,  freedom,  and de­
cision  making.
How much  effective  feedback  occurs.
Degree  to which knowledge  is acquired  re­
lated and used.
Atternpt  to put yourself  in the place of the person  being managed,  
examine  the following  points :
Communications :
i worker  must have knowledge  of aims of the business;
ii worker  must have information  to do job well;
iii worker  must pass on information  to supervisors;
iv worker  must feel action  is taken  on information  given.
84
b) Personal  Relationship :
i teamwork;
ii close  relationship  with supervisors;
iii help and co-operation  with colleagues;
iv worker must feel he can influence  his workplace  activities,  
methods  and standards.
c) Control :
i worker  must feel he can control  his work and methods;
ii workers  must have influence  over others whose  job affects his 
work;
iii group  consultation  on job methods;
iv checking  of work standards.
d) Leadership ;
i worker  must have confidence  in top management/immediate  
superior;
ii management  must try to understand  work problems;
iii management  must value and invite opinions  on all aspects  of 
the work;
iv workers  efforts  must be appreciated;
V a consistent  action  and reaction  is important.
e) Decision  making :
i decisions  should be made on all levels — worker  must have  
opportunity  to take decisions;
ii management  must be aware of work problems  when it makes  
decisions;
iii workers ’ ideas must influence  decisions  made.
f) Work  targets ;
i workers  must be involved  in setting  targets;
ii targets  must be clearly  defined;
iii targets  must be acceptable;
iv a sense of achievement  must be got from the job.
g) Performance  standards :
i ensure  job cannot  be improved  by using new methods;,
ii avoid  waste;
iii ensure  correct  training  given;
iv ensure  jobs as whole  well organised  (e.g. all daily jobs not just 
milking).
But at all times consider  the worker  as an individual  with individual  
needs  and aspirations.
F. Consider  needs  of worker ’s wife and family.
G. The fundamental  long term problem  is that agricultural  workers  are 
finding  it increasingly  difficult  to identify  with the goals and objec ­
tives of the organisations  which employ  them. Until the worker  is 
able to modify  the goals and objectives  of the organisation  he will 
have no incentive  to put his best into the job.

Control  of Brucellosis

Introduction
Mr. Chairman,  I wish to express  my thanks  to the trustees  for inviting  me 
to give this Seventh  Edward  Richards  - Orpen Memorial  lecture.
A National  Brucellosis  Eradication  scheme  was begun in Ireland  in 
1966. The position  in 1977 is that six counties  have been declared  free 
and eight counties  are undergoing  compulsory  blood  testing  in the clear ­
ance area. The remaining  12 counties  can avail of the Voluntary  Brucel ­
losis Pre-Intensive  scheme  which was designed  to prepare  the way for 
compulsory  measures.  Northern  Ireland  also has a Brucellosis  Eradica ­
tion programme  which was commenced  in 1964 and is nearing  comple ­
tion.
Ireland  is an island and there are strict controls  on the import  of 
livestock.  Therefore  the problem  is one from within  the country. The 
northern  half of the island  is almost  free of Brucellosis,  but has a popula ­
tion of susceptible  animals  while the southern  half has a high prevalence  
of the disease. In order to improve  this situation  immediate  steps must  
be taken  to reduce  the disease  prevalence  in the southern  counties  thereby  
removing  the source  of further  infections  in the cleared  areas.
The pressure  of eradication  must be maintained  and even accelerated  
to achieve  a successful  conclusion*'*.  All herdowners  must be informed  
about  the reasons  for following  the eradication  programme*^*.  Most of all 
we must strive for an understanding  of the disease.
History  of the disease
Brucellosis  is a disease  of animals  and man. It is caused  by highly  con­
tagious  Brucella  organisms.  Formerly,  the disease  in the bovine was 
called ‘contagious  abortion ’. This name accurately  described  the prin­
ciple symptoms  and acted as an immediate  warning  of the nature  of the 
disease.  As far back as 1807 “The Complete  Farmer ”, a journal  of the 
time, described  the contagious  nature  of the abortion  and the isolation  
procedures  which should  be undertaken.  However,  the cause of the dis­
ease was not identified  until 1887 when a British  doctor,  named  Bruce,  
and his wife isolated  an organism  from goats milk which  was being  sup­
89
plied to the British  forces  stationed  on the island  of Malta. Large num ­
bers of the troops  contracted  “Malta Fever ”, later to become  known  as 
Brucellosis.  Bruce stopped  the supply  of goat ’s milk and the incidence 
of new infections  dropped  dramatically.
In 1897 Bang and Stribolt  isolated  an organism  from aborting  cows  
which was able to reproduce  the disease  in healthy  stock. The causal  
organism  of “contagious  abortion ” was identified.  It was not until 1918 
that an American  bacteriologist  Alice  Evans  suggested  that the organisms  
described  by Bruce and Bang were very similar. This was subsequently  
proven  to be the case and the group  of organisms  was called Brucella  in 
honour  of Bruce  who first identified  them'^'.
Several  types are now recognised  the first being Brucella  melitensis  
which  caused  “Malta  Fever ” in man. Brucella  abortus  causes  contageous  
abortion  in cattle.  Brucella  ovis in sheep.  Brucella  suis in pigs and Bru­
cella canis is found in dogs. In Ireland  today only Brucella  abortus  is 
identified,  causing  abortion  in cattle and providing  the sole source of 
human  infection.
The disease
Brucellosis  in the bovine  exhibits  one principle  symptom,  i.e. abortion.  
The first abortion  can occur  once cows  reach  exactly  five months  pregnant.  
A majority  of the abortions  are seen around  the seventh  month. A cow 
will usually  abort  only once and then become  a “carrier ”. Some cows  may 
abort  a second  and occasionally  even a third time.
In the bovine,  infection  is usually  picked  up through  the mouth.  Occa ­
sionally  infection  may occur  through  cuts on the skin or by splashes  into 
the eye. This can be called  “direct  infection ”. If a positive  animal  calves  
or aborts unnoticed  and unrestricted,  pasture,  feed and drink may be 
contaminated  by the infected  discharges  of that animal. Cattle subse ­
quently  feeding  or drinking  the contaminated  material  could becorne  in­
fected. This can be called  “indirect  infection ”. A third pathway  of infec ­
tion is through  “latency ” where  a calf is infected  at birth or soon after and 
carries  the infection  through  to adult life.
Brucella  abortus  organisms  thrive and multiply  in the pregnant  ani­
mal. They only survive  for limited  periods  on pasture,  in sheds,  etc. The 
pregnant  infected  animal  therefore  can be regarded  as virtually  the source 
of infection.  All the discharges,  foetus  and placenta  passed  at an infected  
calving  or abortion  contain  millions  of brucella  organisms.  Over 90% 
of the total infection  is passed  at the actual  calving  or abortion.  There ­
fore such animals  must be placed under restriction  to prevent  further  
spread  of the disease.
Brucella  organisms  are easily killed by heat, drying  and the common  
disinfectants.  They survive  longer in the cold and could overwinter  if 
frozen. This is unlikely  to happen  under  Irish conditions.  The organisms  
will usually  die out within  two months  in sheds or growing  pasture  and 
within  three months  on land in winter.
The source  of the disease  and the time of spread  is known.  Therefore  
it should be possible  to initiate  management  procedures  to bring about  
its control.

The key to controlling  the disease  is to “break the cycle ” of infection  
which  occurs  from year to year. The basic aim it to restrict  the positive  
cow and her infected  discharges  at calving  or abortion  and secondly  to 
maximise  within-herd  resistance  to the disease.  This can be achieved  by 
using simple  management  procedures  based on the following  principles.
The management  procedures  come under  five principle  headings :
(1) Identification
(2) Separation
(3) Calving  facilities
(4) Vaccination
(5) Disinfection
(1) Identification
There  are two main tests for identification  of brucellosis  positive  cows  
in Ireland.  The first, which is used in the Eradication  area, is the Blood  
Test. All blood  samples  are tested  at the National  Brucellosis  Laboratory,  
Dept, of Agriculture,  ‘Thorndale ’, Dublin  9. The positive  cows are ear- 
punched  and sent for immediate  slaughter  while the remainder  of the 
herd is put under movement  restriction  or ‘locked  up’ and re-tested  until 
clear.
The second  test which  is used in the Pre-Intensive  scheme  area is the 
Milk Ring Test. This is carried  out on bulk (churn)  milk samples  at the 
creamery  and on the individual  cows in positive  herds.  Under  this scheme, 
where cows are likely to be kept for a period,  positive  cows should  be 
marked  with an easily identifiable  coloured  ear tag. neck band or code 
number.  This will Indicate  the brucellosis  status  of the cows to anybody  
herding  the animals.
(2) Separation
The principle  method  of spread  of brucellosis  is by direct  contact  be­
tween negative  animals  and the infected  products  passed  at an infected 
calving  or abortion.  It is recommended  therefore  that once the positive 
cows are identified  plans should  be made to separate  the positive  and 
negative  cows. Ideally,  this should  be done as soon as pregnant  ariirnals  
reach  four and a half months  gestation.  This will eliminate  the possibility  
of direct  contact  between  positive  and negative  animals  should  an abor ­
tion occur unnoticed.  If separation  is not possible  at this time then the 
cows must be carefully  herded. A separation  may be possible  once the 
cows go dry. Positive  and negative  cows should  never be run together  at 
the same silage face.
In the spring  calving  herds a farmer  chooses  a date on which  to com­
mence  serving  his cows. He can then put a reminder  on his calendar  of 
the separation  date, four and a half months  later. In a herd where  cows  
have been calving  all the year round a farmer  can choose  two dates for 
commencement  of service,  one for his ‘spring ’ herd and one for his 
‘autumn ’ herd. He will then be in a position  to know the dates on which 
his cows will reach four and a half months  pregnant.
91
Under  the Eradication  Scheme  positive  cows should  be totally  isolated 
because  the remainder  of the herd are highly  susceptible  (non-vaccinated)  
cows. Under  the Pre-Intensive  scheme,  vaccination  with the killed  45/20  
adjuvant  vaccine  (K45/20A)  is widely practised,  earnestly  encouraged  
and is mandatory  for replacement  heifers. With these animals  separation  
can be effective  with as little as an electric  fence. However,  the best 
separation  possible  should  be used on each farm. Positive  cows could be 
grazed  on separate  land or on the paddock  behind  the grazing  rotation.  
Separate  wintering  arrangements  must be made to avoid putting  positive 
and negative  cows together  at the silage  face.
Herding.  The times  at which  Brucella  abortions  may occur  have been 
pointed  out. There  are definite  signs to be seen pre-abortion.  The prin­
ciple signs are : (1) sudden  springing  of the udder,  (2) slime at the vulva 
or on the hind quarters,  (3) dropped  pin bones (raised  tailhead),  (4) un­
usual uneasiness.  Pregnant  animals  showing  any of these signs should  be 
isolated  until they either abort or settle down. The important  point in 
herding  pregnant  animals  is to inspect  the hind quarters.  This should  be 
done twice a day.
(3) Calving  facility
The first requirement  in a brucellosis  positive  herd is that a separate  
calving  facility  be provided  for positive  and negative  animals. These  
facilities  should be sited carefully  away from the main farm road and 
with safe drainage,  preferably  into a separate  soak pit. It is also essential  
that there should  be no contact  between  positive  and negative  units either  
directly  or via the drainage.
A calving  facility  can be any of the following :
(a) Individual  calving  box
(b) Tie up shed
(c) Calving  shed
(d) Loose  house
(e) Small  field or paddock
(a) The individual  calving  box is ideal. All of the discharges  passed  
at the calving  or abortion  will be restricted  and the box can be easily 
cleaned  and disinfected.  Even where individual  boxes are available  a 
certain  number  should  be allotted  to the positive  cows and only positive 
cows should  be calved  in them. These would be the boxes next to the 
drainage  outlet.
Many buildings  have become  redundant  due to changes  in manage ­
ment, i.e. self feed layout. These buildings  could be converted  into calv­
ing boxes  to reduce  the overall  cost, provided  they are suitably  sited and 
drained.
(b) The tie up shed or cow byre is a very good system  for confining 
the pregnant  and calving  cow. The positive  cows should  be tied together,  
next to the drainage  outlet and by expected  calving  date. The negative  
cows can be tied in the shed with an empty standing  between  the two 
groups. The negative  cows should also be tied according  to expected  
calving  date. This will avoid the possibility  of cows in mid or early preg­
nancy  becoming  infected  and having  an abortion.
92
(c) A calving  shed which is divided  by gates into boxes  can be used 
for one or other group. Sheeting  the gates with galvanised  iron or hard-  
board  would  be a useful  addition.
(d) A small field or paddock  could be used for either  group. This 
paddock  should  not be grazed  for three months  following  the last calving.
Any of the above  facilities  or any combination  of them may be used 
successfully.
Note : The best facility  should  always  be used for the negative  cows  
in case one is incubating  the disease  and has not been identified  as in­
fected. This will help to minimise  or eliminate  further  spread  of infection.
(4) Vaccination
In the case of brucellosis  only a dead vaccine  has been used in Ireland  
since 1968. This is called  the killed strain  45/20  adjuvant  vaccine  (K45/  
20A). The aim of any vaccination  programme  is to prevent  infection  tak­
ing place. Therefore  the vaccine  should be given before animals  are 
exposed  to infection.  Vaccination  of heifers  against  brucellosis  should  
be carried  out when they reach 12 months  of age. A primary  (essential) 
course of vaccination  comprises  two inoculations  given 6 to 12 weeks 
apart. This should  be completed  before  the heifers  are served.  In infected 
herds,  with abortions  occurring  each year, booster  vaccination  should  be 
given annually.  In herds without  infection  booster  vaccination  can be 
given every 18 months  or two years. This vaccination  should  be given 
when cows are non-pregnant  so as to try and prevent  infection  taking  
place.
It is now widely  accepted  that some of the cells in the immune  system 
of the animal  which  are sensitised  by vaccination  can live for 10 years or 
more. Therefore  the protective  effect of brucellosis  vaccination  can be 
expected  to reduce,  slowly,  over a number  of years.
(5) Disinfection
Brucella  organisms  are quite easily killed by disinfection.  Disinfec ­
tants should  be made  up according  to the manufacturer ’s specification  and 
renewed  regularly.  The Department  of Agriculture  publishes  a list of 
approved  disinfectants  for various  diseases,  including  brucellosis,  and 
gives the dilution  rates at which  they should  be used.
A foot dip (basin,  bucket,  small trough,  etc.) should  be placed  outside  
each calving  facility.  Boots  should  be dipped  going  in and coming  out of 
each area. All the bedding  from the calving  facilities  should  be sprayed  
with disinfectant  (sprayer,  sprinkling  can, etc.) before  removal  and stacked  
separately.  Calving  boxes, especially  those used for the negative  cows,  
should  be cleaned  out and disinfected  between  calvings.
When  an abortion  or calving  occurs  amongst  a group  of animals,  the 
cows should  be removed  immediately  and the area thoroughly  disinfected.  
If this occurs  while grazing,  the herd should  be moved  on to the next 
paddock.
Note : Once steps have been taken to control  the disease  within  the 
herd extra attention  should  be paid to the farm fencing  to ensure  that it 
remains  stockproof.
93
Brucellosis  control  programme  at Moorepark
A brucellosis  control  programme,  based  on the principles  already  dis­
cussed,  was introduced  to the six dairy herds  of the Moorepark  centre  and 
field stations  in the autumn  of 1974. All six farms  were accepted  into the 
Pre-Intensive  Scheme. The overall brucellosis  prevalence  was 20.9%,  
varying  between  herds from 12.8% to 28.9%  positive. Herd size ranged  
from 130 to 250 cows. The total number  of cows tested in 1974 was 990.
(1) Identification
Routine  blood and milk samples  were collected  simultaneously  from 
each individual  cow once the whole herd had calved  down. The milk 
ring test was repeated  six weeks later while all the cows were still in 
lactation.  The blood test was repeated  when the cows were in mid preg­
nancy. All the positive  cows were marked  with a white tag in the left 
ear.
(2) Separation
Due to other on-going  experiments  it was not possible  to separate  
cows from the middle  of the fourth month of gestation. However,  a 
reminder  was put on the calendar  to commence  careful  herding  of the 
cows from this time onwards.  In general  the positive  cows were separated  
once they went dry or as they came  off experiment.  In Herd E and a small 
group in Herd A, there was no separation  of the positive  cows. They 
remained  in their experimental  groups  for grazing  and on silage,  but were 
removed  for calving.
The positive  cows returned  to the milking  herd seven  days after they 
passed  the afterbirth,  provided  there was no obvious  discharge  from the 
vagina. Until this time the positive  cows were milked  last.
(3) Calving  facilities
The calving  facilities  were arranged  to keep the best facilities  on each 
farm for the negative  cows.
In Herd A, two four-pen  calving  sheds  were used for calving  the nega ­
tive cows. The positive  cows were tied in individual  feeding  stalls and 
calved  in a pen at the end of the row. The late calving  positive  cows were 
calved  in the lower  of the two calving  sheds.
In Herd B the negative  cows were calved  in a loose house  divided  into 
two pens while the positives  were calved  in two small paddocks.
In Herd C the negative  cows were calved in six individual  calving 
sheds  while  the positive  cows were calved  in an old cow byre.
In Herd D the negative  cows were calved  in a large shed divided  into 
six boxes,  two at each side opening  into two in the centre. The positive 
cows were calved  in a small  paddock  where  an L-shaped  galvanised  wind ­
break  was provided.
In Herd E the negative  cows were calved  in a four pen calving  shed 
while the positives  were calved  in a loose house.
In Herd F in 1974 the autumn  calving  cows calved  in a paddock  mixed 
together  before  the management  programme  began. Subsequently  positive 
and negative  cows were calved  in individual  boxes.
94
(4) Vaccination
All cows  were booster  vaccinated  annually  in the spring  until the posi­
tive cows had been removed  from the herd. Biennially  vaccination  will 
be continued  in these herds. The replacement  heifers  were vaccinated  as 
yearlings  before  being  served. They  were blood  tested  subsequently  when  
2 - 3 months  pregnant.  The ‘latent  carrier ’ would  appear  to give a positive  
result  at this stage. Such heifers  were then placed  under  restriction.
(5) Disinfection
The disinfectant  used in 1974 was “Chloros ” while “Jeyes Fluid ” has 
been used since then in all the herds. Any of the other approved  disin ­
fectants  could  also be used. Garden  sprayers  were used in 1974, 1975 for 
spraying  disinfectant  onto bedding,  cow ’s hind quarters,  etc., but were 
somewhat  fragile  and tended  to corrode.  Sprinkling  cans are now used.
The results  from the six individual  farms  are given in Table 1. Certain  
changes  in farm size and animal  numbers  occurred  which  are explained  
in the following  way. Herd A received  the majority  of both spring  and 
autumn  calving  cows from Herd F in winter  1974 and spring 1975. Some  
positive  cows were also brought  in to facilitate  the clearance  of brucellosis  
from other herds, i.e. Herd C, Herd D, Herd E and Herd F. All move ­
ments of animals  was carried  out under permit  from the Department  of 
Agriculture.
Herd C was reduced  in size due to reduction  in farm acreage.  Herd D 
was transferred  to a new farm in Spring 1977 following  the sale of all 
known  positive  cows. Herd E was reduced  in size due to reseeding  of 
half the farm. Herd F was made up of 92 heifers  which calved  as two- 
year-olds  in 1976 and the number  was increased  to 138 following  the in­
troduction  of 50 three-year-old  heifers  in 1977.
The important  features  to note in the results  are the very small number  
of new positive  cows which were identified  each year indicating  that the 
spread of the disease had been brought  under control  in each herd. 
Gradual  elimination  of positive  cows from the various  herds have left 
four herds free in summer  1977. The three positive  cows in Herd D were 
sold off. Extra replacements  have been reared and it is hoped to milk 
out the positive  cows in the remaining  two herds in 1978 and not put 
them back in calf. The new positive  cows in 1976 and 1977 are almost  
entirely  second  calvers.
The other  feature  of the results  is the high number  of positive  replace ­
ment heifers  which  were introduced  up to 1976. This problem  has been 
overcome  by the blood test which is carried  out on the heifers  at 2 - 3 
months  pregnant  as previously  described.  The three new heifers  in Herd  
D in 1977 had been exposed  subsequent  to testing.
The difficulties  experienced  at the beginning  of the control  procedures  
were: (1) the abortion  at the end of five months  gestation,  (2) the occa ­
sional very quick premature  calving  between  8 - 9 months  gestation  and 
(3) heifers  drinking  from contaminated  water supplies  (river  and stream).  
These  problems  were dealt with by putting  a reminder  for herding  on the 
calendar,  careful  and regular  observation  of heavily  pregnant  cows and 
by providing  piped  drinking  water  for the paddocks  concerned.

The overall  culling  rate was approximately  20% and was non selec­
tive for brucellosis  positive  cows.
Milk Ring Test
In order to monitor  the Milk Ring Test (MRT)  results,  simultaneous  
blood samples  were collected  from all cows. A comparison  of the Milk  
Ring Test results  with the Blood  Serum  Agglutination  test (SAT)  results 
are shown  in Tables  2 and 3. Of the 146 cows which  were positive  to the 
MRT as interpreted  under the Brucellosis  Pre-Intensive  Scheme,  96% 
had a simultaneous  SAT positive  result  (Table  2). Much  of the difference  
between  these two figures  is bridged  by looking  at the results  in Table  
4 which show that any cow giving  a reading  of 2+ (50% agglutination)  
or greater  on the neat milk has more than an 88% chance  of being  SAT 
positive.
96
These  results  show that the MRT  as interpreted  under  the Brucellosis  
Pre-Intensive  Scheme  is identifying  positive  animals  with very few excep ­
tions, i.e. where  there is a false positive  result. They also show a propor ­
tion of suspect  reactions  which  indicate  that these cows should,  at least,  
be resampled  while still in mid lactation.  The disease  is dynamic  not 
static. New cows may have become  infected  and it can take some time 
for these animals  to give a positive  result. Again,  there is the need for 
resampling.  As approximately  90% of cows become  infected  in the 
udder<5. ’) it would  appear  appropriate  that a blood test be carried  out, 
following  disposal  of the MRT  positive  cows, to finalise  accreditation  of 
the herd.
All tests were carried  out using  antigens  to E.E.C./W.H.O.  standards^*)

The ‘latent carrier ’ heifers  appeared  to be identified  by a blood test, 
as described  earlier,  carried  out after vaccination  and service  but before 
they reached  five months  gestation,  i.e. at 2 - 3 months  pregnant.  The 
figures  for 1976 - 11 (Table  5) show that the four positive  heifers  represent  
approximately  1% and come from positive  herds rather than just from 
positive  dams. Once these heifers  are identified  they must be removed 
and placed  under  restriction.  The remaining  heifers  should  still be herded  
carefully  in case of subsequent  exposure.  It is the early unnoticed  abor ­
tion amongst  a group  of heifers  which can lead to a high number  of in­
fected  replacement  animals.

Discussion
The results  obtained  over three years in Moorepark  using basic man­
agement  techniques  in the control  of Brucellosis  suggest  that such pro­
cedures  will give a satisfactory  outcome  for the extra amount  of thought  
and effort required  to operate  them. Control  is not 100 per cent but it so 
radically  slows down the spread of the disease  that by selling off the 
known  positive  animals  the source  of spread  within  the herd is eliminated.  
Thus your problem  is reduced  to a minimum  at which  stage eradication  
is very possible.
The approach  to be adopted  is very straightforward.  The extent  of the 
problem  must be discovered  by testing the herd and the within herd 
resistance  must be maximised  by vaccination.  Then,  the farmer  can de­
cide, with the help of his Veterinary  and Agricultural  advisers,  how he 
can handle  the separation  and calving  of positive  and negative  cows on 
his farm. All a herdowner  can do is to use the facilities  which  are already  
available  on the farm. He should  plan and organise  for any necessary 
improvements  and herd the pregnant  animals  carefully  at the appropriate  
times.
A knowledge  of the disease  pattern,  which  is very consistent,  gives the 
farmer  the opportunity  to intervene  at the appropriate  time and ‘break  the 
cycle ’ of the infection,  thereby  bringing  Brucellosis  under  control.  Once 
he can control  the disease  he can plan a culling  and replacement  pro­
gramme  to eliminate  the disease  as quickly  as is economically  possible. 
Three  years should  be the maximum  timescale  for any herd.
The Pre-Intensive  Brucellosis  Scheme  has been in operation  since 1973 
based  on the Milk Ring Testing  (MRT)  of bulk milk at the creamery  and
98
the individual  cows in positive  herds. The aim of this Pre-Intensive  or 
Pre-Eradication  Scheme  is to reduce  the pool of infection  in advance  of 
the compulsory  blood test and slaughter  policy. It has not suceeded  in 
its aim despite  the supportive  intervention  of the major Co-Operatives.  
Therefore  we find ourselves  in the position  that most of the 12 counties  
in the non-eradication  area still have too high a prevalence  of the disease.
One half of the country  has very little brucellosis  and the other half 
has a high prevalence.  It is unrealistic  to expect  that further  progress  can 
be made in the Eradication  areas while the remainder  of the country  has 
such high infection  levels. We must concentrate  and accelerate  our efforts  
in the southern  counties  in order to reduce  the source  of spread  of the 
disease.  What I would  suggest,  keeping  in mind the ability  to control  the 
disease  and the time necessary  for the economic  removal  and replacement  
of positive  animals,  is a three year Compulsory  Pre-Intensive  Scheme,  to 
be followed  immediately  by compulsory  blood test and slaughter.
During  the three year period  dairy herds would  continue  to be MRT  
tested  along  the lines I have suggested  and the beef herds  could be tested  
by an accurate,  rapid and cheap  screening  blood  test. All positive  animals  
would be punched  and their identity  cards collected.  Bonuses,  as now,  
would  be paid on slaughter  of these animals.  A clear blood  test would  be 
the accredtiation  test for all herds.
This would  mean that as many positive  animals  as possible  would  be 
identified  quickly  and their access  to the open market  restricted.  It would 
give time for the rearing  of extra replacements  to maintain  stock  numbers  
and positive  cows could be milked  out and culled  at the end of lactation.  
The use of the brucellosis  vaccine  (K45/20A)  would  continue  and should  
be greatly  encouraged  over this period  to boost  within  herd resistance.
Brucellosis  is dynamic  not static. We must keep the pressure  on to 
reduce  the disease  prevalence.  This point is emphasised  by Hugh-Jones  
in his recent “Evaluation  of Brucellosis  Eradication  in England  and 
Wales” <^>. He also emphasised  the need for the constant  review  of eradi ­
cation  policy. We have a very good series  of tests available  which  can be 
strategically  applied  to the problems  of the individual  herd. All we need 
is the will to do the job and the confidence  that we will be successful.

SWARD  PROCESSES  UNDER  GRAZING  
A. J. BRERETON
The Agricultural  Institute,  Johnstown  Castle,  Wexford.
A grazed  perennial  ryegrass  (S24) sward  was analysed  in detail  during  
13 months  from 1st February  1977 until late Marsh  1978. In the analyses, 
emphasis  is being placed  on the identification  and quantification  of the 
factors  affecting  daily grass growth  rate during  the rest period. The fac­
tors considered  are (a' climate,  (b) physiological  and (c) management.  
The climatically  determined  growth  rates were calculated  using relation ­
ships obtained  from published  work. Both temperature  and radiation  
markedly  depressed  growth rate before May and after September. 
Drought  depressed  growth  rates during  July and August.  The climatic ­
ally determined  rates were compared  with observed  growth  rates. The 
results  show that the calculated  growth  rate overestimates  growth  rate in 
the May-June  period  by a factor  of about  two and underestimates  growth  
rates at the end of the season  (September-October)  by a factor  of about  
two. This discrepancy  between  calculated  and observed  growth  rates is 
attributed  to the effect of flowering  which is averaged  over the season  in 
the calculated  data. The results  indicate  that the growth  rate of a repro ­
ductive  sward is three to four times as great as the growth  rate of a 
vegetative  sward. The difference  in growth  rate between  reproductive  
and vegetative  swards  was largely  due to the difference  in leaf net assim ­
ilation  rate. The difference  in leaf net assimilation  rate was only partly  
accounted  for by differences  in solar radiation  receipt.

GRASS  PRODUCTION  AND EARLY  FAT LAMB  PERFORM ­
ANCE  ON SOD SEEDED  OLD PASTURES  AT BELCLARE
E. GRENNAN
The Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
The climate  in the west of Ireland  is favourable  for the production  of 
early grass but this potential  is difficult  to exploit  where  old permanent  
pastures  predominate.  If early growing  grasses  are established  in old 
pastures  by the “stitching-in ” technique,  they could  considerably  improve  
the potential  for early grass growth.
RVP Italian ryegrass  was successfully  stitched  into old pastures  in 
1974. Pastures  were grazed  bare, sprayed  with gramoxone  at 700 ccs/ 
hectare  and RVP sown with a Bettinson  3D, (17.8 cm spacing)  at 19 
kg seed/ha  in mid-July  or early September.  A sowing  was also made  
after a silage cut in early September,  without  using gramoxone.
Establishment  of Italian  ryegrass  was satisfactory  on each site, though  
somewhat  better  on grazed  and sprayed  sites than after silage. Spraying  
pastures  in early September  reduced  autumn  growth  by about 600 kg 
D.M./ha.
Yields were measured  in 1975 and 1976 in a simulated  three cut 
silage system  on plots receiving  0, 50 or 100 kg N/ha  for each cut. Total  
yields  were highest  on stitched  in plots,  the difference  being  about  900 to 
1,500 kg/ha or 12 to 15 per cent. The benefit  of Italian  ryegrass  was 
most noticeable  in spring  and in pasture  recovery  after cutting,  especially  
during  dry periods.
Old and stitched-in  pastures  were grazed  with an early lambing  ewe 
flock from late February  through  April and stocked  at 7.5, 12.5 or 17.5 
ewes plus lambs per hectare. The extra grass on stitched-in  paddocks  
was reflected  in improved  liveweight  gain in lambs,  at all stocking  rates  
in 1975 and at the low and high stocking  rates in 1976.
The response  to stitching-in  Italian  ryegrass  looks promising,  but the 
management  of Italian  in an old pasture  in relation  to dates  of silage  cuts 
needs attention.

THE DIGESTIBLE  AND METABOLISABLE  ENERGY  OF 
GRASS  JUICE  FOR GROWING  PIGS
O. CARTON  and M. F. MAGUIRE  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
The mechanical  pulping  and squeezing  of high moisture  forage  crops  
produces  a protein  rich juice and an ensilable  high dry matter crop 
residue.  The juice contains  6-10%  dry matter  of which  30-35%  is crude  
protein  having 6.5% lysine. For grass crops harvested  at four week 
intervals  throughout  the season  the juice extract  contains  approximately  
30% of the total dry matter  production  and 45% of the crude protein.
A digestibility  trial was conducted  to establish  the digestible  energy 
(DE) and metabolisable  energy  (ME)  of grass  juice for growing  pigs. The 
grass juice was prepared  from a late autumn  cut of a tetraploid  ryegrass. 
The juice,  concentrated  to 11% DM (4.2% CP, 2.6% ash) and preserved 
with HCl and Sodium  Metabisulphite,  was used to replace  30% of the 
organic  matter  in a barley-soyabean  ration  fed in the preliminary  period.  
Five pigs of initial  weight  37-39  kg were used in metabolism  crates.
The basal diet had dry matter  digestibility  (DMD)  and organic  matter  
digestibility  (OMD)  values  of 82.1 and 89.5%  respectively.  The digestibil ­
ity of grass juice  dry matter  and organic  matter  (calculated  by difference) 
was 69.9 and 90.9% respectively.  The determined  DE and ME values  
for grass juice on a dry matter  basis were 9.89 MJ/kg  and 8.17 MJ/kg.  
The corresponding  values  on an ash-free  basis were 12.68 MJ/kg  and 
10.51 MJ/kg.

SILAGE  EFFLUENT  AS A SOURCE  OF NUTRIENTS  FOR  
THE GROWING  PIG
D. C. PATTERSON  and N. WALKER
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of Northern  Ireland.  Hillsborough.
Co. Down.
In preliminary  studies  effluent  was readily  consumed  by the pig with­
out toxic effects. In two subsequent  exfieriments  littermate  pairs of pigs 
were individually-fed  either  a meal plus water  control  diet or an effluent 
containing  diet in which silage effluent  formed  150 g/kg of dry matter  
fed. All pigs were fed to a scale based  on metabolic  body weight.
In the first experiment,  freshly  collected  effluent  from two sources  was 
offered  over a liveweight  range  of 64 to 85 kg. The daily gains  were 719, 
715 and 753 ± 16.8 g and feed : gain ratios were 3.07, 3.10 and 2.94 
± 0.075 g for the control  and two effluent  treatments  respectively.  In the 
seeond  experiment  effluent  was stored  for 3.5, 14, 28, 56, 112 or 240 days 
before  being  given  to pigs. Initial  and final liveweights  were 33 and 83 kg 
respectively.  Littermate  pairs of pigs were allocated  to a stored  effluent 
treatment  and a contemporary  control  treatment  as the stored effluents 
were not available  for testing  simultaneously.  The use of contemporary  
control  treatments  permitted  adjustment  of means  for differences  in time. 
The overall  mean daily gains on the effluent  and control  diets were 646 
and 655 ± 7.5 *g respectively.  For the same comparison  the mean  feed : 
gain ratios  (DM basis)  were 2.69 and 2.64 ±0.03 *g and subcutaneous  fat 
contents  of the rump back joint were 271 and 279 ± 5.6 *g/kg  respec ­
tively. None of these differences  were significant.  Pig performance  did 
not deteriorate  with increasing  period  of effluent  storage.
An experiment  is currently  in progress  in which  the performance  of 
pigs given an all-meal  or effluent  containing  diet is being compared  in 
both individual  and group-penning  situations.  Results  to date indicate  
that performance  on the diet containing  silage effluent  is as good as on 
the all-meal  diet in both cases.
The experimental  work to date has shown  that effluent  can replace  
150 g/kg of the dry matter  of the finisher  diet of bacon  pigs resulting  in 
a substantial  saving  in feed costs.

LABORATORY  STUDIES  ON GRASS  SILAGE
R. K. WILSON,  A. V. FLYNN  and D. COLLINS  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
About  25% of farm silages  in this country  are poorly  preserved  with 
pH values of 4.7 or greater^ In an attempt  to explain  this result the 
effects  of nitrogen  fertiliser,  wilting,  grass genera  and ensilage  technique  
on silage fermentation  were examined  in laboratory  silos.
In three experiments,  application  of N seven  weeks  before  cutting  had 
little effect on silage quality.  Wilting  was unreliable.
Grass genus had a very significant  effect. It was jTOssible  to rank 
grasses for silage making  as follows : ryegrass,  good; old permanent  
pasture,  timothy,  tall fescue,  bent grass, red fescue,  moderate;  yorkshire  
fog and cocksfoot,  poor.
Speed of filling had a large effect and slow filling,  accompanied  by 
heating  may account  for much poor silage.
Results  for 800 silages relating  grass, water soluble carbohydrate  
(WSC)  and silage pH are tabulated  and suggest  that a WSC level of 14% 
of DM (3% in juice) is required.
Physical  chemistry  calculations  show that pH in silage is largely  the 
result of interaction  of lactic acid and ammonia.

FEED FACTORS  AFFECTING  INTAKE  AND BEEF  
PRODUCTION  BY SILAGE  FED CATTLE
V. FLYNN
The Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
While it has for long been recognised  that digestibility  is the major  
factor  determining  intake and animal  production  potential  of dried for­
ages, this relationship  has been less well defined  for silages.  The apparent  
inconsistency  in the relationship  for silages has to some extent been 
attributed  to the nature  of the ensiling  fermentation  and to a depressing  
effect of extensive  fermentation  on silage intake. Consequently  it has 
often been considered  desirable  to increase  the dry matter  content  of 
herbage  by wilting  before ensiling  in order to restrict  the fermentation  
and raise the feeding  value of the silage.
Analyses  of the results  of Grange  feeding  trials in which  40 different  
but well preserved  silages  were fed show a clear relationship  between 
dry matter  digestibility  (DMD)  and production  by 400-500  kg beef cattle.  
DMD values  of 61%, 66%, 69% and 74% have been associated  with 
daily  liveweight  gains of 250 g, 470 g, 670 g and 860 g respectively.  Daily  
carcase  gain has been 560 g on several  of the silages  in the 74% DMD  
class. It must be noted that production  on 74% DMD silage is close to 
that expected  on similar  cattle over an entire grazing  season. This sug­
gests that proper  ensiling  may have little or no effect on the production  
potential  of herbage.
The results  of several  trials comparing  forages  differing  in dry matter  
content  have shown no beef production  advantage  in favour  of higher  
dry matter  forage.
An attempt  was therefore  made to quantify  the effects  of dry matter  
content  and of ensiling  per se on the intake and production  potential  of 
herbage.  During  summer  1977 two groups  of 10 cattle were fed either  
fresh grass or grass wilted for 24 hours. The trial was continued  for 15 
weeks. In the middle  of each week fresh and wilted grass, represen ­
tative of the herbage  fed in that week,  was ensiled. The silages  were fed 
in sequence  after four months  storage  to two groups  of 10 cattle. Similar 
animals  (initial  liveweight  435 kg) were used for grass and silage  parts of 
the experiment.  The mean daily dry matter intakes  of unwilted  and 
wilted grass and silage were 1.98, 1.90, 1.86 and 1.89% of mean live- 
weight. The corresponding  daily carcase  gains were 420 g, 430 g, 430 g 
and 370 g.
These results indicate  that a well preserved  silage can support  the 
same level of beef production  as the grass from which  it is derived  and 
that dry matter  content  per se does not raise the beef production  poten ­
tial of forage.

EFFECTS  OF CARBOHYDRATE  AND  NITROGEN  SUPPLEMEN ­
TATION  ON THE INTAKE  AND UTILIZATION  OF SILAGE  BY
SHEEP

The efficiency  with which nitrogen  (N) in silage is utilized  may be 
restricted  by degradation  of herbage  protein  to non-protein  nitrogen  
(NPN)  during  ensilage.  In addition,  fermentation  of soluble  carbohyd ­
rate during  ensilage  may limit the energy  available  for ruminal  microbial  
protein  synthesis.
The effect upon animal  performance  of feeding  grass silage alone or 
supplemented  with protein  (casein,  17.1g/kg  fresh silage),  NPN (urea,  
4.56g/kg)  or soluble  carbohydrate  (sucrose  20.6g/kg)  was studied  using  
12 store wether  lambs  in a triple 4x4 Latin Square  experiment.  Para ­
meters measured  included  voluntary  intake, rumen fermentation  and 
blood metabolites.  Eight  of the sheep  were kept in metabolism  cages  for 
digestibility  and balance  studies.  Each period  lasted  21 days with excreta  
being collected  over the final 10 days.
The silage used was of good quality  as indicated  by its composition  
and the performance  of animals  when receiving  silage alone. The effects  
of supplementary  casein  and urea were similar;  DM intake  was depressed  
by 12-13%  and the animals  lost weight,  whilst  levels  of rumen  NH. and 
serum urea, intake and urinary  excretion  of N were raised. Supplemen ­
tary sucrose  did not significantly  affect intake or liveweight  gain but 
reduced  rumen  pH and raised blood glucose  levels. Dry matter  digesti ­
bility, blood pH and N retention  were not significantly  affected  by 
treatment.

THE EFFECTS  OF CEREAL  PROCESSING  AND OF ZINC  
SUPPLEMENTATION  ON THE PERFORMANCE  OF LAMBS
J. L. L’ESTRANGE
Department  of Agriculturai  Chemistry,  University  College,  Glasnevin,
Dublin  9.
A factorial  design  experiment  was carried  out with 42 early weaned 
lambs fed barley based concentrate  ration in which the barley  was fed 
either whole or loose, ground  and loose or ground  and pelleted  after  
mixing  with other ingredients.  In addition,  with each main plot treatment  
the effect of a high level of zinc supplementation  (400 ppm) was com­
pared with a low level (34 ppm) in relation  to the protective  effect of 
zinc against  copper  toxicity.
Live-weight  gain was similar  for the three barley treatments  at ap­
proximately  320 g/day,  but the food conversion  ratio was significantly  
better  on the whole  barley  treatment.  This treatment  resulted  in a higher  
ratio of acetic  to propionic  acid in rumen  fluid of the lambs  accompanied  
by a higher  pH. There  was no appreciable  effect of barley  treatment  on 
the melting  point  or fatty acid composition  of subcutaneous  or perineph ­
ric fat of the lambs.
Copper  toxicity  did not occur on any treatments  but the storage  of 
copper  in liver was considerably  reduced  by the high zinc supplementa ­
tion. Copper  storage  in liver was higher on the pelleted  than on the 
unpelleted  diets. The high zinc supplementation  improved  food intake  
and live-weight  gain of the lambs. It did not affect the pH or volatile  
fatty acids in the rumen  fluid or the melting  point and fatty acid com­
position  of the carcass  fat.

REPLACEMENT  OF CONCENTRATES  WITH ROOTS  IN THE  
DIET OF EARLY  WEANED  LAMBS
S. FITZGERALD
The Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuani,  Co. Galway.
In a system  of accelerated  lamb production,  i.e. three lamb crops in 
two years, the lambs are weaned  at 5-6 wks. of age and subsequently  
reared  on a concentrate  diet. To reduce  feed costs,  two experiments  have 
been carried  out to determine  the extent that concentrates  can be re­
placed with pulped  roots in the diet of such lambs. The lambs were  
introduced  to concentrates  as a creep  feed at three weeks  of age, weaned  
onto concentrates  at 5-6 weeks and after a transitional  period of 7-10 
days were allocated  to diets in which concentrates  were replaced  by 
varying  proportions  of roots. The roots were supplemented  with soya 
bean meal to provide  16% crude protein  in the dietary  dry matter  (DM),  
similar  to the concentrate  diet, with minerals  plus vitamins  added. The 
lambs  were slaughtered  at 38 kg liveweight.
In Trial 1, the proportion  of concentrates  fed in the diet from wean ­
ing until slaughter  was 100, 75, 50 and 25% of the total DM intake.  
Intake  of concentrates  in the mixed  diets was either  restricted  or reduced  
gradually,  with roots fed to appetite.  The roots fed consisted  of a high 
DM fodder  beet variety  Monorosa  (19% DM).
In Trial 2, the proportion  of concentrates  fed was 100, 50, 25 or 5% 
of total intake. In this case a low DM root, yellow  globe mangel  (10%  
DM) was used.
Daily  liveweight  gains in Trial 1 were 284, 263, 278 and 262 g/day  on 
the diets containing  100 to 25% concentrates,  respectively.  Replacing  con­
centrates  with a high proportion  of roots (75%)  increased  days on trial 
(90 to 96 days) increased  daily DM intake/lamb  (937 to 990 g) and total 
DM intake  (86 v 98 kg/lamb)  and resulted  in an increase  in feed conver ­
sion ratio from 3.33 to 3.80 kg DM/kg  lamb gain.
In Trial 2, daily liveweight  gains were 272, 273, 265 and 260 g/day  
for diets containing  100 to 5% concentrates  respectively.  As in Trial 1, 
replacing  concentrates  with a high proportion  of roots supplemented  with 
protein  and minerals  (95%)  resulted  in a longer  fattening  period (89 v 
97 days), a higher  daily DM intake (876 v 985 g/lamb/day)  and total 
intake  (78 v 96 kg/lamb)  and an increased  feed conversion  ratio (3.31 v 
3.82 kg DM/kg  Iwt. gain). There were no differences  between  diets in 
carcass  weight,  killing  out % or gut contents  in either  trial.
The results indicate  that pulped roots, supplemented  with protein,  
minerals  and vitamins,  can substantially  replace  concentrates  in the diet 
of early weaned  lambs  at approximately  half of the cost, resulting  in only 
slight reduction  in lamb growth  rates but with an increase  in feed con­
version  rate due to the higher  DM intakes  of roots. Lambs  were able to 
consume  large amounts  of roots  even of a low DM content  at a relatively  
young age. Assuming  that the soya bean meal supplement  used was 
equivalent  to the concentrate  diet in energy  value,  then 1 kg concentrate  
DM was equivalent  to 1.2 kg root DM in terms of feed conversion  
efficiency  to liveweight  gain.

THE RELATIVE  EEFICIENCY  OF FOOD UTILIZATION  BY 
FRIESIAN  BULLS  AND STEERS

The Af’ricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
A combined  nutritional  balance  and comparative  slaughter  trial using  
20 animals  compared  Friesian  male (E) and castrate  male (C) cattle  when 
pair fed at two planes  of nutrition  (M and H) over the liveweight  (LW) 
range 130-400  kg. Animals  were placed  on nutritional  balance  on four 
occasions  during  the period. Liveweight  gains for each treatment  were 
(kg/day) : EH 1.10, EM 0.91, CH 0.93, CM 0.79. There were no sig­
nificant  differences  between  the digestive  efficiency  of bulls and steers.
Preliminary  results  for the carcass  data showed  that the bulls pro­
duced slightly  more lean meat and less fat than the steers. Chemical  
analysis  of the edible  portion  of the carcass  showed  that bulls deposited  
more protein  and significanlty  less fat. Daily carcass  protein  gain was 
significantly  higher  for the bulls but daily carcass  energy  gain was not 
significantly  different.

THE GENETIC  IMPROVEMENT  OF LOWLAND  SHEEP  
J. P. HANRAHAN
The Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
The lowland  ewe population  in this country  consists  of purebred  ewes  
of lowland  breeds  (mainly  the Galway  breed)  and ewes derived  from the 
hill breeds (Blackface  Mountain  and Cheviot).  Since hill breeds con­
tribute  to the lowland  population,  their role must be examined  when  
considering  the genetic  improvement  of this population.  It is well estab ­
lished  that biological  efficiency  and economic  efficiency  are both strongly  
influenced  by variations  in the number  of lambs reared  per ewe. That  
this aspect  of our lowland  sheep  population  needs  to be improved  is clear  
when our ewe flock performance  is compared  with that of the United  
Kingdom  and N. Ireland. The following  results  emerge  when the per­
formance  of lowland  spring  lambing  flocks  is examined  :
No. of lambs  reared  per ewe to the ram
U.K.  — 1.43
N. Ireland  — 1.35
Ireland  — 1.20
Our level of output  per ewe is 20% below  that in the U.K. From  the 
results of ewe breed comparisons  in Ireland  and the U.K., it can be 
concluded  that most of the difference  between  the two countries  is due 
to the genetic  limitations  of our main lowland  breed —the Galway.
A long term selection  experiment  for increased  litter size has been 
underway  in a Galway  flock since 1964 and to-date  a response  of 15% 
has been achieved.  However,  while  this shows  that within  breed selection 
can increase  litter size, the rate of improvement,  when  viewed  against  the 
required  improvement  in the national  flock, is such that this approach  
is not likely  to generate  appreciable  change  in the national  Galway  flock  
before  the end of the present  century.  Consequently,  immediate  improve ­
ment of the Galway  breed  must be pursued  through  crossing  to introduce  
genes for increased  prolificacy.  Results  under research  and commercial  
conditions  have shown  that f Galway  x ^ Finn ewes give an increase  of
0.3 to 0.4 in litter size compared  with the Galway.  In addition,  gross 
margin  per ewe has increased  by up to 40%.
It is concluded  that, since the hill breeds  are more prolific  than Gal­
ways (under  lowland  conditions),  crossbred  ewes from hill breed  mothers  
should  form as large a portion  as possible  of the lowland  population.  The 
remainder  of the lowland  flock shou ’d be improved  Galway  types like the 
J Galway  x J Finn. If this objective  was attained  and improved  ram 
strains  were used as sires of the crossbred  ewes, then lambs  reared  per 
ewe could be rapidly  increased  to 1.45 for our lowland  sheep  industry.

During  the autumn  of 1977, 46 adult ewes were treated  with a horse  
anterior  pituitary  extract  (HAP)  in association  with intravaginal  proges ­
tagen to induce multiple  ovulation.  The ewes were bred by artificial  
insemination  at a predetermined  time after the end of HAP treatment.  
Prostaglandins  (PGF 2Q! and E2) were added to the diluted  semen used 
in the insemination  of 17 sheep. Laparotomies,  performed  for the pur­
pose of egg recovery,  showed that all of the inseminated  ewes had 
ovulated,  shedding  a total of 362 eggs of which 246 were recovered.  
Addition  of prostaglandins  to semen resulted  in a significantly  higher  
percentage  of fertilized  eggs.
A total of 43 fertilized  eggs which had been stored in the ligated 
rabbit  oviduct  were transferred  at rates of one to four {ter animal  to the 
uterine  horns of 18 adult recipient  ewes using local anaesthesia  and a 
laparotomy  crad'e  for rapid egg transfer;  12 ewes became  pregnant  with 
a total of 25 foetuses.
FACTORS  AFFECTING  OESTROUS  BEHAVIOUR  IN BEEF
CATTLE

Difficulty  in detecting  oestrus is a limiting  factor in the use of 
artificial  insemination  in beef cattle. Oestrus  behaviour  was induced  in 
ovariectomised  (OVX)  beef heifers  using  oestradiol  cyclopentylpropionate  
(ECP)  and the time from ECP injection  to onset  of oestrus  behaviour  and 
the duration  of oestrous  behaviour  was recorded.
ECP administration  at various  times in relation  to the removal  of a 
progesterone  releasing  intravaginal  device  (PRID)  showed  that adminis ­
tering  ECP 24 hours  before  PRID  removal  significantly  increases  the time 
from ECP injection  to onset of oestrous  behaviour.  An injection  of 
progesterone  at the onset of oestrous  behaviour  significantly  shortened  
its duration  in OVX heifers  given ECP but did not shorten  the duration  
of oestrus  following  PRID  removal  in intact  heifers.  In the intact  heifers, 
the interval  from the end of oestrus  to ovulation  was longer in those  
that received  progesterone  at the onset of oestrus  than in those that did 
not.
Subjecting  the OVX heifers  to stress before ECP injection  did not 
affect either the time from ECP injection  to the onset of oestrus  behav ­
iour or the duration  of oestrus  behaviour.

IRISH  PIGS

The improvement  of the pig as an efficient  meat producing  animal  
has been associated  with two closely  related  problems,  namely,  an in­
crease  in the susceptibility  to stress  which  may cause  sudden  death  during  
handling  and transport  for example,  and an increasing  incidence  of pale,  
soft and exudative  (PSE)  meat which  is an undesirable  raw material  for 
manufacturing  processes.
In recent  years Dutch  research  workers  have found  that stress  suscep ­
tible pigs show an adverse  reaction  to the anaesthetic  gas halothane.  As 
a result of this, a specific  test has been developed  whereby  pigs which  
react positively  to halothane  are considered  to be susceptible  to stress 
and likely  to produce  PSE meat.
A total of 464 young pigs entering  one of the two national  testing  
stations  have been subjected  to the ‘halothane  test ’ between  October  
1976 and February  1978, comprising  350 Landrace,  66 Large  White  and 
48 Irish Welsh. The average  weight  at testing  was 24,5 kg. A total of 19 
pigs reacted  positively  to the test, 16 (4.6%)  of the Landrace  and 3 (6.3%)  
of the Irish Welsh. No reactors  were found  in the Large  White  breed.
Meat quality  data in the form of pHj readings  were analysed  for 549 
pigs (castrates,  females  and culled boars) from the two national  test 
stations  for the period  May 1976 to January  1977. The mean  pH, values  
were 6.14 ± .02 (258 pigs), 6.31 ± .02 (284 pigs) and 6.12 ± .12 (7 pigs)  
in the Landrace,  Large White and Irish Welsh  breeds  respectively.  The 
pH, in eight slaughtered  reactor  pigs was 5.88.
While the incidence  of reactors  was relatively  low in Ireland,  it was 
concluded  that in order to prevent  an increase  in the incidence  of halo­
thane sensitivity  and the undesirable  effects  associated  with this condition,  
all young boars of the Landrace  and Irish Welsh breeds  submitted  for 
performance  testing  should  be routinely  tested with halothane,  and that 
reactors  should  be culled.

EFFECT  OF TEMPERATURE  AND HUMIDITY  ON SOWS  
AND LITTERS

Two experiments  were carried  out in controlled  environment  rooms  
at Moorepark.  The first experiment  involved  16 sows at each of two 
temperatures  27°C and 16°C from day 110 of pregnancy  to weaning  at 
31 days old. Sow feed intake  was significantly  higher  (P<0.01)  and lacta ­
tion weight  loss lower (P<0.05)  at 16° C. The newborn  pigs at 16°C  
had lower rectal temperatures  at 12 hrs (P<0.01)  and 36 hrs of age 
(P<0.05),  and were heavier  at weaning  (P<0.05).  Sow respiration  rate 
and rectal temperature  were higher at 27°C both before farrowing  
(P<0.01,  P<0.10  respectively)  and after farrowing  (P<0.01  and P<0.05).
In the second  experiment  two levels  of humidity  75-80%  and 67-70% 
RH were compared  at 27°C with 24 sows on each treatment.  None  of the 
parameters  measured  including  sow feed intake,  sow weight loss, sow 
respiration  rate and rectal  temperature,  was significantly  affected  by treat ­
ment.
INHIBITORY  SUBSTANCES  IN MILK

The presence  of antibiotics  in milk is an inevitable  consequence  of the 
treatment  of dairy cows with these drugs. The persistence  of antibiotic  
residues  depends  upon the antibiotic  itself, the complete  formulation  of 
the product,  the route of administration  to the animal  and is further  sub­
ject to wide individual  variations  within  the animal  itself.
There is intense  competition  in the veterinary  antibiotic  market  with 
at least 40 separate  organisations  marketing  their own brand of product.  
There  are at least 70 different  formulations  of intramammary  tubes  on the 
market  with a further  86 or more injectable  preparations  of antibiotics.  
Each one of these products  require  to be tested to determine  effective  
withholding  times for milk.
The market  requirement  for milk is that it should  be free from anti­
biotics,  i.e. there is a zero tolerance  set for the presence  of antibiotics  in 
milk. Reputable  scientists  recognise  that this is a scientific  impossibility  
and merely  means  that no antibiotic  must be detected  in milk irrespec ­
tive of what test is used. The tests used to detect antibiotics  in milk 
are generally  non-specific  in nature  and are referred  to as tests for inhibi ­
tors. The TTC and Inter tests have been widely  accepted  both here and 
in the U.K. for a number  of years. However,  a newer  more sensitive  test 
known  as the DELVO  P test is now gaining  broad  acceptance  in Ireland  
and is creating  problems  for the pharmaceutical  industry,  the milk pro­
ducer  and the consumer.  Attempts  to clarify  some of the issues  involved 
were discussed.

Grass and Legume  Cultivars  to 
Maximise  Production  of High  
Quality  Silage
M. A. M. do VALLE  RIBEIRO  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Oak Park Research  Centre,  Carlow.
The scarcity  of silage  in Ireland  is aggravated  by its generally  poor qual ­
ity. The aim of this paper is to show how the use of bred cultivars  of 
grass and legume  herbage  species  when properly  managed,  can produce  
high yields of good quality  silage and consequently  improve  animal  per­
formance.
Grasses
Ryegrasses  are the mainstay  of reseeded  Irish pastures  and therefore,  
this paper  will be dealing  only with cultivars  of the three ryegrass  species.
The quality  assessment  of the ensiled  herbages  is based  on its in vitro  
digestibility.  This is measured  in terms of D-value,  which  is the percen ­
tage of in vitro digestible  organic  matter  in the total dry matter.
It is well known  that as grass grows  during  spring  and early summer,  
the yield of dry matter  increases  but the digestibility  falls. This fall is 
slow at first but reaches  about  0.4 digestibility  units per day as the grass 
matures.  The increase  in yield of dry matter  during  this period  may be 
100-200  kg per hectare  per day. Consequently,  a delay  of one week in the 
time of cutting  can produce  a considerable  deterioration  of the silage  
quality. As greater  emphasis  is being placed  on quality  the right time 
for cutting  is when the digestibility  of the herbage  reaches  67D value.
The average  date of first cut of 67-D herbage  varies  with the ryegrass 
species  and within  perennial  ryegrass  with the maturity  group  of the cul- 
tivar. Thus,  early and medium-early  cultivars  of perennial  ryegrass  should  
be harvested  between  20 to 25 May, medium-late  cultivars  on the first 
days of June, late types on the second  week in June and the very late, 
such as Endura  and Angela,  between  15 to 20 June. Cultivars  of Italian  
and hybrid  ryegrasses  should  be cut on 20-25 May. Regarding  tetraploid  
perennial  ryegrasses  the fall in digestibility  is slower  than in the diploid  
cultivars  and their digestibility  at heading  is higher  than that of diploid  
cultivars  with similar  date of heading.  Therefore,  the inclusion  of tetra ­
ploid cultivars  in mixtures  for conservation  is advisable.
There are some situations  in which a quality  level other than 67-D 
has to be adopted.  So, in dairy farms  which  aim at high milk production  
the herbage  ensiled  must have a D-value  not lower  than 70. There  is also 
the case in which it suits a farmer  best to cut a larger  bulk of moderate  
quality  silage and therefore  the 63-D level should  be more appropriate.  
The time of the first harvest  is affected  by weather  conditions.
Spring  grazing  reduces  the yield of the first silage cut and delays 
heading  and the date at which  a grass  reaches  a given  D-value.  The delay 
does not normally  exceed  a week  and depends  on the date when  the sward 
is closed  for silage. In areas of early spring  grazing  which  can be closed 
at the end of March  or first week of April the use of a mixture  based on 
early or medium-early  cultivars  is recommended.  This gives a first cut 
with a reasonably  high yield of good quality  silage at the end of May.  
When,  on the other hand, a pasture  cannot  be closed  until late April the 
use of medium-late  or late cultivars  is advisable.
Two large scale experiments  in which  ryegrass  cultivars  were assessed 
in terms  of silage  and beef production  have been carried  out at Oak Park  
and the results  are given in Tables  1 to 3.
Both trials were undersown  with barley,  the first in the end of March  
1970 and the second  at the beginning  of April 1975. In the first experi ­
ment an early and a medium-late  cultivar  of perennial  ryegrass.  Oriel and 
Spirit,  together with Lemtal  Italian  ryegrass,  were compared  under a 3-cut  
silage management.  In the second.  Oriel was replaced  by the medium- 
early cultivar,  Oakpark,  and the management  consists  of three cuts for 
the perennial  cultivars  and four cuts for Lemtal.  Nitrogen  inputs  of 280- 
325 kg N/ha per annum  were used in the first trial and 395 kg N/ha  are 
being applied  in the experiment  in progress.  Appropriate  amounts  of P 
and K per hectare  were spread  every  year.

Data on Tables 1 to 3 show how it is possible  to obtain  very high 
yields  of good quality  silage in the first harvest  when this is made at the 
right time and under  reasonable  weather  conditions.  Thus,  a delay  of the 
harvest  and unfavourable  weather  conditions  caused  a deterioration  of 
quality  of the first-cut  silage  of Spirit  in 1976 (Table  3).

Regarding  the subsequent  cuts the quality  of the silage  produced  de­
pends on the length of the regrowth  interval.  For Italian  ryegrass  the 
regrowth  periods  should  not exceed  4-5 weeks  (Tables  1, 2 and 3). As a 
result  of this shortening  of the regrowth  intervals  the number  of harvests  
has to be increased  from 3 to 4 (Table  3). This reduces  the total DM yield 
and in unfavourable  years as 1975 and 1976 the amount  of herbage  col­
lected in some cuts does not repay the high cost of harvest  and ensiling. 
For perennial  ryegrass,  6-7 week regrowth  intervals  are recommended  
to produce  reasonable  yields  of high quality  silage.
Early and medium-early  and medium-late  cultivars  of perennial  rye­
grass are suitable  for the 3-cut silage  system  of conservation.  The results  
obtained  with Spirit seem to indicate  that medium-late  cultivars  are the 
most appropriate  for this type of management,  however,  unusual  hot dry 
summers  can seriously  affect the third harvest.  Thus,  in 1976 a third har­
vest of Spirit  was not possible  (Table  3).
The use of pure swards  of Italian  ryegrass  for conservation  does not 
seem advisable  with a possible  exception  when a farmer  wants  to sow a 
very short ley of 12 to 18 months.  The results  of the experiments  show 
also that when Lemtal  is undersown  with a cereal crop its DM yield in 
the first harvest  season is lower than that obtained  when it is directly  
sown in the autumn.

The 3-cut  silage  management  has a depressing  effect  on the persistency 
of perennial  cultivars  and the yields  drop substancially  after four or five 
years.
The digestibility  of herbages  at the ensiling  time is usually  higher  than 
that of the corresponding  silages and the difference  depends  on the 
efficiency  of the conservation  process.  Thus, in the Oak Park experiments  
the digestibility  of the silage  was on average  2-4 units lower  but in badly 
preserved  silages  can be 10 units lower.
The overall  mean  of crude  protein  content  for the first cut silages  was 
9.9% which is lower than the 12% requirement  of most stock. Protein  
contents  of subsequent  cuts were higher  than the 12% level.
The ryegrass  silages  produced  in 1972 and 1973, and 1976 were tested 
in winter  feeding  trials in which Friesian  steers, averaging  447 kg live- 
weight,  were fed ad libitum  without  any supplementation.  The mean 
daily liveweight  gains obtained  were as follows :

Animals  fed silages  of higher  digestibility  performed  better  than those 
fed lower digestibility  silages  and the change  of management  of Lemtal  
swards  in the second  trial resulted,  as expected,  in a great improvement  
of the animal  performance.
Legumes  
White  clover
Although  white clover  is less important  as a herbage  legume  for con­
servation  than red clover and lucerne,  its role in grass/clover  swards  
under a grazing  and conservation  management  must not be underesti ­
mated. Apart  from supplying  nitrogen  to the sward,  this legume  retains  
a very high digestibility  of about 75-D over long periods  and the fall in 
digestibility  is much slower  than for the other two legumes  and for the 
ryegrasses.  Its crude protein  content  is also very high, normally  over 
20%. Therefore,  the quality  of the silage harvested  from a grass/clover  
sward will be improved  in proportion  to the amount  of white clover  
present.
The best cultivars  of white clover  are Blanca  and Kersey  but some ­
times it is difficult  to obtain  seed and its price is very high (£6.60  per kg). 
Cultivars  Sabeda,  Grasslands  Huia and Milkanova  can be used as alter ­
natives.
Red clover
The dramatic  increase  in the cost of nitrogen  caused  by the oil crisis 
and the world shortage  of protein  have brought  renewed  interest  in red 
clover  as a special  purpose  crop. This red clover  revival  was helped  by 
the fact that at this time plant breeders  have introduced  markedly  im­
proved new cultivars,  mostly tetraploids,  which are capable  of giving  
high yields when grown  pure or with a grass companion  without  use of 
fertiliser  N for 2-3 years. On the other hand advances  in the technology  
of silage  making  solved  the problems  of ensiling  red clover.
The best cultivars  presently  available  are the four tetraploid —Hun-  
garopoly.  Red Head,  Teroba  and Tetri. There  is no significant  difference  
in yield between  these cultivars  but Hungaropoly  is possibly  more per­
sistent  than the other three. These four cultivars  are resistant  to clover  
rot. In cases of seed scarcity  tetraploid  cultivars  can be replaced  by the
diploid  cultivars  Violetta,  Sabtoron  and Kuhn which give good yields  
particularly  in areas  free of clover  rot. Red clover  has a high crude  protein  
content  (16-18%)  and is also rich in minerals,  but has a low water  soluble 
carbohydrate  content  (8-12%).
High yields are dependent  on a satisfactory  crop establishment.  In 
direct  sowing  a fine tilth, a firm weed free seed bed and a soil pH of 6 to 
6.5 plus generous  application  of phosphorus  and potassium  are basic 
requisites  for good,  even establishment.  Under  Irish conditions  red clover 
or red clover/grass  mixtures  can be sown from April to the first week in 
August. The pure-sward  is very often open and susceptible  to weed in­
vasion,  but in red clover/grass  swards  the invasion  by weeds  is reduced. 
A good establishment  can be obtained  from sowing  red clover  under a 
cereal crop which  will be harvested  as arable  silage in July. A seed rate 
of 13-18 kg/ha  should  be used for a pure stand  and for a red clover/grass  
sward 13 kg of clover mixed with 6 kg of grass per hectare  should  be 
sown. Annual  fertiliser  requirements  are 40-60 kg of phosphorus  and 
200-300  kg of potassium  per hectare.
Although  yields  of DM as high as 12 t/ha per annum  can be obtained  
from pure stands  cut three times for silage,  the use of mixed  red clover/  
grass swards  is recommended.  The main advantages  of the mixed  sward 
are: a DM yield of 20-30%  higher  than in the pure clover sward,  the 
herbage  is easier to ensile, the presence  of a grass companion  reduces 
annual  weeds  and minimizes  the wheel  damage  to clover,  and the herbage 
is better  balanced  nutritionally  than in the pure sward.
Considering  the companion  grass,  Italian  ryegrass  is not recommended  
and the best choice  is a medium-late  perennial  ryegrass  cultivar  such as 
Spirit,  Talbot,  Barlenna,  Combi  and the tetraploids  Taptoe  and Barlatra.
The most appropriate  management  seems to be a first cut in early 
June followed  by two subsequent  cuts in early August  and late September  
respectively.
The D-value  of red clover at the time of the first silage harvest  is 
61-63D.  This low D-value  is acceptable  because  the intake  of red clover 
silage by stock is 20-40 per cent higher  than that of grasses  of the same 
digestibility  (Castle,  1975). Therefore,  silages  with 60-63D  and a high 
protein  content  are considered  of good quality. A 60D digestibility  is 
obtained  in second  and third cuts made with 6-week  regrowth  intervals.
The dry matter  content  of red clover  herbages  is normally  very low 
(12-14%)  and therefore,  they must be wilted to 23-25%.  The use of an 
additive  is essential  and Add-F.  containing  85% formic  acid, has been 
used elfectively  at rates of 2.3-4.5  1/t lifted material.
Regarding  the bloat hazard  it is not important  with red clover  silage  
as it is when the herbage  is grazed  early in the growing  season.  However, 
no bloat problem  was observed  when red clover was grazed by store 
lambs  or cattle from October  to December.  Autumn  grazing  is ideal for 
fattening  store lambs.
Thompson  (1975)  reports  that the oestrogenic  level in red clover  silaae 
is enough  to depress  the reproductive  rate of ewes. Therefore,  ewes should
10
not be fed silage prior to, and during  mating. Braden  et al. (1971)  have 
demonstrated  that cattle metabolize  plant oestrogens  more rapidly  than 
sheep  and thus may have a greater  tolerance  to oestrogenic  effects.
The silage role of the red clover crop is mainly  in arable farming  
systems  where  it makes  an ideal break  crop. Red clover  improves  the soil 
structure  and promotes  the replenishment  of soil N. Spring  barley  after  
a 3-year  tetraploid  red clover  ley yielded  5 t/ha with a N application  
of only 20 kg/ha  (Mackie,  1975).
Lucerne
Little is known  regarding  this legume  in Ireland  although  it has been 
grown  in a very small scale for drying.
This legume  is associated  with low rainfall  areas and with light dry 
soils where summer  drought  frequently  limits yield. It requires  a deep  
well drained  soil with a high pH (6.5-7.0).  Its deep rooting  system  ensures  
the production  of high yields of DM (12 -15 t/ha) in areas affected  by 
drought.  It can also be grown  on heavy soils provided  drainage  is ade­
quate  as it is very intolerant  of wet soil conditions.
A number  of highly  improved  new cultivars  which  are able to persist  
fully productive  for 4-5 years are available  and the best are : Europe,  
Sabilt,  Verneuil  and Vertus. All these cultivars  belong  to the early group  
and provide  three or four cuts per annum.
Europe  outyields  the other cultivars  by 10-15%  in the absence  of 
Verticillium  wilt. The other three cultivars  are resistant  to Verticillium  
wilt but Vertus  has the additional  advantage  of being resistant  to stem 
eelworm.
Cultivar  Europe  is being tested in a field scale experiment  at Johns ­
town Castle,  in pure and mixed swards. The total yields of dry matter  
obtained  from three harvests  in the first growing  season  were 12.8 t/ha 
in pure sward and 10.5 t/ha in mixed sward. This shows that, in con­
trast with red clover,  there is no advantage  in including  a companion  
grass with lucerne.
Lucerne  can be sown from April to the end of July but the April  
sowing  normally  gives a better establishment.  As for red clover  a good 
establishment  can be obtained  with a cereal cover  crop which  will be cut 
for silage in July.
Fertiliser  requirements  of lucerne  are 40 kg of phosphorus  and 200-300  
kg of potassium  per hectare  per annum.
The most suitable  management  for lucerne  is a first harvest  in late 
May followed  by two or three cuts with intervals  of six weeks between  
cuts.
Lucerne  silage is fairly low in digestibility  and at the time of the first 
harvest  has a 60D-value.  However,  its intake by stock is much higher  
than that of grass silages  of the same  digestibility.  A 60D level of digesti ­
bility is obtained  in the subsequent  cuts when  they are made  with 6-week 
regrowth  intervals.  Lucerne  silage has a high crude protein  content  (18- 
20%)  and is rich in minerals.
11
Lucerne  herbages  have a very low sugar content  and this made the 
production  of good  silages  difficult  before  the new improved  silage-making 
techniques  were introduced.  As for red clover the herbage  should be 
wilted for 24-48 hours and an additive  should  be used. The amount  of 
Add-F  for a crop with 20-25%  of DM should  be 3 1/t lifted material.  
There  are no bloat problems  with lucerne  silage.
Conclusions
1. The use of seeds mixtures  based on the ryegrass  cultivars  presently 
available  and specially  tailored  to produce  high yields  of good quality  
silage would reduce  significantly  the deficit  of animal  winter  fodder  
which  exists in Ireland.
2. On many farms in the arable  areas, where  soil conditions  and silage­
making  facilities  are satisfactory,  a greater  use of red clover  is recom ­
mended.
3. An attempt  should  be made  to introduce  lucerne  as a reliable  source  of 
forage in areas with light soils, where poor summer  growth  of the 
grasses  is always  a limiting  factor.

The Relative  Importance  of 
Digestibility,  Ensiling,  Fermentation  
ami Dry Matter  Content  in Limiting  
the Utilisation  of Silage by 
Beef Cattle
A. V. FLYNN  and R. K. WILSON

For reasons  associated  with climate and the mechanisation  of farm  
operations,  ensiling  has become  the first choice  system  of forage  conser ­
vation on most intensive  and modernised  farms. Many problems  have 
been associated  with the ensiling  process  and with silage as a feed for 
ruminants  over the years. The purpose  of this paper is to examine  the 
major factors  which have been associated  with the restriction  of animal  
production  from ensiled  herbage  and examine  the relative  importance  of 
each of them in quantitative  terms  where  possible.  The factors  which  will 
be discussed  are digestibility,  preservation,  dry matter  content,  ensiling  
per se and fine chopping.  While  factors  like secondary  heating  during  the 
feeding  of silage (Zimmer,  1973; Wilkins,  1975) and the non-anaerobic  
storage  of silage (Ruxton  et al, 1975) can have a profound  effect  on silage 
preservation  and consequently  on the efficiency  of animal  production  from 
silage,  their effects  are well understood  and are not discussed  here.
Silage  Digestibility
While it has for long been recognised  that digestibility  of a forage  is 
a factor of major importance  determining  its intake and nutritive  value  
(McCullough,  1961; Balch  and Campling,  1962; McCarrick,  1965; Castle  
and Watson,  1969) higher  digestibility  in a silage has not always  been 
associated  with higher  production  (Tayler  and Aston,  1967) due to inter ­
action  of other factors  (Wilkins,  1974; Wilkins,  1975). Because  of these  
interactions  the relationship  between  dry matter  digestibility  (DMD)  and 
animal  production  has seldom  been described  in quantitative  terms over 
a wide range of digestibility.  In general,  a change  in silage quality  has a 
considerably  greater  effect on the productivity  of beef cattle than on the 
production  of milk in short term experiments  by dairy cows (Waldo,  
1977). Thus it is of interest  to examine  the results  of 40 feeding  experi ­
ments at this station  in which  well preserved  silages  were offered  as the 
sole feed to steers  weighing  400 kg. In most experiments,  pre-experiment  
slaughter  groups  were included  to allow  absolute  measurement  of carcase  
gain. The summary  presented  in Table 1 shows  a clear relationship  be­
tween DMD and animal  performance  in terms of daily liveweight  gain 
and daily carcase  gain. Silages  which  produced  daily liveweight  gains of

less than 0.34 kg/day  had mean DMD  = 60.4% while those which pro­
duced  more than 0.75 kg/day  had DMD  = 74.5%.
In these trials animals  were fed in groups  and mean silage  dry matter  
intakes  were recorded.  There  was a close association  between  daily dry 
matter  intake  and DMD. It ranged  from 1.6% of mean  liveweight  at 60% 
DMD  to over 1.9% at 74% DMD.  This is in contrast  with results  of work 
with sheep  (Wilkins  et al, 1971; Demarquilly,  1973) in which  the digesti ­
bility effect was masked  by variation  in preservation  but is in agreement  
with the results  of an experiment  of Wilkins  and Tetlow  quoted  by Wil­
kins (1974).
It is of interest  to note the magnitude  of the growth  rate of cattle fed 
silages  having  DMD  of 74%. Expressed  either  in terms of liveweight  or 
carcase  gain this is good production  by cattle fed only conserved  grass  
and approaches  the production  (0.57 -0.60 kg carcase/day)  expected  of 
similar  cattle  on grazed  grass  over an entire grazing  season.  The difference  
between  production  from these good silages  and the expected  production  
from grass can be explained  by difference  in feed digestibility.
Similarly  high levels of liveweight  gain on grass silage only have 
occasionally  been reported  (Stewart,  1973; Demarquilly  and Dulphy,  
1976; Mcllmoyle,  1976a'  but other reports  in terms of beef carcase  pro­
duction  are not available.
Silage  Preservation
It is generally  appreciated  that high quality  wet herbage  is difficult  to 
ensile and is predisposed  to clostridial  fermentation.  It is possible  that 
imperfect  preservation  may be responsible  for the infrequent  reports  of 
high production  from silage. Table 2 illustrates  how the quality  of the 
preservation  reduces  the production  potential  of a high quality  silage. In 
this experiment,  the well preserved  silage was treated  with 2.3 I 85% 
formic  acid per tonne  grass at time of ensiling.

value of formic  acid treatment  in ensuring  good preservation  with low 
ammonia  content  in the silage is demonstrated  and the improved  preser ­
vation  is reflected  in animal  production.

^ In vitro DMD results  for only 5 experiments
Various  reports  (Forbes  and Jackson,  1971; Mcllmoyle,  1976b;  Alder,  
McLeod  and Gibbs, 1969; Dulphy  and Demarquilly,  1977) indicate  that 
the effect of imperfect  preservation  on silage nutritive  value is reduced  
when supplementary  energy  is offered  with the silage. The effect is not 
completely  eliminated,  however.  Furthermore,  imperfect  preservation  
results  in reduced  efficiency  of conservation  of stored  dry matter  (Kauf-  
mann  and Zimmer,  1969; Waldo  et al, 1971) and in reduced  digestibility  
of dry matter  fed out of storage  (Waldo  et al, i971; Castle  and Watson,  
1970a). Thus for several  reasons,  the necessity  for perfect  preservation  
in the silo is demonstrated.
In farm practice,  silage  preservation  can be influenced  by grass species, 
content  of fermentable  carbohydrate  and by ensilage  techniques.  Jones  
(1970)  found that ryegrass  (LoUum  perenne)  was easier  to ensilage  than
17
cocksfoot  {Dactylis  glomerata)  or timothy  {Phleum  pratense).  We have 
confirmed  this in many  laboratory  experiments.
The water soluble  carbohydrate  (WSC)  content  of the grass at time 
of ensiling  is a major  determinant  of the course  of silage  fermentation  in 
the absence  of effective  additive  treatment.  While fermentable  carbohy ­
drate levels as low as 6 to 8% of the dry matter  have been suggested  as 
adequate  (Smith,  1962), it appears  from a survey  of 800 silages,  mainly 
abstracted  from published  results,  that a WSC content  equivalent  to 3% 
in the solution ensiled  is required  to give a 95% chance  of the silage  being  
well preserved  without  additive  treatments  (Wilson  and Flynn,  unpub ­
lished data). This 3% WSC solution  corresponds  to an average  14% 
WSC  in the dry matter  of samples  in this survey.
Delayed  sealing  has a detrimental  effect  on silage  preservation  (Hen ­
derson  and McDonald,  1975) and has a considerable  modifying  influence  
on the minimum  WSC  content  required  to ensure  good preservation  (Wil­
son, unpublished  results).
The absence  of a quick test which may be applied  in the field to 
reliably  estimate  the WSC content  of the herbage  being ensiled  means 
that farmers  must adopt a policy  of using formic  acid or other effective  
additive  on all high quality  herbage  ensiled  without  wilting.
Another  problem  often associated  with wet silages is low nitrogen  
retention.  While most studies  as reviewed  by Wilkins  (1974)  record  low 
nitrogen  retention  on wet silages,  it is of interest  to note that Waldo  et al 
(1969)  and Waldo  et al (1971)  and Waldo  et al (1973)  found acceptably  
good nitrogen  retention  on wet silage in which ammonia  nitrogen  was 
less than 10% of total nitrogen  in contrast  with low nitrogen  retention  
on poorly  conserved  silage  with 14% of total N as ammonia.  Low nitro ­
gen retention  may well be a specific  characteristic  of poorly preserved  
silage  rather  than a characteristic  of wet silages  in general.
Silage preservation  is commonly  accepted  as being good if less than 
14% of the nitrogen  is present  as ammonia.  It appears  from the results 
of nitrogen  retention  studies  and animal  production  studies  that a silage  
described  as being  well preserved  should  have less than 10% of its nitro ­
gen present  as ammonia.
Silage  dry matter  content
Raising  the dry matter  content  of herbage  before  ensiling  has for long 
been recognised  as a means  of ensuring  good preservation  in the silo and 
is very often regarded  as essential  in order to produce  silage with a high 
nutritive  value. Reports  of experiments  comparing  forages  of different 
dry matter  content  usually  attribute  any differences  found  to the difference  
in dry matter  content  even though  in many instances  the preservation  of 
the wetter  forage  might  have been quite imperfect  by any standard.  That  
is to say that differences  have been attributed  to dry matter  content  which  
could logically  have been attributed  to preservation.
Table 4 is a summary  of reports  comparing  forages  differing  in dry 
matter  content.

They have been arbitarily  segregated  into 2 groups depending  on 
whether  the direct  cut unwilted  silage was poorly  preserved  or well pre­
served  as indicated  by ammonia  (% total N) and/or  pH. The response  
to wilting  in terms of dry matter  intake  and animal  production  is given 
as the difference  between  unwilted  and wilted  expressed  as a percent  of 
the unwilted.  This allows  the results  of experiments  with dairy cows and 
with growing  cattle  to be summarised  in one table. As expected,  there is 
a considerable  response  to wilting  in both dry matter  intake  and animal  
production  when  wilted  silage  is compared  with poorly  preserved  unwilted  
silage. It is of considerable  interest  to note that despite  an apparent  in­
crease in dry matter  intake  due to wilting,  a production  response  is not 
normally  recorded  when wilted silage is compared  with well preserved  
unwilted  silage. Efficiency  of conversion  of forage  dry matter  to product  
appears  to be reduced  by wilting  when  wilted  silage  is compared  with well 
preserved  unwilted  silage. The mean reduction  in experiments  reviewed 
in Table  4 was 10.8%. This aspect  of forage  dry matter  content  has been  
ignored  in most reports  though  it has been noted  and discussed  by some 
(Waldo  et al, 1969; Presthegge,  1959). It indicates  that more highly  fer­
mented  and/or  wetter  silage might utilised  more efficiently  than the 
less fermented  drier forage.
There  have been several  comparisons  of unwilted  and wilted  silage  for 
beef cattle at our Institute.  The results  of 3 experiments  are summarized  
in Table  5.

In general,  dry matter  intake has been higher  for the wilted silage.  
This difference  has not, however,  been reflected  in carcase  gain. In 
another  experiment  (Flynn,  1974), wilting  increased  liveweight  gain but 
did not raise carcase  weight. The discrepancy  between  liveweight  gain 
and carcase  gain in comparisons  of forages  of different  dry matter  con­
tent has been noted before and has been shown to be attributable  to 
differences  in rumen  contents  (McCarrick,  1967). Again  there is the sug­
gestion  that the wilted  dry matter  is utilised  less efficiently  than the un­
wilted  dry matter.
• Since Ekern  and Reid (1963)  showed  more efficient  utilisation  of the 
dry matter  in a highly fermented  forage there have been basic studies 
reviewed  by Wilkins  (1974)  and Waldo  (1977)  indicating  similar  efficiency  
of utilisation  of energy  in wet and dry forages.  These  results  are in con­
flict with the apparently  better utilisation  of wet silage in feeding  trials  
but this may arise out of the fact that silage dry matter  intake is often  
a biased  estimate  of energy  intake (Waldo,  1977). It must, however,  be 
of some relevence  to note that in a comparison  of hay and silage the 
carcases  of silage  fed cattle were at least as heavy  as, and contained  more 
fat than, carcases  of hay fed cattle (McCarrick,  1967). There is a clear  
implication  in these results  that the silage  energy  is utilised  more efficiently  
than the energy  in the dry forage. This aspect  of forage  conservation  has 
to date received  too little research  attention.
The results  of a recent  experiment  (Flynn,  1976) comparing  the feed­
ing value of wilted silage (50% dry matter)  and hay for beef heifers  are 
summarised  in Table  6. Carcase  production  on the  two feeds  were similar  
but again there was a difference  in carcase  fat content  in favour  of the 
wetter,  fermented  forage. These  results  require  an explanation.

Whether  the explanation  might  be found  in the proportions  of volatile 
fatty acids (VFA ’s) in the rumen  is not clear. While  the volume  of litera ­
ture on rumen VFA ’s and their nutritional  significance  is large, very 
little of it deals specifically  with the effect of conservation  system on 
rumen  VFA pattern. What evidence  there is in this area is conflicting.  
While  some reports  indicate  lower acetic/higher  propionic  concentration  
on wetter and more highly fermented  forages  than on drier forages 
(Ekem  and Reid, 1963; Hawkins  et al, 1970; Rohr et al, 1974; Schaadt  
and Johnson,  1969; Dash et al, 1974) others have found the opposite  
(Zelter,  1969; Donaldson  and Edwards,  1976). In the experiment  referred 
to in Table 6 the rumen  VFA ’s were determined  on samples  of rumen
20
liquor  taken soon after slaughter  (Wilson  and Flynn, 1976). Acetic/pro-  
pionic  ratio was 3.5 for the wilted  silage compared  with 4.0 for the hay. 
While the difference  is small it is in the direction  which is regarded  as 
favouring  more efficient  production  by meat animals  (Ekern  and Reid,  
1963; Weiss et al, 1967) and is similar  in magnitude  to a difference  be­
tween grass and silage reported  by Donaldson  and Edwards  (1976) as 
being  large enough  to be of nutritional  significance.
Effect  of ensiling
While it is accepted  that efficient  ensiling  has little adverse  effect on 
herbage  digestibility  (Harris  and Raymond,  1963; Demarquilly,  1973) it 
is generally  accepted  that ensiling  reduces  the nutritive  value of herbage  
through  reduction  of voluntary  intake. Reduced  intake  of silage relative  
to the grass from which the silage was made has been demonstrated  
(Demarquilly  and Jarrige,  1970; Donaldson  and Edwards,  1976; Lancas ­
ter, 1975; Bryant  and Lancaster,  1970; Harris  and Raymond,  1963) but 
others working  with corn silage containing  very low levels of ammonia  
have found little difference  between  fresh and ensiled  material  (Bergen 
et al. 1974; Dinius  et al. 1968; Wilkinson  et al, 1976). Donaldson  and 
Edwards  (1976)  using sheep found that wilting  the grass and ensiling  it 
with formic  acid raised silage intake  to the level achieved  on the grass. 
Most of the experiments  quoted  here were conducted  with sheep. In 
general  the intakes  of silages  by caged sheep tend to be rather  low and 
one must question  whether  the results  of many silage experiments  con­
ducted  with sheep  are really  relevant  to cattle.
Flynn (1976) using 350 kg cattle found little reduction  in intake of 
grass silage  made with formic  acid relative  to intake  of fresh grass.
Results  of B. Michalet  (quoted  by Demarquilly  and Dulphy,  1976)  
showed  reduced  dry matter  intake  of fine chopped  herbage  by sheep  due 
to ensiling  but no reduction  in intake  by heifers. Flynn  (1977)  compared  
fresh grass and silage made with formic  acid in a 106 day experiment  
using 430 kg steers. All silages  were well preserved.  Animal  production  
results  are summarised  in Table  7.

While daily liveweight  gains differed  between  the feeds dry matter  
intake  and daily carcase  gain were very similar.  Incidentally,  these results 
show once again how misleading  it can be to assess  treatment  effect on 
beef production  in terms of liveweight  change  only. The experiment  was 
conducted  to quantify  the silage intake problem  and its effect on beef 
production.  This result,  when viewed  along  with the high levels of pro­
duction  achieved  with the highly  digestible  silages  in Table 1, questions  
the existence  of the problem  for beef cattle fed on well preserved  silage.
It is becoming  apparent  that an ensiling  fermentation  in which am­
monia  production  is restricted  will not reduce  the nutritive  value of her­
bage and will not present  a feed intake  problem  of practical  importance  
for beef cattle.
Fine chopping
Several reports have appeared  recently  showing  an effect of fine 
chopping  and comminution  on intake of silage by sheep and cattle.  
Dulphy  and Demarquilly  (1973) and Demarquilly  and Dulphy  (1976)  
using sheep found a variable  intake  response  to fine chopping.  Where 
responses  were large,  the effect  of chopping  was confounded  with a silage  
preservation  effect and the increase  tended  to be due more to very low 
intake  on long silage than to elevated  intake  on the finely  chopped  silage  
(Dulphy  et al, 1975). Likewise,  Deswysen  (1978) found an Increase  in 
intake  by sheep  due to fine chopping  of silage  just before  feeding.  Demar ­
quilly  and Dulphy  (1976)  quote results  of B. Michalet  which  show a con­
siderable  response  to fine chopping  by heifers. These results  also show  
that differences  observed  with sheep  may be much  greater  than differences  
observed  with cattle on the same feeds and illustrate  again  the danger  of 
applying  the results of sheep experiments  to cattle. Demarquilly  and 
Dulphy  (1975)  showed  a response  in terms  of intake  and milk production  
by cows to fine chopping  but the efficiency  with which  feed was converted  
to milk did not seem to be improved.  Better  (1978)  increased  intake  of 
cows progressively  by chopping  to 17 mm or 9 mm compared  with 72 
mm long silage. Chopping  stemmy  forage  through  a harvesting  machine  
set to a theoretical  chop length  of 17 mm did not increase  dry matter  in­
take of steers  whereas  chopping  of 6 mm theoretical  chop length  increased  
dry matter  intake  by 15% (Flynn,  1977). Mincing  or pulping  forage  has 
been shown  to increase  intake  (Thomas  et al, 1976; Greenhalgh  and Reid,  
1975) and production  by cattle  (Houseman  et al, 1975).
It appears  that this area of silage  research  is worthy  of more investiga ­
tion but care must  be taken  to separate  the effects  of chopping  and preser ­
vation. Perhaps  we should  expect  that the effect  of fine chopping  of silage  
should  be analogous  to the effect  of processing  dry forage  as summarised  
by Beardsley  (1964).  We should  look on fine chopping  of silage  as a means  
to increase  its nutritive  value relative  to that of the parent  herbage  rather  
than as a process  necessary  to maintain  in silage the nutritive  value of 
the parent  herbage.

Summary
High levels  of production  by beef catle are achievable  on grass silage 
if digestibility  is high and preservation  is very good. While silage dry 
matter content can influence  preservation  and through  preservation,  
influence  intake and animal  production,  low dry matter  content  per se 
is not a major  constraint  to the productivity  of wet silage. Utilisation  of 
the dry matter  in drier and less fermented  forages  often appears  lower 
than that in wetter  and more highly  fermented  silages.  Our rather  limited  
knowledge  of the influence  of conservation  system  on rumen  fermentation  
could be a constraint  in this area. The specific  effect of ensiling  by the 
best available  techniques  on the energy  intake and nutritive  value of a 
forage needs to be firmly established.  Failure  in the past to define the 
magnitude  of silage intake problem  for cattle has possibly  been a con­
straint  to clear thinking  in the whole area of forage conservation.  We 
should  not see degree  of chopping  as a constraint  to the achievement  of 
high production  from silage but rather  as a process  to increase  the nutri ­
tive value of feed above that of the fresh parent  herbage.  In these last 
two areas there is need for more work with cattle and cows as there is a 
danger  that results  obtained  with sheep  may apply  only to sheep.

The Interaction  of Harvesting  Machinery  
and Silage  Quality
P. COMERFORD
The Agricultural Institute,  Oakpark,  Carlow.
The importance  of high quality  silage in beef or dairy production  cannot  
be over-emphasised.  This is especially  true when we consider  the high 
costs of alternative  feeds. There is an increasing  awareness  throughout  
the country  of this need but for one reason  or another  many farmers  are 
finding  it difficult  to attain their targets. There are many factors  associ ­
ated with producing  a high quality  silage  but the one which  predominates  
is the stage of cutting.  Grass which  has been fertilized  and closed  up from 
early spring  must be cut before  June 1 if the high quality  obtainable  from 
such forage  is to be preserved.  Since over 60% of all silage  made  in the 
country  is harvested  by contractors  many quality-conscious  farmers  will 
be relying  on these contractors  to complete  work on time. As more  
farmers  change  to early  cutting  it is inevitable  that a peak demand  period  
will occur in the early stages of the season. Contractors  will therefore  
not be able to cope with all the work on hands. Already  the problem  is 
acute in some areas and farmers  must wait up to three weeks  for a con­
tractor. How can this problem  be avoided  ? A number  of solutions  are 
possible.
1. By selecting  grass strains which reach maximum  digestibility  at a 
later stage than usual or strains  which retain  their peak digestibility  
for a longer  period. Such grasses  are available  and it has been shown 
that their quality  will not deteriorate  to any extent  until the latter  part 
of June. Their use should  give the farmer  more scope to obtain a 
contractor  while herbage  quality  is still high.
By adopting  a multi-cut  system  the quantities  of grass for harvesting  
in the early cut will be reduced  and the work-load  will be spread  
more evenly  over the summer  months.  This would  suit the contractors  
since mid-summer  work is usually  slack. The current  method  usually  
applied by contractors  of charging  by the acre militates  strongly  
against  the multi-cut  system  and an hourly  or all-in charge  is a more  
satisfactory  method.  In addition,  the full impact  of the multi-cut  sys­
tem can only be felt if a high proportion  of farmers  opt for the 
method.  It would  seem that this solution  will be slow in alleviating  
a problem  which  is already  acute.
3. Increase  contractor  capacity.  This is a solution  which  has only very 
limited  application  since  contractors would  be unwise  to invest  heavily  
in equipment  which  would  only be used for a short period. Should  a 
contractor  increase  his harvesting  capacity  to cater for the early rush 
he may be forced  to charge  more than normal  for this service  to com­
pensate  for the short working  season.
272.
4. The one sure way of overcoming  the early harvesting  problem  is for 
all those farmers  who cannot  get their work completed  on time by 
contract  to purchase  their own equipment.  While  this is not possible  
in every instance  there are many farmers  and groups  of farmers  who 
should  have their own equipment.  They would benefit  considerably.  
In making  the choice  as to whether  or not one should  have his own 
equipment  the following  points  should  be considered  :
(a) The ability to own and operate  machinery  : many farmers  have 
neither  the ability  nor the inclination  to own and operate  their own 
silage-making  equipment.  Such people  are best advised  to seek one 
of the other alternatives  or to offer inducements  to contractors  to 
commence  harvesting  on a pre-arranged  date.
(b) Can the silage making  routine be fitted into the existing  farming  
routine?  This question  must be carefully  considered.  If other equally  
important  work must be delayed  or omitted,  the advantages  can be 
eroded. If silage-making  coincides  with other important  work the 
speed of operation  is reduced  below acceptable  levels. It has been 
suggested  that the minimum  target should be 60 tonnes of silage  
harvested  per day. If harvesting  does not commence  until mid­
morning  and must finish early, it may be difficult  to achieve  this 
target with the machines  available.  In any event slow harvesting  
makes  it impossible  to ensile all the crop when the quality  is highest.
(c) Is ownership  of silage machinery  economically  feasible  ? In costing 
an operation  such as this it is usual to consider  what equipment  
already  exists and to assume  that it will be available  at operating  
costs plus repairs  only. Equipment  specially  purchased  for the work 
must of course  be fully costed  to the operation.  The total cost of the 
work is divided  by the acreage  harvested  and a cost j^r acre calcu ­
lated. The cost thus obtained  can be compared  with alternative  
methods  and if all things are equal the cheapest  harvesting  method  
can be employed.  For most small harvesting  systems  the break-down  
point with normal  contractor  charges  is between  50 and 120 acres.  
This does not take into consideration  the extra  cash benefits  accruing  
from a better  quality  silage as a result of early harvesting.  A recent  
study reported  in Great Britain**'  suggests  that when this is added,  
the break-even  points  can be halved.
Further  consideration  will be given to operating  costs and break-even  
points  in the following  paragraphs.
Forage  harvesting  systems  for private  ownership
There  are many  harvesting  systems  suitable  for farmer  ownership  and 
the five most popular  ones are presented  in Table 1. It shows  that the 
side mounted  single chop with a cutting  width of 50 inches  can harvest  
between  ^ and 1 acre per hour and can break-even  with a contractor  at 
50 acres harvesting  per year. At the other end of the scale the trailed  
precision  chop has a much higher  output  but would  need to harvest  over 
125 acres per year to justify  itself. If, of course,  an alternative  harvesting

improved  quality  silage.
Table 2 attempts  to summarise  the main attributes  of the different  
harvesting  systems  using a scoring  system  of 0 - 5 for the various  head ­
ings. By combining  the information  contained  in Tables  1 and 2 it should  
be possible  to identify  the system  most suitable  for many  cases.

The pick-up  wagon
The pick-up  wagon forage harvesting  system is comparatively  new 
and merits  some additional  consideration.  The system  consists  of a pick­
up wagon,  three tractors,  a mower  and a buckrake.  Frequently  the third  
tractor  is omitted  and the same tractor  operates the mower  and buckrake.  
Most  pick-up wagons  have the ability  to take a grass  swath  off the ground
29
at a rate exceeding  two acres per hour. However,  since the wagon  must 
also transport  its load to the silo it is off the field for some of the time 
and the overall  harvesting  rate is much slower  than the picking  up rate 
(Table  1). This is one of the basic drawbacks  of the system. Farms  on 
which  the distance  between  the silo and the field exceeds  800-1000  yards  
are not suitable  to the wagon  system  unless  the machine  is large or the 
access  roads  exceedingly  good.
The power  required  by the wagon  is less than 50 hp but it is recom ­
mended  that at least a 60 hp tractor  be used with the larger  machines  to 
tow full wagons  up steep inclines  and as an insurance  against  instability  
when transporting.  Because  of their low power  requirement  wagon  sys­
tems need about  30% less fuel than a flail forage  harvesting  system  with 
the same output.  Since  crops  have to be pre-cut  for the wagon  the system  
lends itself to wilting.
Because  of the high cost of the wagon  and rotary  mower  the system  
has a high initial outlay but the running  costs are low because  of the 
small amount  of men and machines  involved.  Table 3 gives a summary  
of operating  costs for 50 to 100 hours  annual  use for a 5 and 7 year life 
span.

90 23.50 20.00
100 21.20 18.10
In using  a pick-up  wagon  for the first time a number  of points  require
special  attention  to ensure that the silage isproperly  made. Since the
wagon  only chops the grass coarsely  (some machines  have extra knives  
which  can chop to a theoretical  length  of 1^") and does no laceration,  the 
forage  can be very spongy  especially  when wilted. In order that over­
heating  does not occur  the forage  should  be well rolled during  ensiling.  
When the pits are full they should be covered  immediately  with two 
layers  of 500g polythene  and the edges thoroughly  sealed.
Group  ownership
Most of the systems  already  described  are economically  justifiable  
when the acreage  harvested  is in excess  of 70 acres. There  is however  no 
reason  why two farmers  with half the acreage  should not combine  to 
purchase  and operate  the equipment  between  them and reap the same  
benefits. The concept  of partnership  or group ownershirp  is not new
30
although  very few groups  have been organised  according  to any recog ­
nized set of rules. Loose partnerships  or instances  where a machine  is 
purchased  between  groups  of farmers  and passed  from one to the other  
have a very slender  chance  of surviving  unless  the partners  have very 
clear understandings.  It has been shown both in this country  and in 
England  that where the partnership  is established  according  to well 
recognised  procedure  with clearly  defined  rules to cater for every even ­
tuality,  the arrangements  work very satisfactorily.  Some properly-run  
groups  are in existence  for many years and have continued  to expand  
their joint commitments.
Apart from the advantages  of private  ownership  already  mentioned,  
small farmers  in partnership  also have the advantage  of a pooled  labour  
force on the few occasions  of the year when thy need them. If the in­
grained  opposition  exhibited  to the concept  of group  ownership  could be 
overcome  there is no reason why this pooling  of resources  could not 
contribute  substantially  to farming  progress  in the future.  Indeed,  smaller  
farmers  may have very little alternative  in the future if they are to 
continue  to compete  successfully  with their larger  neighbours.
Wilting
Much of the grass harvested  in this country  as wilted  silage does not 
qualify  for such a description.  In most cases grass which  is cut one day 
and picked  up the following  day without  any intermediate  treatment  will 
not have wilted sufficiently  especially  if the crop is young and heavy. 
Crops cut in May are particularly  difficult  to wilt because  dews are 
usually  heavy  and drying  is slow. Wilting  in inclement  weather  requires  
a particularly  dedicated  approach.  In many  European  countries  where  a 
wilt to 40-45%  is normal  the early  cut crops  are frequently  on the ground  
for 3-4 days and receive  about 4 teddings  or other treatments.  Under  
Irish conditions  where a wilt to 25-30%  would be more common  the 
early cut crop would  have to be on the ground  for two days and receive 
two teddings.  At least one of these teddings  could be eliminated  by the 
use of a mower/conditioner.  This is a mower  with a special  attachment  
which bruises  or lacerates  the crop during  cutting  and deposits  it in a 
fluffy loose stage on the ground.  Such swaths  dry faster than untreated  
ones. Flail mowers  also can be used and subsequent  drying  is very fast 
provided  weather  conditions  are suitable.  Using a flail mower  in wet 
conditions  can result in higher  than average  dry matter  losses.
Feeding  silage
The practice  of cutting  the silage from the clamp  and trough  feeding  
it to the animals  is becoming  increasingly  popular.  A number  of systems 
are available  for removing  the silage and their selection  depends  on the 
feeding  lay-out  and the number  of animals  to be fed. Figure 1 shows 
how the common  systems  compare  on costs and output  for various  num ­
bers of animals.  While  these figures  would  indicate  that the front loader,  
especially  with an hydraulic  tipping  and grab attachment  is the most  
economical  and fastest  system  for units up to 400 animals  it is not suit-

able where the silo is a distance  from the animals.  This is particularly  
true for larger  units where  the feeder  box is much  more suitable.
Although  the block  cutter system  was not covered  in the above study  
later measurements  indicate  that it has an average  feeding  rate of about  
0.5 minutes  per animal  for transport  distances  of up to 50 metres. The 
main advantage  of the block feeder  is the almost  total absence  of waste 
at the silo. In fact over a week ’s supply  of blocks  can be removed  at the 
same time without  any deterioration  of the exposed  silage surface.  Some 
buildings,  however,  do not suit block  feeders  and even in the best lay-outs  
some hand forking  is almost  Inevitable.  This however  should  not deter  
the owners  of houses  with wide centre  passages  or peripheral  feeding  from  
stacking  the blocks  just outside  the reach  of the animals  and giving  them  
their daily ration  by hand,  off the top of the blocks.
Other  systems  using more elaborate  silage cutting,  transportation  and 
feeding  arrangements  are also available.  These  have not become  popular  
mainly  because  of their price and a high degree  of specialization.

Is there a Place for Irrigation  on 
Dairy Farms?
A. J. BRERETON
Agricultural  Institute,  Johnstown  Castle,  Wexford.
The drought  years 1975 and 1976 have raised  the question  of whether  or 
not there is a place for irrigation  in Ireland.  Even without  the extreme  
drought  of those two years, given time, the question  would have arisen  
as our systems  of land-use  became  more and more intensive.
There is no doubt that in every year all parts of this country  suffer  
from drought —we have drought  in summer  whenever  we have more than 
ten consecutive  days without  rain. This paper gives our best estimates  
of the yield losses in grassland  caused  by these droughts  and indicates  
how the value of these losses  relates  to the cost of irrigation.
The response  to water was measured  at two sites in Co. Wexford — 
one site was on a coarse  sandy-textured  brown  podzol  (light Screen  soil),  
the other on a loam-textured  podzolic  gley (heavy  Rathangan  soil)—in 
1973, 1974 and 1975 (Table 1). Summer  rainfall  was 509, 465 and 295 
mm (Apr-Sep  inc) in 1973, 1974 and 1975 respectively,  so that results  
were obtained  in both wet and dry years. At each site in each year a total 
of 260 N kg/ha/annum  was used in three applications  (110, 70 and 60 
N kg/ha  in March  and after each cut. Also 40 P kg/ha  and 50 K kg/ha  
were applied  in March,  and 50 K kg/ha  after the first cut. In 1974 and 
1975 the nitrogen  rate was increased  to 400 N kg/ha  to ensure  that any 
losses by leaching  would not affect yields (this was a safety precaution  
for experimental  purposes  only). Water was applied  to the plots twice 
each week at a rate which varied with rainfall  but which ensured  that 
irrigation  and rain equalled  3.3 mm/day  since the last application.  The 
greatest  response  was obtained  in the driest  year (1975),  the least response  
in the wettest  year (1973)  (Table  2).

These results  only indicate  that grass yield in Wexford  is normally  
restricted  by water storage  and that restrictions  can be as great as 4 
tonnes/ha/annum.  In order  to obtain  a more  general  picture  for the whole  
country  over a long pieriod  of years,  predictions  of yield restrictions  using  
meteorological  records  were estimated.
The meteorological  records  for Johnstown  Castle  for years 1973, 1974 
and 1975 were used to calculate  the expected  loss of yield due to drought  
in those years,  and these calculated  values  were compared  with the losses  
found by experimentation  in those years. This comparison  was made in 
order to check that the method  of prediction  was reliable. Calculated  
annual  yield losses  are shown  in Table  3.

The predictions  were well correlated  with the measured  responses  but 
the predictions  tended  to overestimate  the response.  On the basis of this 
trend all subsequent  predictions  were corrected  accordingly.
From the meteorological  records  for selected  sites potential  annual  
yield and average  yield loss due to water shortage  were estimated  (Table  
4).
The results indicate  that the yield loss due to drought  is about 1 
tonne/ha  inland for the country  as a whole with responses  tending  to 
increase  towards  the south east. Coastal  areas generally  show a higher 
response  especially  on the south  and east coasts.
In a Dutch survey  of European  irrigation,  this country  is shown  to 
have an average  annual  maximum  water deficit  less than 25 mm in the 
west and between  25 and 50 mm in the east (Table  5).

Thus,  an average  annual  response  to water  of about 1.5 tonnes  in the 
south  east, and less than 1.0 tonnes  in the west is expected,  and in the east 
this average  is exceeded  in more  than five years  of each 10 years.
There  was no consistent  difference  in response  between  the light and 
heavy  soils. Differences  in root distribution  could  account  for this. Table  
6 shows  that if the mairt body of roots at Rathangan  were in the top 10 
cm of the profile,  then starting  at field capacity,  30.2 mm of water  would 
be available.  This is equivalent  to about 10 days ’ water loss by evapo- 
transpiration  in summer. At Screen,  the same amount  of water  would  be 
available  if the main body of roots were in the top 15 cm of the profile  
(i.e. the roots at Screen  would need to be only two inches deeper). It 
would  appear  from these data that soil type may be less important  than 
rainfall  in determining  irrigation  need for normal  soils. In shallow  soils,  
available  water  may be restricted  by soil depth.

Irrigation  systems
Agricultural  irrigation  systems  are generally  mobile  so that only part 
of the area is irrigated  on each day. Commonly,  the interval  between 
irrigation  in each part of the area is 10 days. Evaporation  in summer  is 
about 2-3 mm per day so that after a 10-day  period without  rain it is 
necessary  to apply  about  25 mm of water.  Irrigation  systems  are designed 
to deliver  this rate in a day’s working.  On heavier  soils the infiltration  
rate of water  is about  5 mm/hr;  on light soils it is about  20 mm/hr,  thus,  
even on heavy  soils it is possible  to apply  40 mm in an 8-hour  day without  
flooding.  A 10-day irrigation  cycle is used because  in this part of the 
world,  with evaporation  rates of about 2.5 mm/day,  the deficit  after 10 
days is about  25 mm (one inch). It is generally  agreed  that, with a deficit 
between  zero and 30 mm, plant growth  is little affected.  But above this 
deficit  growth  begins  to be seriously  affected.  At 120 mm growth  ceases.
The conventional  rotary sprinkler  on lateral pipes, moved by hand  
along  a fixed main supply  line, is relatively  cheap,  but has a high labour  
requirement.  It is more appropriate  for small horticultural  systems.
The modern  mobile  irrigation  systems  are designed  for larger  acreages 
with reduced  labour  inputs. They require  larger  pumps  and make  greater  
demands  on water  supply;  they also cost more. The systems  vary widely 
in design  and cost (Table  7).

The capital  cost per hectare  increases  with the size of the system 
(Fig. 1). The annual  cost/ha  for running  and maintenance  decreases  as 
the size of the system  increases  (Table  8). These  costs are based  on 1976 
data for the United  Kingdom.  We have assumed  that all costs are the 
same in Ireland  except  for the charge  for abstraction  of water from the 
mains.  In Britain  this cost is 4.2 p/4.5 m* for direct  abstraction  m summer  
and 1 p/4.5 m’ for abstraction  in winter  for reservoir  storage.  In Ireland  
the water  charge  is 25p for 4.5 ml Hence  the cost of water  is a major  item 
in the annual  Wll in Ireland.

The volumes  of water involved  in irrigation  are large. In an average  
season six million  gallons  would be required.  This is equivalent  to a 
stored  volume  of 1 ha x 2.5 m deep.
If we calculate  the value of grass dry matter  as its Barley  equivalent,  
then the grass dry matter  response  required  to justify  various  levels of 
cost may be summarised  as follows :

At these cost levels it is clear that irrigation  is only likely to be pro­
fitable  in the south  east and then only when a good private  water  supply  
is available.  In the east and south coastal  areas of high response  even the 
most costly  system  could be justified.

Calf Housing —Design  Considerations  
when Planning  Housing  for 
Home  Reared  and Bought  In Calves
C. D. MITCHELL
The Scottish  Farm  Buildings Investigation  Unit, Craibstone,  
Bucksburn,  Aberdeen.
The major  objective  in the design  and planning  of calf housing  is to pro­
vide an environment  which will encourage  the production  of healthv  
calves.  ■’
In this paper a brief outline  of calf housing  work carried  out at the 
Scottish  Farm Buildings  Investigation  Unit (SFBIU)  will be followed  by 
two commercial  examples  of calf houses  designed  on the basis of the 
results  of the experimental  studies.
General  requirements
Calf housing  should  provide  a suitable  environment  both climatic  and 
structural  for the calf and the stockman.  It should  also provide  ample  
space for husbandry  and management  tasks and should be planned  in 
detail to achieve  these objectives  at the lowest  possible  capital  and with a 
low labour  requirement.
Commencing  in 1968, at the SFBIU,  the feasibility  of naturally  venti ­
lated uninsulated  calf housing,  termed  climatic  housing,  was examined  for 
rearing  calves  from approximately  one to twelve  weeks  of age throughout  
the year. From the experiments  it was established  that climatic  housing  
With good calf husbandry  and an adequate  plane  of calf nutrition  provides  
a very acceptable  low cost alternative  to tbe previously  common  fan ven­
tilated  insulated  and often  heated  calf housing.
The main advantages  of naturally  ventilated  calf housing  are •
1. reduced  capital  cost;
2. low running  costs (no fans, heaters  or controls);
3. immunity  from failure  of electric  power;
4. correct  design a reduced  management  requirement  as no adjustments  
need be made  to the ventilation  system  throughout  the year.
Studies  were also made on the design  of natural  ventilation  systems.
hese enabled  design  data to be produced  which  will ensure  a minimum  
ventilation  rate of 20 cubic feet per minute  per calf, with a minimum  
cubic air capacity  of 200 cubic feet per calf in calf houses  with different 
cross sections  to the original  experimental  unit.
The results  provided  a design  basis for naturally  ventilated  calf hous ­
ing and buildings  were designed  and costed  against  a fan ventilated  in­
sulated  calf house. The costings  showed  that naturally  ventilated  calf 
housing  reduces  the capital  cost of calf housing  when compared  with fan 
ventilated  insulated  calf houses.
43
Overall,  naturally  ventilated  calf housing  was established  as suitable  
for calf rearing  and acceptable  both environmentally  and economically  
as an alternative  to the fan ventilated  insulated  type of calf house (Mit­
chell, 1975).
Throughout  the work the calf was considered  as the designers  client  
and an understanding  of its requirements  was put as a primary  objective. 
In the past there  had been a tendency  for package  deal manufacturers  and 
farm buildings  designers  to use a similar  structure  for poultry,  pigs and 
calves  without  first ensuring  that it was suitable  for calves. Each class of 
livestock  requires  different  environmental  conditions.
With the calf, a designer  is basically  aiming  to provide : (1) a dry bed; 
(2) a well ventilated  calf house;  (3) a draught  free environment  during  the 
winter  months.
1. A dry bed is provided  by attention  to floor  drainage  beneath  straw  
bedding  and a minimum  floor slope of 1 in 20 is required.  The bedding  
will not move down  this slope. The effects  of flooring  type on calculated  
critical  temperatures  for a 50 kg calf in calm air on full feed are given in 
Table 1.

Calf lying on wooden  slats -10
Calf lying on dry concrete + 2
Calf standing -10
* It is important  to remember  that the lower the critical temperature,  the 
better the calf is able to resist cold stress
It is often necessary  to have close site supervision  during  construction  
to ensure adequate  floor slopes and good internal  layout of drainage.  
Water bowls, automatic  feeders  or feed buckets  must be placed  at the 
lower  end of the sloped  floors  to ensure  that bedding  remains  dry.
2. Well ventilated  calf house. In a naturally  ventilated  calf house 
the minimum  ventilation  rate is calculated  on the basis of the stack effect  
and the maximum  rate on the wind effect. Ventilation  should  be designed 
to provide  specific  rates. It is a precise  science  and not ‘a hole, a hole 
and a hope that it will work ’. Design  data given at the end of this paper  
will ensure  an adequate  minimum  ventilation  rate per calf. Ventilation  
should  be designed  to remove  moisture  vapour  produced,  disease  organ ­
isms,  dust and foul air, and replace  them with fresh air. Ventilation  should  
also remove  by-products  such as ammonia,  hydrogen  sulphide,  carbon  
dioxide  and methane.
44
3. A draught  free environment  during  the winter  months. Draught  
free conditions  at calf level are achieved  by attention  to internal  details  
and studies  of internal  airflow  patterns. At the SFBIU  we are fortunate  
in having  both a water  table and a wind tunnel  for ventilation  studies.
Model  study  airflow  in two calf houses  (Mitchell  and Ross 1977)
Model studies  were carried  out to examine  the effect of pen covers 
together  with solid and open pen fronts on the air flow patterns  in two 
naturally  ventilated  calf houses. One calf house was a model of the 
SFBIU  experimental  climatic  calf house with two rows of pens and a 
central  passage.  Pen covers  were first used over the rear of the pens in 
1968 and continued  in use throughout  the work. The other  had four rows 
with two passages  and was a typical  four-row  naturally  ventilated  calf 
house. In both buildings  air inlets were below  eaves level and air outlets  
were open ridges.
The flow patterns  were based on flow in the plane of a cross section 
from right to left. This flow represented  the wind effect component  of 
natural  ventilation.  The stack effect was ignored  together  with the effect  
of heat output  from the calves.
Perspex  models  to a scale of 1:20 were used in the SFBIU  watertable  
using  an ink tracer  and the general  flow patterns  were traced. There  was 
a slight problem  of stability  with the flow patterns  which  meant  that the 
repeatability  of the patterns  had to be checked  to ensure  that the dom ­
inant pattern  was recorded.
For both buildings  the various  combinations  of pen covers  and pen 
type were examined.  From the range of combinations  used, a selection  
has been made  to illustrate  the main points  arising.
(1) Pen covers. Model  tests were carried  out for both the two-row  
and four-row  calf house  designs  with and without  pen covers  over the rear 
of the calf pens. Omitting  the pen cover  results  in a downcurrent  on the 
opposite  wall to the main air inlet and part of the primary  air flow occurs 
at calf level (Fig. 1).
The presence  of pen covers  raises the lower limit of the primary  air 
flow thereby  effectively  reducing  the air speed at calf level. Secondary,  
slower  flow occurs  beneath  the cover at calf level. In the full-scale  calf 
house this secondary  flow together  with convection  above the calves  en­
sures adequate  ventilation  at calf level.
The pen cover  has a similar  effect  when the air inlets are representing  
space boarding  or when they represent  openings  between  the pen cover 
and the eaves. The latter situation  might be used under summer  condi ­
tions if the ventilation  panels  can hinge  downwards.
(2) Solid versus  open pen fronts. Solid pen fronts also reduce  air 
speeds at calf level but do not prevent  down currents  along the walls 
(Fig. 2).
(3) Solid fronts with pen covers. In model tests where both pen 
covers  and solid fronts  are used the pen cover  tends  to have the dominant  
effect as far as raising  the primary  flow and thereby  reducing  air speed 
at calf level is concerned  (Fig. 3).
45
Fig. 1—Effect  of pen covers  on airflow
The main effect of the cover is to prevent  downcurrents  of air along 
the sides of a calf house. It is primarily  a flow director  and reduces  air 
speeds  at calf level.
There  is no need to insulate  pen covers. Erroneous  statements  regard ­
ing covers  have implied  heat conservation  but the main aim of a cover  
is airflow  direction.  There is also no need to cover any more than the 
rear 800 mm of a pen.
Temperature  patterns  recorded  from thermocouples  in the SFBIU  
climatic  calf house show that temperature  lift beneath  a cover is only 
slight  in a well ventilated  calf house  (Table  2).
In the SFBIU  climatic  calf house, air speeds at calf level did not 
exceed  0.25 m/sec  (50 ft/min)  below  the f)en covers  but speeds  up to 1.25 
m/sec  (200 ft/min)  were recorded  above  the pen covers.

Fig. 3—Effect  of pen covers  and solid fronts  on airflow
Discussion
Both pen covers  and solid pen fronts have an effect on the flow pat­
tern in calf houses  and therefore  an effect on the air speed at calf level.  
The pen cover  has a more marked  effect than solid pen fronts. It is also 
interesting  to note the low air speeds recorded  at calf level during  the 
winter  months  in the SFBIU  climatic  calf house  with pen covers,  and with 
railed  rather  than solid pen fronts.
A completely  solid pen front would have a serious  disadvantage  in 
practice  as feed buckets  would have to be inside  the pen where  they can 
easily be fouled. However  partly solid pen fronts which allowed  calves  
access  to buckets  outside  the pen are possible.
If solid fien fronts  and solid pen divisions  were used, calves  would  not 
w able to see each other which is undesirable.  In certain  cases it might  
be useful to incorporate  an occasional  solid pen division,  e.g. to prevent  
cold draughts  in winter  along  the length  of a calf house. The freedom  of 
choice  regarding  solid and open pen fronts  and divisions  should  be left to 
the discretion  of the designer  concerned.  Simple  model  studies  could be 
used to indicate  the effect  of different  internal  designs.
Let us now consider  two examples  of commercial  naturally  ventilated  
calf houses. Both were designed  some years ago following  interest  by 
farmers  and are typical  of designs  produced  over the years.
Example  A. A large scale naturally  ventilated  calf house  for a farmer  
batch rearing  bought-in  calves.
Having  had experience  of rearing  calves in controlled  environment  
housing  for many years, Mr. J. McFarlane  decided  to choose  climatic  
housing  for the calf unit at Earnslaw,  Leitholm,  Berwickshire.  It has 
advantages  for calf health and management  and is less costly than con­
48
trolled  environment  housing.  The unit is in three sections : nursery,  inter ­
mediate  and follow-on.  The buildings  are straightforward  but great  
attention  has been paid to detail.
Nursery  Building
The nursery  is a long narrow  building  (Fig. 4) measuring  37.000  x 
4.870 X 2.450 m to the eaves (121 x 16 x 8 ft) with traditional  0.610 m 
(2 ft) stone  walls. It is divided  into three sections  by existing  stone walls, 
and it accommodates  84 calves  in three lots of 28 each. It used to be a 
cattle shelter  attached  to open yards. It was gutted,  the openings  were 
built up in salvaged  stone to match the existing  walls and the old low 
dilapidated  slated roof was removed  together  with its timbers,  and re­
placed  by a new roof of coloured  asbestos  on timber  trusses  and purlins.  
Replacing  the entire  roof like this allowed  the eaves height  to be raised  
to 2.450 m (8 ft) and this in turn allowed  1.000 m (3 ft 3 in) deep slatted  
boarding  to be fitted all round. This, together  with the ‘shelf formed  by 
the top of the 0.610  m (2 ft) stone  walls,  ensures  draught-free  inlet ventila ­
tion, and a 0.150  m (6 in) wide continuous  open ridge with upstands  takes  
care of the outlet ventilation.  This ridge is fitted with protective  wire 
mesh to keep out birds.
The individual  pens are 1.520 x 0.910 m (5 x 3 ft) and the divisions  
are of the open sparred  BCX^M  type (Fig. 4). There is a solid back to 
keep the calf off the wall and to prevent  the wall being soiled. The pen 
floors  have a relatively  steep slope of 0.100  in 1.520  m (4 ins in 5 ft) from  
back to front. This ensures  good drainage  and a dry bed. The pens are 
bedded  generously  with straw  twice a day. This makes  for a comfortable  
lie, and also allows  the calves  to eat a certain  amount  of straw. They are 
fed once a day, in the morning.
The nursery  building  is based on the results  of the experimental  work  
on climatic  calf housing  carried  out at the Scottish  Farm Buildings  In­
vestigation  Unit. The building  is naturally  ventilated,  the roof is unin ­
sulated  and no heat is supplied.  The idea is that if the calf has ample  
fresh air, free from draughts,  and has a dry bed, it can stand normal  
winter  temperatures  without  ill effect,  and will in fact be a healthier  and 
hardier  calf. This has been proved  in the unit at Earnslaw.  The mortality  
rate over a period  of seven  years with 4,200  calves  is below  1 %.
Pellets  are on offer after the first few days and the calves  stay in the 
nursery  section  until they are eating  2 lb per head per day (usually  at age 
four or five weeks). Then they move as a batch into four pens to the 
intermediate  building.
Intermediate  building
This is 41.150  x 12.230  x 2.720 m to eaves (135 x 40 x 9 ft) and is a 
new building  (Fig. 4) erected  alongside  the nursery  building  but spaced  
some 7.000 m (23 ft) away. It is of steel frame  construction  with 0.230  m 
(9 in) hollow  block walls and slatted  boarding  all round,  including  the 
gables. The roof is of asbestos  and there is a 0.230 (9 in) continuous  
open ridge with upstands,  again protected  with wire mesh against  birds.

The calves  stay in the intermediate  house  until they are 12 weeks  old, 
and then they move on to the follow-on  section,  which consists  of tradi ­
tional semi-open  straw bedded  courts.
Health. Health  and hygiene  are considered  to be all-important.  The 
walls are sprayed  every fortnight  against  insects. The pen divisions  are 
removed  after every batch and cleaned,  and they are re-creosoted  after  
second  batch. The house is rested for three weeks between  each batch  
and is rested  completely  from August  to October.
A very important  role is played  by the veterinary  surgeon  who sees 
every calf the day after arrival  and there-after  inspects  them once a week.
Labour. The calf unit is run by one man.
Costs. The unit was erected  in 1971 for a gross cost of £11,000,  in­
cluding  demolition  of old buildings,  making  up of site, hardcore  road ­
ways,  and all fixtures  and fittings.
Example  B. A naturally  ventilated  calf house with monopitch  roof 
for a farmer  rearing  home  reared  calves.
Accommodation  was required  by Thornton  Farms  Limited,  Mains  of 
Thornton,  Laurencekirk,  Kincardineshire  for calves  from the dairy herd 
up to four or six months  of age. Cows  were calved  from October  through  
to June mainly  in existing  boxes and at three days the calves would  be 
moved  to the calf house. After discussions  between  the estate  factor,  farm  
manager,  farm building  and veterinary  specialists  and advisers,  the design  
was developed  from the requirements  which  were formulated  at this early  
stage. Visits were made to a number  of calf houses  on other farms,  and 
full account  was taken  of current  research  and development  work on calf 
housing  in the UK.
Basic  requirements
It was decided  that the design  must meet the following  requirements :
1. Accommodation  for 108 calves with ages ranging  from three days 
to six months  at any one time.
2. Individual  penning  for the first two weeks.
3. Potential  for isolation  of groups  or individuals  within  the building.
4. Good  ventilation.
5. A dry bed for all calves.
6. Good  day lighting  and maximum  penetration  of sunlight.
7. Unobstructed  observation  of all calves.
8. Good access  for under-cover  feeding  and general  management.
9. Easily  cleaned  internal  surfaces  at calf level.
10. Easy removal  of muck  by mechanical  means.
11. Three  additional  loose boxes.
12. A feed storage  and preparation  area.
The building
A site was chosen  for a new calf house separate  from existing  tradi ­
tional buildings  and from both foot and wheeled  traffic  associated  with 
older  cattle. It could thus be managed  in isolation  if required.  The loca­
51
tion was in close proximity  to the manager ’s house to encourage  both 
routine  and casual  visits for observation,  and it was convenient  for veter ­
inary  visits and treatment  without  passage  through  other buildings.
It was decided  to use a tethered  feed fence to provide  individual  
accommodation  for calves  during  the first two weeks  in this building.  The 
tethered  feed fence was fitted with milk containers  and rubber teats 
instead  of buckets  in order  to ensure  that the calves  received  milk through  
a teat before moving  to group pens and automatic  feeders. Access  to 
calves  for insjjection  and attention  is much  easier  in a tethered  feed fence  
than in individual  pens and the veterinary  practitioner  supported  this 
view. Details  of the tethered  feed fence were published  (Mitchell,  1972)  
and are also available  as a detailed  drawing.  Calves  would  then be trans ­
ferred  to group  pens and fed by an automatic  machine  until weaning.
The building  (Fig. 5) has a linear  plan. The feed pass, which  is 1.400  
m wide, gives covered  access  to all sections  and to the feed store and pre­
paration  area. A monopitch  roof with the building  facing south-west  
allows  maximum  penetration  of sunlight,  and rooflights  give good day­
lighting  to all parts of the building.  Natural  ventilation  is provided  by an 
opening  beneath  the eaves along the length  of the passage  at the back,  
space boarded  to prevent  strong through-draughts,  and an open front  
which  acts as both an air inlet and outlet. The sheeted  front gates give 
good shelter  to lying animals  in the open-fronted  sections.  Again  model  
studies  were used to ensure  a draught  free internal  environment.
Each section  is divided  off by a partition  of cement  rendered  block- 
work  to a height  of 1.5 m and flat asbestos  on timber framing  above. This 
prevents  facial contact  between  calves in different  sections.  Initially  it 
was planned  to have doors in the passage  between  the separate  sections

to prevent  through-draughts.  Then it was felt that they would hinder  
movement  between  sections  so it was decided  to leave them out unless 
they proved  necessary.
A dry bed was known  to be very important  in all types  of calf housing. 
This is provided  by straw bedding  on 100 mm thick concrete  floors,  with 
a damp  proof  membrane,  laid to falls of approximately  1:20 away from  
the centre  of the pens. This ensures  that any free liquid —urine or spillage 
from drinkers  and feeders —drains  quickly  out of the pens. Straw  usage 
is then minimised  with maximum  calf comfort. The loose boxes are 
drained  separately  from the rest of the building.  The roof is corrugated  
asbestos  cement  sheeting  on steel Z-purlins  supported  by a steel frame. 
No roof insulation  is necessary  in this type of freely ventilated  building  
for calves. There is 3.4 m clear headroom  at the front for mucking  out 
by tractor.
Operation
(1) Calf health and performance.  Approximately  324 calves have 
been reared in this building  from three days of age to five months  at the 
time of writing. Calf health and performance  have been very good. 
Young  calves settled in quickly  and suffered  no appreciable  check on 
sei>aration  from their dams. There has been a complete  absence  of 
respiratory  stress  even at very low temperatures  with high external  winds. 
Observations  by the veterinary  adviser  by day and night showed  rectal  
temperatures,  posture  and behaviour  to be normal  under all conditions.  
General  health and growth  rates have been good and veterinary  costs 
minimal.  Only four calves  have died to date.
Relative  to external  conditions  the building  gives protection  from  
direct precipitation,  provides  a dry bed, and reduces  air velocity  at calf 
level. An open-fronted  monopitch  design  is very unusual  in the north ­
east of Scotland  and it is interesting  to observe  its success  under  severe  
weather  conditions.
(2) Access. The clear passage  width of 1.400 m has been appreci ­
ated by the stockmen  for ease of movement  and feeding. Opening  and 
closing  of doors in the passage  between  sections  would have been a 
nuisance.  Experience  to date and subsequent  model  studies  in the SFBIU  
water table have shown that draughts  were unlikely  to be created  by 
omitting  the doors. Tractor  access  for muck removal  is excellent.
(3) Partitions.  Soft asbestos  panels  were used above  the 1.5 m high 
cement  plastered  blockwork  partitions  between  sections  because  they were  
cheaper  than infilling  completely  with blockwork.  It has been found  that 
calves  are able to reach up and damage  the panels. An extra two courses  
of blocks,  giving  a blockwork  height  of 1.9 m would  have prevented  this.
(4) Flexibility.  The building  is extremely  flexible  in use and spare  
sections  have been used for a variety  of purposes  including  holding  adult  
cows, barley  beef animals  during  the summer  months,  and even machin ­
ery storage. All internal  partitions  are non-load-bearing  and could be 
removed  at a future  date should  a complete  change  of use be required.
53
In both examples  given it is not necessary  to adjust  the building  for 
surnmer  or winter  ventilation.  Space boarding  being fixed is better  than 
a hinged  inlet baffle which may require  adjustment.  In order to reduce  
labour  requirement  demountable  pens are used and tractor  access  is pro­
vided to allow  muck  removal  by tractor  and foreloader.
Basic  layout  and design  check  list
Basic data for calves  up to 12 weeks  of age are given below  together  
with a design  check  list.
Penspace
Age Minimum  space required  per calf
Individual  pens Up to 4 weeks 1.1 m' (1.5 X 0.75 m)
12.5 ft" (5 ft X 2 ft 6 in)
Up to 8 weeks 1.8 mMl.8  X 1.0 m)
19.5 fF (6 ft X 3 ft 3 in)
Group  pens Up to 8 weeks 1.1 m'^ (12.5 ft")
Up to 12 weeks 1.5 m- (16.5 ft-)
Passage  width. Two rows of pens —one on each side of a central  
passage  1.200  m (4 ft).
Single  row of pens on one side of a passage  1.000 m (3 ft 3in). 
Water. Individually  penned —one water  bucket  for each {ten.
Group  penned —one water  bowl for every 10-12 calves.
Trough  frontage.  Feeding  space  for individually  fed calves —350 mm 
(1 ft 2 in) per calf.
Floor  design. Beneath  straw bedding  provide  concrete  floors with a 
slope of at least 1 in 20. Passages  should  be domed  and the floor slope  
in feed storage  areas should  be 1 in 40.
Environmental  requirements
1. Cubic  air capacity  when fully stocked  6 m’/calf (212 ftVcalf).
2. Ventilation.  With eaves  level air inlets  and ridge  outlets  allow  an inlet 
area of 0.045 mV  calf (0.5 fp/calf),  an outlet  area of 0.04 mV  calf (0.4 
ftVcalf)  and 1.5 -2.5 m (5-8 ft) height  difference  between  the two. 
If pens are arranged  along  the sides of a naturally  ventilated  building,  
then a cover  should  be placed  over the rear part of the pen to prevent  
incoming  air from dropping  onto the calves. If fans have to be used 
design  on a basis of 35-105  m’/h (20 - 62 ft^/min)  {>er calf.
Air movement  rate close to the calf, not more than 0.25 m/s (50 ft/ 
min) in winter.
Relative  humidity  and temperature.  No specific  requirements  under  
UK conditions.  Satisfactory  if similar  to outside  conditions.
Insulation  not required.

Ensure  that the following  points  have been clarified  in the final design 
by checking  with the design  data above  or by referring  to Mitchell,  1976.  
The most common  faults  occur  in these aspects.
Drainage.  Are floor slopes  adequate  in pens, passages,  feed storage  
and preparation  area? Are liquids  led out of the building  without  fouling  
working  areas,  without  passing  through  calf pens?
Natural  ventilation.  Is the total air inlet area adequate?  Is the total 
air outlet  area adequate?  Are the inlets  well distributed?  Will the calves 
be free from draughts?
Mechanical  ventilation.  Use manual  NOT thermostatic  fan controls.  
Is fan capacity  adequate  at the working  back pressure?  Is the air inlet 
area adequate?  Are the inlets well distributed?  Will the controls  ensure  
that the ventilation  rate will not go below  the minimum  required?  Will 
the calves  be free from draughts?
Materials  handling.  Is the size of the feed storage  and preparation  
area adequate?  Is it positioned  well in relation  to the calf pens? Can 
bedding  and muck be easily  brought  in and removed  from the building?
Details  are given in the ‘Calf Housing  Handbook ’ by Dan Mitchell,

Summary
In the design  of calf housing  it is essential  to formulate  a detailed  out­
line of the housing  requirements  at the outset  whether  planning  housing  
for home reared or bought-in  calves. By consideration  of the design 
requirement  and eurrently  available  design  data it is possible  to produce  
low cost naturally  ventilated  calf houses  which  will ensure  successful  calf 
rearing  provided  management  and nutrition  are also adequate.

The Influence  of Management  and 
Feeding  Practices  on Calf Performance
R. J. FALLON
Agricultural Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Introduction
A calf rearing  programme  must contain  a management  and feeding  sys­
tem which  minimises  incidence  of disease  and the risk of calf deaths,  and 
simultaneously  provide  satisfactory  calf liveweight  gain. In this paper,  
a number of  factors  which  influence  calf performance  while  it is dependent  
on a liquid  diet are discussed.
Colostrum
A survey  of 1,250 calves purchased  direct from farms or from calf 
auction  marts for Grange  over the last four years showed  that 40% had 
inadequate  blood serum antibody  levels when purchased.  It was shown 
that low antibody  levels  were associated  with increased  rates of mortality  
(Table 1). Blood serum immunoglobulin  (Ig) level of 15-20  ZST units  
provides  moderate  protection.  However,  levels  in excess  of 20 ZST units  
are more desirable.

The low immunoglobulin  levels  obtained  could be due to : —
Weak  calf unable  to suckle  sufficiently  soon after birth.
Calf unable  to suckle  from a cow which  has a pendulous  udder.
Cow may not permit  calf to suckle.
Farmer  may not allow calf to suckle dam and may neglect  to feed 
sufficient  colostrum  to the calf in the first 6 - 12 hrs of life.
Cow may be milked  immediately  after calving  or have leaked  milk 
before  calving  so that the colostrum  available  to the calf is low in 
immunoglobulins.
The calf ’s ability  to injest  sufficient  immunoglobulin  is dependent  on •
(a) the amount  fed— minimum  of 4 kg for a 40 kg calf within 12 hrs of birth;
57
(b) the concentration  of immunoglobulin  in the colostrum  fed—the mean  
immunoglobulin  values  for first, second  and third milkings  after calv­
ing are 11.5, 6.0 and 2.5 gms/ 100 ml respectively;
(c) time of feeding —the calf’s ability  to absorb  the immunoglobulin  frac­
tion of colostrum  has decreased  by half between  birth and 16 hrs and 
has practically  stopped  at 24 hrs after birth.
Ideally,  the calf should  be afforded  the opportunity  to injest its first 
feed of colostrum  from its dam within  6 hrs of birth. This means  that 
the calf should  be assisted  in suckling.  However,  it may be necessary  to 
augment  this suckling  with artificial  feeding  of the colostrum  in parti ­
cular cases.
The alternative  is to artificially  feed the calf first milking  colostrum  
in two feeds, the first feed 4 - 6 hrs after birth and the second  4 - 6 hrs 
later. The calf should  be fed to appetite  with colostrum  that has been 
reheated  to blood temperature.  The calf’s intake from two feeds is 
approximately  10% of calf body weight  and this should  provide  most  
calves  with adequate  antibody  protection  (Table  2).

Calf type
Studies  over a three year period  at Grange  have shown  a positive  rela­
tionship  between  weight of calf at purchase  and subsequent  survival 
(Table  3). These  results  indicate  that in order to minimise  loses, particu ­
larly when large numbers  are being  purchased,  the stronger/heavier  type 
of calf must be bought.  This type is also likely  to be older.
When the price paid for calves  at auction  markets  is examined,  it is 
found  that the price paid is related  to size of calf (Table  4).

The purchaser  at the auction  mart pays a higher  price for the older  
heavier  calf. Therefore  it will be in the producer ’s interest  to keep the 
calf on the home farm for the first 2 to 3 weeks  so that it will be at least 
45 kg at time of sale. Such a calf should  present  minimum  rearing  prob ­
lems for the purchaser.  A three week old calf should  logically  cost £ 10- 
El 5 more than a calf less than one week old due to : 
a) Saving  to purchaser  of three week old calf :
b)i) lower level of mortality  (2% instead  of 8%) £3.50

Production  targets
The targets  for calf growth  in artificial  rearing  are given in Table 5. 
These targets  are readily  attainable  and when they are not achieved  the 
calf rearing  system  should  be analysed  with particular  reference  to feed 
inputs  and incidence  of disease. The calf, in order to attain  these target  
weight  gains (Table  5), will require  20 - 25 kg of milk replacer  and 80 - 100 
kg of calf concentrates.

Calf feeding  schedule
The feeding  schedule  in Table  6 will provide  the necessary  feed inputs  
to attain  the above  target  weights.

These feed inputs may be increased  to provide  greater  initial live- 
weight  gains. Table 7 shows the liveweight  gains which were obtained  
when  25, 37 and 50 kg of milk replacer  were fed over a 7 - 56 day period  
at Grange.  However,  the medium  and high planes  of nutrition  in Table  7 
have a number  of disadvantages :
a) greater  incidence  of scour  and risk of higher  mortality;  
higher  inputs  of milk replacer;  
lower  intakes  of concentrates;
greater  risk of over-feeding,  namely  a severe  digestive  upset  occurring  
when calf is placed  on the high feeding  initially.

Effect  of management  practices  on calf performance  
on automatic  feeders
Recent  research  on automatic  calf feeders  at Grange  shows  that dif­
ferent  methods  of introducing  calves  to the automatic  feeder  did not affect  
subsequent  calf performance  (Table  9).

Preparing  the calf for the automatic  feeder  by pail or nipple  feeding  
for seven days prior to introduction  on to feeder  did not improve  calf 
performance  and would  not be advocated  as a routine  practice.
A second  experiment  showed  that by increasing  the concentration  of 
milk replacer  fed from the feeder,  when  the calves  were first introduced  to 
the feeder,  resulted  in seven  deaths  out of 40 calves  (Table  10).
When  the calves  were fed from an automatic  feeder  which  dispersed  
a 20% solution  of milk replacer  (1 kg in 5 litres of water),  the treatment  
had to be discontinued  after three days because  of illness  and deaths. It 
was concluded  that the initial  concentration  of 20% is unsuitable  where 
bought-in  calves  were first introduced  to the automatic  feeder. It is there ­
fore not recommended.

Another  experiment  at Grange  examined  the effect of weaning  calves 
abruptly  off an automatic  feeder  when they had consumed  either 30 kg 
or 50 kg milk replacer.  Weaning  off the feeder  when  the calves  consumed  
30 kg of milk replacer  resulted  in a severe check in growth  rate after 
weaning  (Table  11), due to low concentrate  consumption  before  weaning. 
The average  daily concentrate  consumption  for the seven days before 
weaning  was only 0.1 kg per day for the calves  weaned  when fed 30 kg 
of milk replacer  compared  to 0.4 kg per day for the calves  weaned  when 
fed 50 kg of milk replacer.

Automatic  calf feeders  reduce  the labour  inputs  required  in calf rear­
ing and allow for redeployment  of farm labour. However,  the use of 
automatic  calf feeders  requires  vigilant  stockmanship  by the operator.
Automatic  feeder —critical  management  aspects
* Daily  intake  of milk replacer  by the calf is not controlled.
* Bought-in  calves are liable to overfeed  when first introduced  to the 
feeder.
* Avoid  mixing  very young  calves  with 4 - 5 week old calves,  particu ­
larly on dairy farms.
* Calf fed on automatic  feeder  requires  40 - 50 kg of milk replacer.
62
* Calves  on automatic  feeders  have a loose faeces  due to high input of 
milk replacer.
* There  is difficulty  in getting  some calves  which  are on ad libitum  milk 
to eat sufficient  concentrates  before  weaning.
Cost of calf rearing —7-84 days
Costs are summarised  as follows :
System 1 : Pail feeding  7-75 days— input of 25 kg of milk replacer  and 
95 kg of calf concentrate.  Liveweight  gain 0.60 kg/day.
System  2: Automatic  feeding  7 - 63 days —input of 50 kg of milk re­
placer  and 53 kg of calf concentrate.  Liveweight  gain 0.65

Factors  Affectinjj;  Milk Yield per Cow
P. A. GLEESON
Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
Milk yield per cow is of critical  importance  in defining  farm income  on a 
well stocked  dairy farm. Optimum  dairy farm management  however  re­
quires both high stocking  rate and high milk yield per cow. These  dual 
objectives  can be obtained  at the same time and they are not antagonistic  
to each other. It is easier  to increase  stocking  rate on dairy farms  than to 
increase  milk yield per cow. The discussion  on increasing  milk yield per 
cow in Ireland  has been mainly  in terms of animal  breeding  and feeding.  
While these factors  are important,  they are only two of the many herd 
management  details  which  determine  milk yield per cow within  herds.
The factors affecting  cow milk yield are best presented  within the 
three categories  shown  in Table 1. The first factor,  potential  of the cow, 
is mainly  influenced  by breeding,  size and age at first calving.  Effects  of 
breeding  both from the male and female  side will not be discussed  in this 
paper.  Size and age at first calving  are important  determinants  in influenc ­
ing both first lactation  yields and possibly  have major  influences  on the 
life time performance  of the animal.
The management  of the dairy  cow during  the lactation and  dry periods  
will be discussed  under  the influence  of feeding,  time of calving  and lac­
tation  number.  However,  two other  factors  are important,  namely,  disease  
control  during  the season  and good milking  management.
The rate of culling  and degree  of mortality  in herds  have a big impact  
on output  from dairy herds. Culling  is influenced  by the number  of herd 
replacements  available  in the herd, the disease  state of the herd and the 
fertility  of the herd. These  three factors  determine  the rate at which  cull­
ing takes place in the herd in any one year.

Trends  in milk yields  and stocking  rate on Irish dairy  farms
In recent times it appeared  that milk yield per cow was increasing. 
However  the more recent statistics  indicate  that the national  yield per 
cow is still less than 600 gallons. This has been confirmed  in a recent  
survey  (Table  2) on a national  basis. The average  yield per cow was 579 
gallons.  There  was however,  a higher  milk yield in the Munster  area, the 
traditional  dairying  area of the country,  but even in that province  average 
milk yield per cow was only 623 gallons.  A further  disconcerting  feature  
emerging  from this survey  is the low average  stocking  rate of approxi-  
mately  two forage  acres per livestock  unit. It is against  this background  
that I propose  to deal with some aspects  which influence  milk yield per 
cow.

Weight  at first calving
There is little information  available  on the optimum  weight  to calve 
down two year old heifers  and its effect on subsequent  lactations.  An 
experiment  is presently  in progress  at the Agricultural  Institute  Field  
Station,  Ballyragget,  Co. Kilkenny,  where two year old Friesian  spring  
calving  heifers  were divided  into four treatment  groups  to compare  the 
effect of weight  at first calving  on lactation  performance.  Two groups  had 
a target weight  of 1,000 lbs weight  before calving  and were stocked  at 
0.95 and 0.75 acres/animal  after calving. The other two groups  had a 
target weight of 1,150 lbs before calving and were also stocked at 
0.95 and 0.75 acres per cow after calving.  These stocking  rates provide 
grazing  and silage requirements.  The heifers were fed grass silage  
ad libitum  and 12 lbs concentrates/head/day  after calving  until trans ­
ferred to grass in mid-March.  The groups  are rotationallly  grazed  on 
pasture  and 75% of each farmlet  is conserved  for winter  feed.
The average  performance  in the first two lactations  is presented  in 
Table  3.
Since this is a long term study caution  must be observed  in drawing  
conclusions  at this stage. The heavier  animals  in the first lactation  had an 
increased  milk production  of approximately  100 gallons  per heifer. The 
first lactations  in 1976 coincided  with a very dry summer.  This resulted  
in the animals  being in poor body weight  at the end of the first lactation.  
The pre-calving  weights  of all groups  in 1977, start off the second  lacta ­
tion, were only at the same level as at the beginning  of the first lactation.

This had a large influence  on milk yields in the second  lactation  and, in 
some treatments,  it depressed  lactation  yields in the second  year from 
those obtained  in the first lactations.  Those  treatment  groups  with poor  
lactations  in 1977 tended  to compensate  in body weight  and resulted  in 
very good body weight  conditions  at the end of the 1977 lactation  year. 
This increase  in bodyweight  could  have a major  influence  in the lactations  
(third)  at the beginning  of 1978. The only conclusions  one can draw from  
this experiment  at this early stage are: (1) the heavier  the heifer  at first 
calving,  the higher  the milk yield; (2) if animals  are not given an oppor ­
tunity to increase  body condition  between  the first and second  calvings 
milk yield can be depressed  in the second  lactation  and (3) animals  tend 
to gain extra weight  during  the second  lactation  at the expense  of milk 
production.

dicate  the relative  importance  of the components  of a dairy cow ’s diet.

Pre-calving  feeding
Body  reserves  built up during  the dry period  can be utilised  to support  
milk production  in early lactation.  During  the last eight  weeks  Preceedmg 
parturition,  a liveweight  gain of 1.5 lbs per day is desirable  An outl ne 
of how these levels  of gam can be attained  with various  levels  of feeds  
illustrated  in Table 5. These figures  are only a guideline  and show how 
the type and quantity  of roughage  fed, influence  the level of concentra  
feeding  required  with poor quality  feeds. These  figures  are based  on cows  
weighing  10 cwts and a silage  with a dry matter  of 20

The figures  show that increasing  the concentrate  level results  in a de­
pression  of silage intake by the dairy cow. This table also shows the 
degree  to which  body condition  or bodyweight  loss can influence  the milk 
pr^uction  obtained  per cow at various  feeding  levels Thus,  as concen ­
trate feeding  levels increase,  there is a reduction  in silage intake an in­
crease  in milk production  and a decrease  in bodyweight  loss by the cow.
68
Silage  quality  and milk yield
Silage  quality  is influenced  by the quality  of the material  ensiled,  and 
the efficiency  of preservation.  Voluntary  intakes  of silage  conserved  “Om 
poor quality  material  or which are poorly  preserved  are very low and 
large inputs  of concentrates  are required  to supplement  low intakes.  Table  
7 illustrates  the level of concentrates  required  for varying  milk production  
levels depending  on silage quality.  The additional  concentrates  required  
with poor quality  silage  in order  to achieve  the same level of milk  produc ­
tion as with good silage is about 8 lb per cow per day. Over a winter  
period  this can amount  to £33 per cow.

A guideline  to the possible  levels  of concentrates  to be fed after calv­
ing to spring  calving  cows in 1978 is shown  in Table  8. The figures  show  
that as the level of feeding  increases  the response  to extra coricentrates  
decreases  when measured  over the full lactation.  With a possible  price 
of 50p per gallon  for milk in 1978 and the concentrates  costing  £120 per 
ton, the economic  level of concentrate  feeding  with good silage should  
be between  15 - 16 lb per cow per day.

Effect  of wilting  on silage  quality
Table 9 shows that wilting  resulted  in increased  silage dry matter  
intakes  and reduced  body weight  losses. However,  there was very little 
effect on milk yield per cow in this experiment.

Concentrate  feeding  on grass
There  is very little limited  information  in the influence  of concentrate  
feeding  on pasture  in early spring. This type of experimentation  is diffi­
cult because  the conditions  vary as grass growth  improves  with the ad­
vancing  season and the need for supplementation  generally  decreases.  
The Moorepark  recommendations  have been to feed the same quantity  of 
concentrates  for the first two weeks  after turnout  as were fed during  the 
indoor  period. The level of feeding  should  then be reduced  by half for 
the next ten days and phased  out completely,  with the exception  of a 
small quantity  of meals  to carry calcined  magnesite  until the end of May.
An experiment  was carried  out in 1977 when concentrates  were fed 
from March  21st to May 25th as follows :
(i) no supplementation;
(ii) 10 lbs molasses  per head per day;
(iii) 7 lbs barley  per head per day.
The cows were stocked  at 0.7 acres per cow for a 63 day feeding  period.  
The mean  calving  date of this herd was January  20th. Difficulty  was ex­
perienced  in getting  the cows to eat their respective  quantity  of feeds and 
in the molasses  group  some barley  was introduced  to entice  them to take 
their ration. Over the total period  the quantities  of feed consumed  were  
approximately  half of their allotted  allowance.  However,  the quantities  
consumed  did not influence  either  milk yield or body weight  during  the 
experimental  period.
A similar  type experiment  was carried  out from July 29th to Novern-  
ber 25th, 1976 when  cows were stocked  at 0.8 acre per cow. This experi ­
ment consisted  of three treatment  groups :
(i) control  with no feed;
(ii) 10 lbs molasses/head/day;
(iii) 7.5 lbs barley -t-2 lbs of soyabean  per head per day.
The objective  was to determine  the effects of supplementary  feeding  in 
the latter part of lactation.  The animals  on trial were milking  over 2j
70
gallons  when introduced  to their feed. The supplemented  groups in­
creased  milk production  over the control  groups  but there was no dif­
ference  between  the two types of supplementation.  The control  group  
produced  less milk and had a shorter  lactation  length.  However,  one could  
not economically  justify  this supplementation  at the end of the lactation.  
Further  studies  on this subject  are proposed.
The influence  of stocking  rate on dairy  merit
It was stated earlier  that high stocking  rate and high milk yield per 
COW were not incompatable.  The results  from an experiment  which  has 
been carried  out for three years  at the Curtin's  farm at Moorepark  demon ­
strating  stocking  rate and dairy merit  are shown  in Table 10.

Low merit  6.5 cwt
This experiment  involves  four groups  of animals,  two highly  selected 
groupis  and two groups  whose yields are close to the national  average. 
Within  each selection,  cows are stocked  at either  one acre per cow or 0.8 
acres per cow. The results  show that at one cow per acre with an input  
of over 8 cwts concentrates  it is possible  to achieve  close to 1,000 gallons  
per cow and per acre. Increasing  stocking  rate from 1 to 0.8 has depressed  
milk production  in both the high and low merit cows. This has been a 
feature  of stocking  rate work in recent  years which may well be associ ­
ated with the dry summers  experienced  in 1976 and 1977. These  depres ­
sions would  justify  increasing  stocking  rates to high levels at the present  
time. The proportion  of yield produced  Indoors  reflects  the overall  lacta ­
tion yields in the high merit cows. A useful  guide to early calving  is the 
percentage  of milk produced  between  calving  and the end of May which  
has been approximately  54% in this experiment.  This result emphasises  
the value  of early calving,  good quality  winter  feed with supplementation,  
and very good grassland  management  in the early part of the season. 
One further  pioint illustrated  by the result is the need for a long lactation  
in order  to obtain  high milk yields.
71
The influence  of early calving  is further endorsed  by the data presented 
in Table 11. These  data are taken  from some of the Moorepark  herds  and 
illustrate  that late calving  decreases  milk yield per cow and lactation  
length. When  the January  and April yields  are compared  there is a drop  
of 38 gallons  per month  for each months  delay in calving  date. The data 
from An Foras Taluntais  survey  of 700 farms in 1976 indicate  the effect  
of early calving  on milk yield as shown  in Table 12.

Control  of culling  in dairy  herds
Data from eight herds in Moorepark  were used to establish  average  
values for culling  and mortality  and to indicate  those factors  requiring  
particular  attention  in order to eliminate  mortality  and involuntary  cull­
ing. The data are based  on a period  covering  six years  from 1969 to 1975.  
Of the results  for culling  only those  cows culled  for ‘low milk production ’ 
or 'late calving ’ may be classified  as ‘voluntary  culling ’, i.e. 2.8 in the 
total culling  rate of 19.8. High losses  of animals  due to involuntary  cull­
ing will consistently  reduce  the possibility  of improving  herd milk yields 
by reducing  the number  of cows that can be culled on low yield. The 
major  cause  of involuntary  culling  is infertility.  This factor  accounted  for 
39.3%  of all culled  cows or 7.8% of all cows. The factors  that contribute  
to infertility  have been shown  to be mainly  due to repeat breeders. In 
addition,  up to 10% of cows culled  for infertility  may in fact be in calf. 
Furthermore,  the late calvers  may not have been offered  for service  for 
more than one or two services,  and this will contribute  to the number  
culled  as being  infertile  within  a compact  calving  season.  The culling rates  
indicated  in Table 14 are similar  to those obtained  by K. J. O’Farrell  (An 
Foras  Taluntais,  Moorepark)  in a recent  survey  of dairy farms  in the Fer­
moy area.

The key factor  for early compact  calving  is good heat detection.  An 
outline  of the number  of observations  required  for good heat detection  
is shown  in Table 15. Studies  at Moorepark  have shown  that the average  
duration  of heat is quite short. Over 33% of heats are less than 6 hours  
in duration,  and cows can come on heat for short periods  several  times a 
day. Thus, the importance  of frequent  heat observations  during  the day 
cannot  be over-emphasised.

Number  of replacement  heifers
The high incidence  of involuntary  culling  has allowed  very low culling 
rates of low milk producers  in Irish dairy herds. Between  18 and 20% 
of cows are culled  annually  and mostly  for reasons  other  than yield. The 
recent  figures  for replacement  heifers  from the Central  Statistic  s Office  
indicate  that the number  of in-calf  heifers  being reared is considerably  
less than 20% of the national  herd. This may have major implications  
with the eradication  of brucellosis  in the future because  present  culling 
rates on an involuntary  basis will not allow for replacement  of those  ani­
mals being  culled  for brucellosis.  If the two problems  of eliminating  low 
yielders  by the introduction  of additional  replacement  heifers and the 
eradication  of brucellosis  are introduced  to farms,  then increased  num ­
bers of heifers  must be reared. The question  then arises : where  do these 
come from?
Table 16 presents  two possible  replacement  policies.  The first example  
is a 100 cow herd in which  the cows are put in calf to dairy sires and the 
heifers  at the 20% replacement  rate are put in calf to beef type bulls,  such 
as the Angus  for easy calving.  After allowing  for mortality  and animals  
not going in calf there is a maximum  of 31 calves  available  as replace ­
ment heifers.  But these heifer  calves  could  have been born between  Janu ­
ary and July, thus making  compact  calving  for heifers  impossible  if the 
maximum  number  of animals  are selected.
In the second  example  both the heifers  (if they are bred from high- 
yielding  cows and nominated  sires they should  be good genetic  material)  
and dairy cows are bred to dairy sires. The number  of possible  heifer  
replacements  is increased  to 39 heifers  from 100 animals.  The table clearly 
outlines  the type of strategies  which must be considered  if \ve are to in­
crease the culling  for low yielders,  eradication  of brucellosis  and T.B., 
and expand  the national  herd.
Summary
In this paper a number  of factors  that affect milk yield per cow have 
been considered.  Increased  milk yields  per cow will be obtained  by breed-

ing which is long term in nature. Increasing  the weight  at first calving 
has a large influence  on initial milk yields and may have effects  on the 
total life-time  performance  of the animal. The important  management  
factors  to increase  milk yields per cow depend  on better feeding,  early  
calving,  developing  a mature  herd, good disease  control  and efficient  
milking  management.  Finally,  to allow milk yields to increase,  both 
culling  and mortality  must be improved  in all herds. The factor  of high 
infertility  alone which accounts  for between  7 to 10% of all cows in the 
country  being culled annually  will demand  greater  attention  from dairy  
farmers  in the future. It is only by selecting  more replacement  heifers 
and heifers  of high quality  that higher  milk yield per cow can be achieved.

Managing  and Motivating  the 
Dairy Worker
M. F. SEABROOK
School  of Agriculture,  University  of Nottingham.
I. Introduction
Agriculturalists  are often complacent  about  man management  because  of 
a feeling  that agricultural  workers  are more satisfied  than their industrial  
counterparts.  However,  there is growing  evidence  that this is probably  
not true and it is the deferential  position  of agricultural  workers  which  
prevents  the full expression  of their dissatisfaction  in agriculture.  The gap 
in life styles between  employer  and employee  is all too often ignored  in 
agriculture  but it is likely  in the future  to be a cause  of friction  and unrest.
The general  objective  of this paper is to discuss  man management  in 
agricultural  activities  in order to achieve  more effective  worker  perfor ­
mance. The basic theme is that men have needs,  some common  to all, 
some more specific,  and that successful  management  and motivation  is 
concerned  with identifying  these needs and providing  the right mix of 
rewards  to enable  the worker  to fulfill these needs inside  and outside  his 
work situation.
II. Definitions
A. Job Satisfaction.  A feeling  of positive  effect : produced  by satisfac ­
tion of important  needs; in conjunction  with a feeling  that these  
needs could not have been better  or more easily satisfied  in a com­
parable  job; such perceptions  being with respect  to the job as a 
whole,  i.e. satisfaction  results  from need fulfilment.
B. Job Enrichment.  Adding  additional  elements  to the job to make it 
more demanding  and rewarding;  filling higher  needs and arousing  
human  needs.
C. Motivation.  The instigation  and direction  of behaviour  aimed at 
satisfying  a need. Motivation  is the drive or urge to behave  in a cer­
tain way; the driving  force to act in a particular  manner  in order to 
achieve  certain  ends or objectives.  One may regard  motivated  be­
haviour  as extending  between  two poles.
In order to understand  motivated  behaviour  one has to consider :
a) Which  goals and outcomes  are sought  by an individual  (i.e. what  
needs  is one seeking  to satisfy).
b) What are the factors  influencing  this choice  for the individual.
c) What determines  the behaviour  a person  will be motivated  to 
adopt in order to reach the goals and outcomes  thought  desir ­
able.
D. Intrinsic  Work Factors.  Factors  associated  with the nature  of work  
itself,  e.g. feelings  of achievement,  responsibility,  recognition.
E. Extrinsic  Work Factors. Factors  associated  with the environment  
in which  the job operates,  e.g. pay and working  conditions.
77
111. The needs  of man
In order to effectively  manage  and motivate  the worker  one needs to 
consider  the motivation  and needs  of individual  members  of staff. There  
is no easy blue print to managing  staff. Attention  needs to be paid to 
individual  differences  and not to assume  all employees  want and react to 
the same thing,  since behaviour  is related  to the fulfilment  of needs.
Maslow,  A. H. put forward  a theory  of the hierarchy  of human  needs. 
He advanced  the concept  of five basic categories  of human  needs being 
of varying  degrees  of potency.  He asserts  as a general  principle  that the 
satisfaction  of each group  of needs is a prerequisite  to the experience  of 
the next group of needs in the hierarchy,  hence ungratified  needs moti ­
vate.
Biological  needs (the most basic needs). These may be collectively 
described  as the need to survive : the need for fresh air for food,  drink,  
warmth,  sex, etc. They are provided  for through  the medium  of eco­
nomic  rewards  in more advanced  societies.  Such basic needs  must be 
satisfied  before  a person  is motivationally  aware  of the next group  of 
needs  —
Safety  and security  needs. In the work  situation,  these needs  are mani ­
fest in a preoccupation  with redundancy,  the maintenance  of pay dif­
ferentials,  the provision  of pensions  and, particularly  in agriculture,  
security  of tenure  in farm cottages.  Once they are satisfied  attention  
is turned  to —
The need for affection.  This social  need derives  from the pleasure  of 
associating  with others,  of belonging  to a group  and conforming  to its 
rules and conventions.  The implications  for management  will concern  
the leadership  processes  of the working  group. Following  the satis­
faction  of such needs  attention  turns to —
The need  for esteem.  Maslow  distinguishes  two classes  of needs  within 
this category —firstly  the need for achievement,  for independence  and 
for a sense of personal  worth,  all of which may be described  as the 
need for self-esteem.  Secondly  there is the desire for the esteem  of 
others;  the need to earn a reputation,  to experience  recognition  and 
appreciation  in one ’s achievements.  Providing  satisfaction  of these  
psychological  needs is a most important  part of motivational  policy 
in any business.  The drive  to fulfill  these  needs  may mean  that people 
reject their working  groups  and would rather work alone than as a 
member  of a group. If fulfilled,  the person  will then become  aware  
and finally  require  fulfilment  of his —
Self-actualisation  needs. This is the highest  level of human  needs in 
the hierarchy  and in a job sense is reached  by only the fortunate  few. 
It is the need of a man to become  everything  of which  he is capable.  
The provision  of a work environment  is which each individual  may 
aspire  to his full potential  is the challenge  it gives to Management.
The general  pattern  of needs is consistent  person  to person  but these  
needs are in turn modified  by such factors  as personality,  age and up­
bringing.
78
There  are many  other  theories  of human  behaviour.  Hertzberg,  Maus-  
ner and Syndermann  (1959) put forward  the view that the factors  pro­
ducing  dissatisfaction  in the job were concerned  with non fulfilment  of 
extrinsic  factors  (e.g. pay and working  conditions)  and satisfaction  only 
arose when intrinsic  factors  were present  (e.g. achievement  and recogni ­
tion). Basically  the dissatisfiers  correspond  with Maslow ’s lower needs, 
the satisfiers  with Maslow ’s higher  needs.
The strength  of an individuals  preference  for any factor in his work  
is possibly  dependent  on the extent  to which he believes  it will help him 
to obtain  other  outcomes  which  he feels are desirable.  It also shows  that 
people  may seek one goal in order  to fulfill other  needs  and goals outside  
their work.
IV. Work  behaviour
The objective  of effective  man management  is to promote  favourable  
work behaviour.  One can assume  that the behaviour  of all workers  is 
directed  by a fairly rigid set of drives,  modified  by such factors  as early  
upbringing,  personality,  age, experience,  family commitments,  family 
pressures,  the drive to develop  an individual  role, and the role forced  
on a person  by group  membership  and management  actions.  In all these  
processes  there may be a conflict  between  group  and management  expec ­
tations  and the individual ’s personality  resources  and assets.
Theories  of work behaviour  (or motivation  theories)  need to consider  
both the objectives  sought  and the behaviour  used to reach the objectives. 
If one accepts  the basic concepts  of utility  theory  then theories  such as 
those of Vroom  (1964)  and Lawler  (1973)  help explain  behaviour.  These  
effectively  state that man chooses  that behaviour  from a number  of plans  
of behaviour,  which he expects  will provide  the best outcome  as he sees 
it in terms of meeting  the needs he had. This enables  one to consider  
that —
A) Individuals  place different  values  on various  outcomes.
B) People  have expectations  about the possibility  that a certain  effort  
will lead to a certain  behaviour.
C) People  have expectations  about the possibility  that this behaviour  
will lead to certain  outcomes.
If one considers  the determinant  of the effort a person  puts into a 
job, it is the perceived  value to the person  individually  of the likely out­
come of that effort. Thus each individual  has a distinct  set of values  
which  he places  on any likely outcome.  These  values  will be determined  
by many factors  Including  his own personality,  upbringing,  family  and 
group  pressures  and the needs he has to fulfill. Effort in order to maxi ­
mise performance  will only occur if the perceived  value of the outcome  
had the highest  value  to the person.
Expectancy  theory  states that both extrinsic  and intrinsic  factors  can 
satisfy,  and also motivate,  but some people  may be more strongly  moti ­
vated by extrinsic  factors  and some by intrinsic  factors. Secondly,  satis­
faction  is not to be equated  with motivation  but rather  that satisfaction  
will be associated  with motivation  only to the extent  that it is the result
79
of valued  rewards  that are believed  by the employee  to be contingent  upon  
the performance  to be motivated.  A person  might be satisfied  with his 
pay for example,  but pay would motivate  him to perform  well only if 
good performance  was expected  to result in increased  pay. Actions  will 
be associated  with varying  degrees  of profitability  of outcomes.  These  
outcomes  will have value for an individual  when they satisfy  needs he 
has, and the value will vary with the need strength.  In any situation  a 
person  will act so as to maximise  the expected  value of outcomes.
V. Rewards
Man has needs and society  and management  should  provide  rewards  
which  meet these needs,  i.e. if one is hungry  then food is a good reward.
The outcome  of rewards  offered  by management  are complicated  by 
the fact that it is the perceived  value of that reward  which is important  
(see Fig. 1).

There is always  a danger  of management  using its perception  of the 
value of the rewards  which  are not necessarily  the same as that perceived  
by the worker. When one considers  the link between  rewards  and the 
effort one can classify  rewards  as follows :
A) Rewards  not valued (e.g. for the individual  worker  this may be 
affiliation).
B) Rewards  valued  but not dependant  on effort (e.g. time off).
C) Rewards  valued  and dependant  on effort (e.g. recognition).
The value  of rewards  and the rewards  sought  change  over time. Gener ­
ally the greater  the value of a set of rewards  and the higher  the probabil-  
ity that receiving  each of these rewards  depends  upon effort the greater  
effort will be put into any situation.
VI. The interface  between  man and cows
The first sections  of this paper  have outlined  some of the components  
u ^'^^y in which  the worker  (or farmer)  behaves.  When  one considers  
the dairy section  there is another  important  aspect,  i.e. the relationship  
between  man and cows. Analysis  of observations  made  on cow and cow­
men behaviour  show  that personality  traits  of cowmen  are correlated  with 
herd yield and that all factors  being  equal the confident  introvert  person-  
ality type (behaviour)  tended  to develop  a better relationship  with cows  
and that this good relationship  between  man and cows significantly  in­
creased  the milk yield of cows.
A nalysis
Some  forty commercial  Friesian  herds  operating  as one man units  have 
personality  of the cowman  analysed.  The herds  with 
50 - 80 cows, autumn  calving  and feeding  1,400 - 1 600 kgs per cow/year
u feed,  were isolated  and for the twenty  herds in the category
the following  emerges.

The general  symptoms  of a good relationship  
between  man and cow
a) Cows  come more easily  to the collecting  yard.
b) Cows  come more easily  into the parlour.
c) Cows  are less restless  and dung less in the parlour.
d) The cowman  pats and touches  the cows.
e) The cows do not move  away when approached  by the cowman.
f) The cows come  to the cowman  when  out in the field (short  flight  
distance).
B. The behaviour  to adopt
It is now possible  to draw up a generalised  check  list of the desirable  
factors  to look for when selecting  a new cowman.
However,  these are difficult  traits to assess and there are really very 
many other factors  to consider  and which may have important  results. 
Also many farmers  do the milking  themselves  or have a herdsman  who 
seems  to be very satisfactory  even if he does not totally  match  up to the 
generalised  specification.  The more satisfactiry  solution  is to modify  the 
farmer  and cowman ’s behaviour  so that he achieves  a better  relationship  
with his cows. This can be done by ensuring  that certain  activities  which 
cows dislike  are avoided  and certain  activities  which they like are de­
veloped.  This should  have a beneficial  effect on milk yield.
Cows can be made to like their cowman  by receiving  favourable  
stimuli  when they are with him. If they associate  the cowman  and the 
parlour  with pleasant  sensations  they will come in willingly,  want to be 
with the cowman  and be under  less stress whilst  there.
The following  is a part of the behaviour  modification  programme :
When  rounding  up the cows  for milking :
DO’S
—Walk  up to the cow quietly,
—Call to let them know your are 
rounding  them up,
—Walk  confidently  up to the cows  
and stroke  them.DO NOT ’s
—Hit cows with sticks or other  
objects,  make  them run,
—Crowd  them through  gateways, 
shout  unduly  at them.
Herding  cows  into milking  parlour :
—Allow  cows to enter parlour  un­
hurriedly  and in their  own order  
(if they hang back — find out 
why).
—Approach  those cows hanging  
back with gentle  talk and walk 
them into the parlour  with a 
confident  manner.-Confuse  or upset  cows by trying 
to rush.
82
Preparing  cows for milking :
-Let cow know where you are 
by talking  to her then stroking  
her with your hand moving 
towards  the udder,
-ALWAYS  stick to the routine  
the cow is used to.
Make special  effort to reassure  
nervous  cow or heifer,
-Ensure  your behaviour  is con­
sistent,  a given reaction  of cow 
should  always  elicit the consis-  
tant reaction  by you.Make  sudden,  unexpected  
movements,  handle udder un­
expectedly,  or roughly.
Leaving  the parlou]'  after mUking  :
—Hurry  cows out of parlour.  
Make  cows reluctant  to come  in 
next time,  due to fear of cow­
man.—Let the cows walk out at their  
own speed and in their own 
order.
—Encourage  first cow to move by 
a gentle  pat if necessary.
Calving :
The cow is particularly  sensitive  to new stimuli  at this time. Make  
sure your actions  to her are favourable  and pleasant,  as she will remem ­
ber if they are not !
DO NOT ’s 
—Be impatient,  
—Flap.DO’S
—Talk to cow in gentle  tone,
—Make steady quiet movements  
round  cow,
—Be confident  and in control,
—This is an opportunity  to create  
a relationship  of trust between  
man and cow—make a fuss of 
her, rub her udder,  scratch  her 
face, rump,  etc.
First few milkings :
During  this time the cow is under  stress and sensitive  to new stimuli,  
the routine  is changing  and she misses  her calf. You must be a substitute  
for the calf. You must encourage  her to eat as much as possible  and to 
let her milk down  freely.
—Get the cow to think that milk ­
ing is a pleasant  experience,
—Make sure you touch the cow 
gently  and speak  kindly  to her,
—Handle  udder  carefully,
—Talk to her.—Cause  cow pain or stress,
—Make  cow frightened,  or 
“dread ” milking,
—If cow knocks unit off, calm  
her down before trying to put 
unit on again.
83
In conclusion  it can be said that sensation  of pleasure  are reinforced  
by reward  feeding,  patting,  and tone of voice on approaching  cow. Un­
pleasant  feelings  are minimised  by elimination  of unfavourable  treatment,  
especially  in the parlour  and at calving.
A sound  relationship  is based  on communication  and confidence.  Thus  
the competent  cowman  on top of his job talks to his cows when they are 
under  stress,  as during  milking.  He uses a pleasant  voice but at times he 
displays  the necessary  dominance,  since cows can sense worry  in the cow­
man when he is dealing  with them.

A. Check  the formal  structure  of the farm, i.e. 
and appraisal.
Check  chain  of commands,  communication  processes,  etc. This over­
comes  the problem  of instruction  being  given by more than one per­
son.
Consider  the problems  of the interface  between  animal  and man on 
the dairy farm.
Look at the jobs on the farm and modify  if necessary  using the fol­
lowing criteria which includes  positive  consideration  of human  
characteristics  and needs.
a) optimum  variety  of tasks and skills;
b) some control  over methods,  pace and sequence;
c) a meaningful  and compatible  pattern  of tasks making  a recognis ­
able contribution;
d) optimum  length  of work cycle;
e) feedback  on performance,  as far as possible  through  the work 
itself;
f) opportunity  for learning  and development;
g) opportunity  for contact  and collaboration  with others.
D. Consider  and rate each job on the following  criteria ;
Skill variety  “
Task identity — 
Task significance  — 
Autonomy  —
Feedback
KnowledgeThe degree  to which  skill variety  is necessary 
in a job.
How far the job is a complete  entity.
The impact  of the job on the lives of others. 
The degree to which the job provides  the 
worker  with independence,  freedom,  and de­
cision  making.
How much  effective  feedback  occurs.
Degree  to which knowledge  is acquired  re­
lated and used.
Atternpt  to put yourself  in the place of the person  being managed,  
examine  the following  points :
Communications :
i worker  must have knowledge  of aims of the business;
ii worker  must have information  to do job well;
iii worker  must pass on information  to supervisors;
iv worker  must feel action  is taken  on information  given.
84
b) Personal  Relationship :
i teamwork;
ii close  relationship  with supervisors;
iii help and co-operation  with colleagues;
iv worker must feel he can influence  his workplace  activities,  
methods  and standards.
c) Control :
i worker  must feel he can control  his work and methods;
ii workers  must have influence  over others whose  job affects his 
work;
iii group  consultation  on job methods;
iv checking  of work standards.
d) Leadership ;
i worker  must have confidence  in top management/immediate  
superior;
ii management  must try to understand  work problems;
iii management  must value and invite opinions  on all aspects  of 
the work;
iv workers  efforts  must be appreciated;
V a consistent  action  and reaction  is important.
e) Decision  making :
i decisions  should be made on all levels — worker  must have  
opportunity  to take decisions;
ii management  must be aware of work problems  when it makes  
decisions;
iii workers ’ ideas must influence  decisions  made.
f) Work  targets ;
i workers  must be involved  in setting  targets;
ii targets  must be clearly  defined;
iii targets  must be acceptable;
iv a sense of achievement  must be got from the job.
g) Performance  standards :
i ensure  job cannot  be improved  by using new methods;,
ii avoid  waste;
iii ensure  correct  training  given;
iv ensure  jobs as whole  well organised  (e.g. all daily jobs not just 
milking).
But at all times consider  the worker  as an individual  with individual  
needs  and aspirations.
F. Consider  needs  of worker ’s wife and family.
G. The fundamental  long term problem  is that agricultural  workers  are 
finding  it increasingly  difficult  to identify  with the goals and objec ­
tives of the organisations  which employ  them. Until the worker  is 
able to modify  the goals and objectives  of the organisation  he will 
have no incentive  to put his best into the job.

Introduction
Mr. Chairman,  I wish to express  my thanks  to the trustees  for inviting  me 
to give this Seventh  Edward  Richards  - Orpen Memorial  lecture.
A National  Brucellosis  Eradication  scheme  was begun in Ireland  in 
1966. The position  in 1977 is that six counties  have been declared  free 
and eight counties  are undergoing  compulsory  blood  testing  in the clear ­
ance area. The remaining  12 counties  can avail of the Voluntary  Brucel ­
losis Pre-Intensive  scheme  which was designed  to prepare  the way for 
compulsory  measures.  Northern  Ireland  also has a Brucellosis  Eradica ­
tion programme  which was commenced  in 1964 and is nearing  comple ­
tion.
Ireland  is an island and there are strict controls  on the import  of 
livestock.  Therefore  the problem  is one from within  the country. The 
northern  half of the island  is almost  free of Brucellosis,  but has a popula ­
tion of susceptible  animals  while the southern  half has a high prevalence  
of the disease. In order to improve  this situation  immediate  steps must  
be taken  to reduce  the disease  prevalence  in the southern  counties  thereby  
removing  the source  of further  infections  in the cleared  areas.
The pressure  of eradication  must be maintained  and even accelerated  
to achieve  a successful  conclusion*'*.  All herdowners  must be informed  
about  the reasons  for following  the eradication  programme*^*.  Most of all 
we must strive for an understanding  of the disease.
History  of the disease
Brucellosis  is a disease  of animals  and man. It is caused  by highly  con­
tagious  Brucella  organisms.  Formerly,  the disease  in the bovine was 
called ‘contagious  abortion ’. This name accurately  described  the prin­
ciple symptoms  and acted as an immediate  warning  of the nature  of the 
disease.  As far back as 1807 “The Complete  Farmer ”, a journal  of the 
time, described  the contagious  nature  of the abortion  and the isolation  
procedures  which should  be undertaken.  However,  the cause of the dis­
ease was not identified  until 1887 when a British  doctor,  named  Bruce,  
and his wife isolated  an organism  from goats milk which  was being  sup­
89
plied to the British  forces  stationed  on the island  of Malta. Large num ­
bers of the troops  contracted  “Malta Fever ”, later to become  known  as 
Brucellosis.  Bruce stopped  the supply  of goat ’s milk and the incidence 
of new infections  dropped  dramatically.
In 1897 Bang and Stribolt  isolated  an organism  from aborting  cows  
which was able to reproduce  the disease  in healthy  stock. The causal  
organism  of “contagious  abortion ” was identified.  It was not until 1918 
that an American  bacteriologist  Alice  Evans  suggested  that the organisms  
described  by Bruce and Bang were very similar. This was subsequently  
proven  to be the case and the group  of organisms  was called Brucella  in 
honour  of Bruce  who first identified  them'^'.
Several  types are now recognised  the first being Brucella  melitensis  
which  caused  “Malta  Fever ” in man. Brucella  abortus  causes  contageous  
abortion  in cattle.  Brucella  ovis in sheep.  Brucella  suis in pigs and Bru­
cella canis is found in dogs. In Ireland  today only Brucella  abortus  is 
identified,  causing  abortion  in cattle and providing  the sole source of 
human  infection.
The disease
Brucellosis  in the bovine  exhibits  one principle  symptom,  i.e. abortion.  
The first abortion  can occur  once cows  reach  exactly  five months  pregnant.  
A majority  of the abortions  are seen around  the seventh  month. A cow 
will usually  abort  only once and then become  a “carrier ”. Some cows  may 
abort  a second  and occasionally  even a third time.
In the bovine,  infection  is usually  picked  up through  the mouth.  Occa ­
sionally  infection  may occur  through  cuts on the skin or by splashes  into 
the eye. This can be called  “direct  infection ”. If a positive  animal  calves  
or aborts unnoticed  and unrestricted,  pasture,  feed and drink may be 
contaminated  by the infected  discharges  of that animal. Cattle subse ­
quently  feeding  or drinking  the contaminated  material  could becorne  in­
fected. This can be called  “indirect  infection ”. A third pathway  of infec ­
tion is through  “latency ” where  a calf is infected  at birth or soon after and 
carries  the infection  through  to adult life.
Brucella  abortus  organisms  thrive and multiply  in the pregnant  ani­
mal. They only survive  for limited  periods  on pasture,  in sheds,  etc. The 
pregnant  infected  animal  therefore  can be regarded  as virtually  the source 
of infection.  All the discharges,  foetus  and placenta  passed  at an infected  
calving  or abortion  contain  millions  of brucella  organisms.  Over 90% 
of the total infection  is passed  at the actual  calving  or abortion.  There ­
fore such animals  must be placed under restriction  to prevent  further  
spread  of the disease.
Brucella  organisms  are easily killed by heat, drying  and the common  
disinfectants.  They survive  longer in the cold and could overwinter  if 
frozen. This is unlikely  to happen  under  Irish conditions.  The organisms  
will usually  die out within  two months  in sheds or growing  pasture  and 
within  three months  on land in winter.
The source  of the disease  and the time of spread  is known.  Therefore  
it should be possible  to initiate  management  procedures  to bring about  
its control.
90
Control  of Brucellosis
The key to controlling  the disease  is to “break the cycle ” of infection  
which  occurs  from year to year. The basic aim it to restrict  the positive  
cow and her infected  discharges  at calving  or abortion  and secondly  to 
maximise  within-herd  resistance  to the disease.  This can be achieved  by 
using simple  management  procedures  based on the following  principles.
The management  procedures  come under  five principle  headings :
(1) Identification
(2) Separation
(3) Calving  facilities
(4) Vaccination
(5) Disinfection
(1) Identification
There  are two main tests for identification  of brucellosis  positive  cows  
in Ireland.  The first, which is used in the Eradication  area, is the Blood  
Test. All blood  samples  are tested  at the National  Brucellosis  Laboratory,  
Dept, of Agriculture,  ‘Thorndale ’, Dublin  9. The positive  cows are ear- 
punched  and sent for immediate  slaughter  while the remainder  of the 
herd is put under movement  restriction  or ‘locked  up’ and re-tested  until 
clear.
The second  test which  is used in the Pre-Intensive  scheme  area is the 
Milk Ring Test. This is carried  out on bulk (churn)  milk samples  at the 
creamery  and on the individual  cows in positive  herds.  Under  this scheme, 
where cows are likely to be kept for a period,  positive  cows should  be 
marked  with an easily identifiable  coloured  ear tag. neck band or code 
number.  This will Indicate  the brucellosis  status  of the cows to anybody  
herding  the animals.
(2) Separation
The principle  method  of spread  of brucellosis  is by direct  contact  be­
tween negative  animals  and the infected  products  passed  at an infected 
calving  or abortion.  It is recommended  therefore  that once the positive 
cows are identified  plans should  be made to separate  the positive  and 
negative  cows. Ideally,  this should  be done as soon as pregnant  ariirnals  
reach  four and a half months  gestation.  This will eliminate  the possibility  
of direct  contact  between  positive  and negative  animals  should  an abor ­
tion occur unnoticed.  If separation  is not possible  at this time then the 
cows must be carefully  herded. A separation  may be possible  once the 
cows go dry. Positive  and negative  cows should  never be run together  at 
the same silage face.
In the spring  calving  herds a farmer  chooses  a date on which  to com­
mence  serving  his cows. He can then put a reminder  on his calendar  of 
the separation  date, four and a half months  later. In a herd where  cows  
have been calving  all the year round a farmer  can choose  two dates for 
commencement  of service,  one for his ‘spring ’ herd and one for his 
‘autumn ’ herd. He will then be in a position  to know the dates on which 
his cows will reach four and a half months  pregnant.
91
Under  the Eradication  Scheme  positive  cows should  be totally  isolated 
because  the remainder  of the herd are highly  susceptible  (non-vaccinated)  
cows. Under  the Pre-Intensive  scheme,  vaccination  with the killed  45/20  
adjuvant  vaccine  (K45/20A)  is widely practised,  earnestly  encouraged  
and is mandatory  for replacement  heifers. With these animals  separation  
can be effective  with as little as an electric  fence. However,  the best 
separation  possible  should  be used on each farm. Positive  cows could be 
grazed  on separate  land or on the paddock  behind  the grazing  rotation.  
Separate  wintering  arrangements  must be made to avoid putting  positive 
and negative  cows together  at the silage  face.
Herding.  The times  at which  Brucella  abortions  may occur  have been 
pointed  out. There  are definite  signs to be seen pre-abortion.  The prin­
ciple signs are : (1) sudden  springing  of the udder,  (2) slime at the vulva 
or on the hind quarters,  (3) dropped  pin bones (raised  tailhead),  (4) un­
usual uneasiness.  Pregnant  animals  showing  any of these signs should  be 
isolated  until they either abort or settle down. The important  point in 
herding  pregnant  animals  is to inspect  the hind quarters.  This should  be 
done twice a day.
(3) Calving  facility
The first requirement  in a brucellosis  positive  herd is that a separate  
calving  facility  be provided  for positive  and negative  animals. These  
facilities  should be sited carefully  away from the main farm road and 
with safe drainage,  preferably  into a separate  soak pit. It is also essential  
that there should  be no contact  between  positive  and negative  units either  
directly  or via the drainage.
A calving  facility  can be any of the following :
(a) Individual  calving  box
(b) Tie up shed
(c) Calving  shed
(d) Loose  house
(e) Small  field or paddock
(a) The individual  calving  box is ideal. All of the discharges  passed  
at the calving  or abortion  will be restricted  and the box can be easily 
cleaned  and disinfected.  Even where individual  boxes are available  a 
certain  number  should  be allotted  to the positive  cows and only positive 
cows should  be calved  in them. These would be the boxes next to the 
drainage  outlet.
Many buildings  have become  redundant  due to changes  in manage ­
ment, i.e. self feed layout. These buildings  could be converted  into calv­
ing boxes  to reduce  the overall  cost, provided  they are suitably  sited and 
drained.
(b) The tie up shed or cow byre is a very good system  for confining 
the pregnant  and calving  cow. The positive  cows should  be tied together,  
next to the drainage  outlet and by expected  calving  date. The negative  
cows can be tied in the shed with an empty standing  between  the two 
groups. The negative  cows should also be tied according  to expected  
calving  date. This will avoid the possibility  of cows in mid or early preg­
nancy  becoming  infected  and having  an abortion.
92
(c) A calving  shed which is divided  by gates into boxes  can be used 
for one or other group. Sheeting  the gates with galvanised  iron or hard-  
board  would  be a useful  addition.
(d) A small field or paddock  could be used for either  group. This 
paddock  should  not be grazed  for three months  following  the last calving.
Any of the above  facilities  or any combination  of them may be used 
successfully.
Note : The best facility  should  always  be used for the negative  cows  
in case one is incubating  the disease  and has not been identified  as in­
fected. This will help to minimise  or eliminate  further  spread  of infection.
(4) Vaccination
In the case of brucellosis  only a dead vaccine  has been used in Ireland  
since 1968. This is called  the killed strain  45/20  adjuvant  vaccine  (K45/  
20A). The aim of any vaccination  programme  is to prevent  infection  tak­
ing place. Therefore  the vaccine  should be given before animals  are 
exposed  to infection.  Vaccination  of heifers  against  brucellosis  should  
be carried  out when they reach 12 months  of age. A primary  (essential) 
course of vaccination  comprises  two inoculations  given 6 to 12 weeks 
apart. This should  be completed  before  the heifers  are served.  In infected 
herds,  with abortions  occurring  each year, booster  vaccination  should  be 
given annually.  In herds without  infection  booster  vaccination  can be 
given every 18 months  or two years. This vaccination  should  be given 
when cows are non-pregnant  so as to try and prevent  infection  taking  
place.
It is now widely  accepted  that some of the cells in the immune  system 
of the animal  which  are sensitised  by vaccination  can live for 10 years or 
more. Therefore  the protective  effect of brucellosis  vaccination  can be 
expected  to reduce,  slowly,  over a number  of years.
(5) Disinfection
Brucella  organisms  are quite easily killed by disinfection.  Disinfec ­
tants should  be made  up according  to the manufacturer ’s specification  and 
renewed  regularly.  The Department  of Agriculture  publishes  a list of 
approved  disinfectants  for various  diseases,  including  brucellosis,  and 
gives the dilution  rates at which  they should  be used.
A foot dip (basin,  bucket,  small trough,  etc.) should  be placed  outside  
each calving  facility.  Boots  should  be dipped  going  in and coming  out of 
each area. All the bedding  from the calving  facilities  should  be sprayed  
with disinfectant  (sprayer,  sprinkling  can, etc.) before  removal  and stacked  
separately.  Calving  boxes, especially  those used for the negative  cows,  
should  be cleaned  out and disinfected  between  calvings.
When  an abortion  or calving  occurs  amongst  a group  of animals,  the 
cows should  be removed  immediately  and the area thoroughly  disinfected.  
If this occurs  while grazing,  the herd should  be moved  on to the next 
paddock.
Note : Once steps have been taken to control  the disease  within  the 
herd extra attention  should  be paid to the farm fencing  to ensure  that it 
remains  stockproof.
93
Brucellosis  control  programme  at Moorepark
A brucellosis  control  programme,  based  on the principles  already  dis­
cussed,  was introduced  to the six dairy herds  of the Moorepark  centre  and 
field stations  in the autumn  of 1974. All six farms  were accepted  into the 
Pre-Intensive  Scheme. The overall brucellosis  prevalence  was 20.9%,  
varying  between  herds from 12.8% to 28.9%  positive. Herd size ranged  
from 130 to 250 cows. The total number  of cows tested in 1974 was 990.
(1) Identification
Routine  blood and milk samples  were collected  simultaneously  from 
each individual  cow once the whole herd had calved  down. The milk 
ring test was repeated  six weeks later while all the cows were still in 
lactation.  The blood test was repeated  when the cows were in mid preg­
nancy. All the positive  cows were marked  with a white tag in the left 
ear.
(2) Separation
Due to other on-going  experiments  it was not possible  to separate  
cows from the middle  of the fourth month of gestation. However,  a 
reminder  was put on the calendar  to commence  careful  herding  of the 
cows from this time onwards.  In general  the positive  cows were separated  
once they went dry or as they came  off experiment.  In Herd E and a small 
group in Herd A, there was no separation  of the positive  cows. They 
remained  in their experimental  groups  for grazing  and on silage,  but were 
removed  for calving.
The positive  cows returned  to the milking  herd seven  days after they 
passed  the afterbirth,  provided  there was no obvious  discharge  from the 
vagina. Until this time the positive  cows were milked  last.
(3) Calving  facilities
The calving  facilities  were arranged  to keep the best facilities  on each 
farm for the negative  cows.
In Herd A, two four-pen  calving  sheds  were used for calving  the nega ­
tive cows. The positive  cows were tied in individual  feeding  stalls and 
calved  in a pen at the end of the row. The late calving  positive  cows were 
calved  in the lower  of the two calving  sheds.
In Herd B the negative  cows were calved  in a loose house  divided  into 
two pens while the positives  were calved  in two small paddocks.
In Herd C the negative  cows were calved in six individual  calving 
sheds  while  the positive  cows were calved  in an old cow byre.
In Herd D the negative  cows were calved  in a large shed divided  into 
six boxes,  two at each side opening  into two in the centre. The positive 
cows were calved  in a small  paddock  where  an L-shaped  galvanised  wind ­
break  was provided.
In Herd E the negative  cows were calved  in a four pen calving  shed 
while the positives  were calved  in a loose house.
In Herd F in 1974 the autumn  calving  cows calved  in a paddock  mixed 
together  before  the management  programme  began. Subsequently  positive 
and negative  cows were calved  in individual  boxes.
94
(4) Vaccination
All cows  were booster  vaccinated  annually  in the spring  until the posi­
tive cows had been removed  from the herd. Biennially  vaccination  will 
be continued  in these herds. The replacement  heifers  were vaccinated  as 
yearlings  before  being  served. They  were blood  tested  subsequently  when  
2 - 3 months  pregnant.  The ‘latent  carrier ’ would  appear  to give a positive  
result  at this stage. Such heifers  were then placed  under  restriction.
(5) Disinfection
The disinfectant  used in 1974 was “Chloros ” while “Jeyes Fluid ” has 
been used since then in all the herds. Any of the other approved  disin ­
fectants  could  also be used. Garden  sprayers  were used in 1974, 1975 for 
spraying  disinfectant  onto bedding,  cow ’s hind quarters,  etc., but were 
somewhat  fragile  and tended  to corrode.  Sprinkling  cans are now used.
The results  from the six individual  farms  are given in Table 1. Certain  
changes  in farm size and animal  numbers  occurred  which  are explained  
in the following  way. Herd A received  the majority  of both spring  and 
autumn  calving  cows from Herd F in winter  1974 and spring 1975. Some  
positive  cows were also brought  in to facilitate  the clearance  of brucellosis  
from other herds, i.e. Herd C, Herd D, Herd E and Herd F. All move ­
ments of animals  was carried  out under permit  from the Department  of 
Agriculture.
Herd C was reduced  in size due to reduction  in farm acreage.  Herd D 
was transferred  to a new farm in Spring 1977 following  the sale of all 
known  positive  cows. Herd E was reduced  in size due to reseeding  of 
half the farm. Herd F was made up of 92 heifers  which calved  as two- 
year-olds  in 1976 and the number  was increased  to 138 following  the in­
troduction  of 50 three-year-old  heifers  in 1977.
The important  features  to note in the results  are the very small number  
of new positive  cows which were identified  each year indicating  that the 
spread of the disease had been brought  under control  in each herd. 
Gradual  elimination  of positive  cows from the various  herds have left 
four herds free in summer  1977. The three positive  cows in Herd D were 
sold off. Extra replacements  have been reared and it is hoped to milk 
out the positive  cows in the remaining  two herds in 1978 and not put 
them back in calf. The new positive  cows in 1976 and 1977 are almost  
entirely  second  calvers.
The other  feature  of the results  is the high number  of positive  replace ­
ment heifers  which  were introduced  up to 1976. This problem  has been 
overcome  by the blood test which is carried  out on the heifers  at 2 - 3 
months  pregnant  as previously  described.  The three new heifers  in Herd  
D in 1977 had been exposed  subsequent  to testing.
The difficulties  experienced  at the beginning  of the control  procedures  
were: (1) the abortion  at the end of five months  gestation,  (2) the occa ­
sional very quick premature  calving  between  8 - 9 months  gestation  and 
(3) heifers  drinking  from contaminated  water supplies  (river  and stream).  
These  problems  were dealt with by putting  a reminder  for herding  on the 
calendar,  careful  and regular  observation  of heavily  pregnant  cows and 
by providing  piped  drinking  water  for the paddocks  concerned.

The overall  culling  rate was approximately  20% and was non selec­
tive for brucellosis  positive  cows.
Milk Ring Test
In order to monitor  the Milk Ring Test (MRT)  results,  simultaneous  
blood samples  were collected  from all cows. A comparison  of the Milk  
Ring Test results  with the Blood  Serum  Agglutination  test (SAT)  results 
are shown  in Tables  2 and 3. Of the 146 cows which  were positive  to the 
MRT as interpreted  under the Brucellosis  Pre-Intensive  Scheme,  96% 
had a simultaneous  SAT positive  result  (Table  2). Much  of the difference  
between  these two figures  is bridged  by looking  at the results  in Table  
4 which show that any cow giving  a reading  of 2+ (50% agglutination)  
or greater  on the neat milk has more than an 88% chance  of being  SAT 
positive.
96
These  results  show that the MRT  as interpreted  under  the Brucellosis  
Pre-Intensive  Scheme  is identifying  positive  animals  with very few excep ­
tions, i.e. where  there is a false positive  result. They also show a propor ­
tion of suspect  reactions  which  indicate  that these cows should,  at least,  
be resampled  while still in mid lactation.  The disease  is dynamic  not 
static. New cows may have become  infected  and it can take some time 
for these animals  to give a positive  result. Again,  there is the need for 
resampling.  As approximately  90% of cows become  infected  in the 
udder<5. ’) it would  appear  appropriate  that a blood test be carried  out, 
following  disposal  of the MRT  positive  cows, to finalise  accreditation  of 
the herd.
All tests were carried  out using  antigens  to E.E.C./W.H.O.  standards^*)  
supplied  by the Brucellosis  Laboratory,  Department  of Agriculture,  
‘Thorndale ’, Dublin  9.

The ‘latent carrier ’ heifers  appeared  to be identified  by a blood test, 
as described  earlier,  carried  out after vaccination  and service  but before 
they reached  five months  gestation,  i.e. at 2 - 3 months  pregnant.  The 
figures  for 1976 - 11 (Table  5) show that the four positive  heifers  represent  
approximately  1% and come from positive  herds rather than just from 
positive  dams. Once these heifers  are identified  they must be removed 
and placed  under  restriction.  The remaining  heifers  should  still be herded  
carefully  in case of subsequent  exposure.  It is the early unnoticed  abor ­
tion amongst  a group  of heifers  which can lead to a high number  of in­
fected  replacement  animals.

Discussion
The results  obtained  over three years in Moorepark  using basic man­
agement  techniques  in the control  of Brucellosis  suggest  that such pro­
cedures  will give a satisfactory  outcome  for the extra amount  of thought  
and effort required  to operate  them. Control  is not 100 per cent but it so 
radically  slows down the spread of the disease  that by selling off the 
known  positive  animals  the source  of spread  within  the herd is eliminated.  
Thus your problem  is reduced  to a minimum  at which  stage eradication  
is very possible.
The approach  to be adopted  is very straightforward.  The extent  of the 
problem  must be discovered  by testing the herd and the within herd 
resistance  must be maximised  by vaccination.  Then,  the farmer  can de­
cide, with the help of his Veterinary  and Agricultural  advisers,  how he 
can handle  the separation  and calving  of positive  and negative  cows on 
his farm. All a herdowner  can do is to use the facilities  which  are already  
available  on the farm. He should  plan and organise  for any necessary 
improvements  and herd the pregnant  animals  carefully  at the appropriate  
times.
A knowledge  of the disease  pattern,  which  is very consistent,  gives the 
farmer  the opportunity  to intervene  at the appropriate  time and ‘break  the 
cycle ’ of the infection,  thereby  bringing  Brucellosis  under  control.  Once 
he can control  the disease  he can plan a culling  and replacement  pro­
gramme  to eliminate  the disease  as quickly  as is economically  possible. 
Three  years should  be the maximum  timescale  for any herd.
The Pre-Intensive  Brucellosis  Scheme  has been in operation  since 1973 
based  on the Milk Ring Testing  (MRT)  of bulk milk at the creamery  and
98
the individual  cows in positive  herds. The aim of this Pre-Intensive  or 
Pre-Eradication  Scheme  is to reduce  the pool of infection  in advance  of 
the compulsory  blood test and slaughter  policy. It has not suceeded  in 
its aim despite  the supportive  intervention  of the major Co-Operatives.  
Therefore  we find ourselves  in the position  that most of the 12 counties  
in the non-eradication  area still have too high a prevalence  of the disease.
One half of the country  has very little brucellosis  and the other half 
has a high prevalence.  It is unrealistic  to expect  that further  progress  can 
be made in the Eradication  areas while the remainder  of the country  has 
such high infection  levels. We must concentrate  and accelerate  our efforts  
in the southern  counties  in order to reduce  the source  of spread  of the 
disease.  What I would  suggest,  keeping  in mind the ability  to control  the 
disease  and the time necessary  for the economic  removal  and replacement  
of positive  animals,  is a three year Compulsory  Pre-Intensive  Scheme,  to 
be followed  immediately  by compulsory  blood test and slaughter.
During  the three year period  dairy herds would  continue  to be MRT  
tested  along  the lines I have suggested  and the beef herds  could be tested  
by an accurate,  rapid and cheap  screening  blood  test. All positive  animals  
would be punched  and their identity  cards collected.  Bonuses,  as now,  
would  be paid on slaughter  of these animals.  A clear blood  test would  be 
the accredtiation  test for all herds.
This would  mean that as many positive  animals  as possible  would  be 
identified  quickly  and their access  to the open market  restricted.  It would 
give time for the rearing  of extra replacements  to maintain  stock  numbers  
and positive  cows could be milked  out and culled  at the end of lactation.  
The use of the brucellosis  vaccine  (K45/20A)  would  continue  and should  
be greatly  encouraged  over this period  to boost  within  herd resistance.
Brucellosis  is dynamic  not static. We must keep the pressure  on to 
reduce  the disease  prevalence.  This point is emphasised  by Hugh-Jones  
in his recent “Evaluation  of Brucellosis  Eradication  in England  and 
Wales” <^>. He also emphasised  the need for the constant  review  of eradi ­
cation  policy. We have a very good series  of tests available  which  can be 
strategically  applied  to the problems  of the individual  herd. All we need 
is the will to do the job and the confidence  that we will be successful.

SWARD  PROCESSES  UNDER  GRAZING  
A. J. BRERETON
The Agricultural  Institute,  Johnstown  Castle,  Wexford.
A grazed  perennial  ryegrass  (S24) sward  was analysed  in detail  during  
13 months  from 1st February  1977 until late Marsh  1978. In the analyses, 
emphasis  is being placed  on the identification  and quantification  of the 
factors  affecting  daily grass growth  rate during  the rest period. The fac­
tors considered  are (a' climate,  (b) physiological  and (c) management.  
The climatically  determined  growth  rates were calculated  using relation ­
ships obtained  from published  work. Both temperature  and radiation  
markedly  depressed  growth rate before May and after September. 
Drought  depressed  growth  rates during  July and August.  The climatic ­
ally determined  rates were compared  with observed  growth  rates. The 
results  show that the calculated  growth  rate overestimates  growth  rate in 
the May-June  period  by a factor  of about  two and underestimates  growth  
rates at the end of the season  (September-October)  by a factor  of about  
two. This discrepancy  between  calculated  and observed  growth  rates is 
attributed  to the effect of flowering  which is averaged  over the season  in 
the calculated  data. The results  indicate  that the growth  rate of a repro ­
ductive  sward is three to four times as great as the growth  rate of a 
vegetative  sward. The difference  in growth  rate between  reproductive  
and vegetative  swards  was largely  due to the difference  in leaf net assim ­
ilation  rate. The difference  in leaf net assimilation  rate was only partly  
accounted  for by differences  in solar radiation  receipt.

GRASS  PRODUCTION  AND EARLY  FAT LAMB  PERFORM ­
ANCE  ON SOD SEEDED  OLD PASTURES  AT BELCLARE
E. GRENNAN
The Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
The climate  in the west of Ireland  is favourable  for the production  of 
early grass but this potential  is difficult  to exploit  where  old permanent  
pastures  predominate.  If early growing  grasses  are established  in old 
pastures  by the “stitching-in ” technique,  they could  considerably  improve  
the potential  for early grass growth.
RVP Italian ryegrass  was successfully  stitched  into old pastures  in 
1974. Pastures  were grazed  bare, sprayed  with gramoxone  at 700 ccs/ 
hectare  and RVP sown with a Bettinson  3D, (17.8 cm spacing)  at 19 
kg seed/ha  in mid-July  or early September.  A sowing  was also made  
after a silage cut in early September,  without  using gramoxone.
Establishment  of Italian  ryegrass  was satisfactory  on each site, though  
somewhat  better  on grazed  and sprayed  sites than after silage. Spraying  
pastures  in early September  reduced  autumn  growth  by about 600 kg 
D.M./ha.
Yields were measured  in 1975 and 1976 in a simulated  three cut 
silage system  on plots receiving  0, 50 or 100 kg N/ha  for each cut. Total  
yields  were highest  on stitched  in plots,  the difference  being  about  900 to 
1,500 kg/ha or 12 to 15 per cent. The benefit  of Italian  ryegrass  was 
most noticeable  in spring  and in pasture  recovery  after cutting,  especially  
during  dry periods.
Old and stitched-in  pastures  were grazed  with an early lambing  ewe 
flock from late February  through  April and stocked  at 7.5, 12.5 or 17.5 
ewes plus lambs per hectare. The extra grass on stitched-in  paddocks  
was reflected  in improved  liveweight  gain in lambs,  at all stocking  rates  
in 1975 and at the low and high stocking  rates in 1976.
The response  to stitching-in  Italian  ryegrass  looks promising,  but the 
management  of Italian  in an old pasture  in relation  to dates  of silage  cuts 
needs attention.

THE DIGESTIBLE  AND METABOLISABLE  ENERGY  OF 
GRASS  JUICE  FOR GROWING  PIGS
O. CARTON  and M. F. MAGUIRE  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
The mechanical  pulping  and squeezing  of high moisture  forage  crops  
produces  a protein  rich juice and an ensilable  high dry matter crop 
residue.  The juice contains  6-10%  dry matter  of which  30-35%  is crude  
protein  having 6.5% lysine. For grass crops harvested  at four week 
intervals  throughout  the season  the juice extract  contains  approximately  
30% of the total dry matter  production  and 45% of the crude protein.
A digestibility  trial was conducted  to establish  the digestible  energy 
(DE) and metabolisable  energy  (ME)  of grass  juice for growing  pigs. The 
grass juice was prepared  from a late autumn  cut of a tetraploid  ryegrass. 
The juice,  concentrated  to 11% DM (4.2% CP, 2.6% ash) and preserved 
with HCl and Sodium  Metabisulphite,  was used to replace  30% of the 
organic  matter  in a barley-soyabean  ration  fed in the preliminary  period.  
Five pigs of initial  weight  37-39  kg were used in metabolism  crates.
The basal diet had dry matter  digestibility  (DMD)  and organic  matter  
digestibility  (OMD)  values  of 82.1 and 89.5%  respectively.  The digestibil ­
ity of grass juice  dry matter  and organic  matter  (calculated  by difference) 
was 69.9 and 90.9% respectively.  The determined  DE and ME values  
for grass juice on a dry matter  basis were 9.89 MJ/kg  and 8.17 MJ/kg.  
The corresponding  values  on an ash-free  basis were 12.68 MJ/kg  and 
10.51 MJ/kg.

SILAGE  EFFLUENT  AS A SOURCE  OF NUTRIENTS  FOR  
THE GROWING  PIG
D. C. PATTERSON  and N. WALKER
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of Northern  Ireland.  Hillsborough.
Co. Down.
In preliminary  studies  effluent  was readily  consumed  by the pig with­
out toxic effects. In two subsequent  exfieriments  littermate  pairs of pigs 
were individually-fed  either  a meal plus water  control  diet or an effluent 
containing  diet in which silage effluent  formed  150 g/kg of dry matter  
fed. All pigs were fed to a scale based  on metabolic  body weight.
In the first experiment,  freshly  collected  effluent  from two sources  was 
offered  over a liveweight  range  of 64 to 85 kg. The daily gains  were 719, 
715 and 753 ± 16.8 g and feed : gain ratios were 3.07, 3.10 and 2.94 
± 0.075 g for the control  and two effluent  treatments  respectively.  In the 
seeond  experiment  effluent  was stored  for 3.5, 14, 28, 56, 112 or 240 days 
before  being  given  to pigs. Initial  and final liveweights  were 33 and 83 kg 
respectively.  Littermate  pairs of pigs were allocated  to a stored  effluent 
treatment  and a contemporary  control  treatment  as the stored effluents 
were not available  for testing  simultaneously.  The use of contemporary  
control  treatments  permitted  adjustment  of means  for differences  in time. 
The overall  mean daily gains on the effluent  and control  diets were 646 
and 655 ± 7.5 *g respectively.  For the same comparison  the mean  feed : 
gain ratios  (DM basis)  were 2.69 and 2.64 ±0.03 *g and subcutaneous  fat 
contents  of the rump back joint were 271 and 279 ± 5.6 *g/kg  respec ­
tively. None of these differences  were significant.  Pig performance  did 
not deteriorate  with increasing  period  of effluent  storage.
An experiment  is currently  in progress  in which  the performance  of 
pigs given an all-meal  or effluent  containing  diet is being compared  in 
both individual  and group-penning  situations.  Results  to date indicate  
that performance  on the diet containing  silage effluent  is as good as on 
the all-meal  diet in both cases.
The experimental  work to date has shown  that effluent  can replace  
150 g/kg of the dry matter  of the finisher  diet of bacon  pigs resulting  in 
a substantial  saving  in feed costs.

LABORATORY  STUDIES  ON GRASS  SILAGE
R. K. WILSON,  A. V. FLYNN  and D. COLLINS  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
About  25% of farm silages  in this country  are poorly  preserved  with 
pH values of 4.7 or greater^ In an attempt  to explain  this result the 
effects  of nitrogen  fertiliser,  wilting,  grass genera  and ensilage  technique  
on silage fermentation  were examined  in laboratory  silos.
In three experiments,  application  of N seven  weeks  before  cutting  had 
little effect on silage quality.  Wilting  was unreliable.
Grass genus had a very significant  effect. It was jTOssible  to rank 
grasses for silage making  as follows : ryegrass,  good; old permanent  
pasture,  timothy,  tall fescue,  bent grass, red fescue,  moderate;  yorkshire  
fog and cocksfoot,  poor.
Speed of filling had a large effect and slow filling,  accompanied  by 
heating  may account  for much poor silage.
Results  for 800 silages relating  grass, water soluble carbohydrate  
(WSC)  and silage pH are tabulated  and suggest  that a WSC level of 14% 
of DM (3% in juice) is required.
Physical  chemistry  calculations  show that pH in silage is largely  the 
result of interaction  of lactic acid and ammonia.

FEED FACTORS  AFFECTING  INTAKE  AND BEEF  
PRODUCTION  BY SILAGE  FED CATTLE
V. FLYNN
The Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
While it has for long been recognised  that digestibility  is the major  
factor  determining  intake and animal  production  potential  of dried for­
ages, this relationship  has been less well defined  for silages.  The apparent  
inconsistency  in the relationship  for silages has to some extent been 
attributed  to the nature  of the ensiling  fermentation  and to a depressing  
effect of extensive  fermentation  on silage intake. Consequently  it has 
often been considered  desirable  to increase  the dry matter  content  of 
herbage  by wilting  before ensiling  in order to restrict  the fermentation  
and raise the feeding  value of the silage.
Analyses  of the results  of Grange  feeding  trials in which  40 different  
but well preserved  silages  were fed show a clear relationship  between 
dry matter  digestibility  (DMD)  and production  by 400-500  kg beef cattle.  
DMD values  of 61%, 66%, 69% and 74% have been associated  with 
daily  liveweight  gains of 250 g, 470 g, 670 g and 860 g respectively.  Daily  
carcase  gain has been 560 g on several  of the silages  in the 74% DMD  
class. It must be noted that production  on 74% DMD silage is close to 
that expected  on similar  cattle over an entire grazing  season. This sug­
gests that proper  ensiling  may have little or no effect on the production  
potential  of herbage.
The results  of several  trials comparing  forages  differing  in dry matter  
content  have shown no beef production  advantage  in favour  of higher  
dry matter  forage.
An attempt  was therefore  made to quantify  the effects  of dry matter  
content  and of ensiling  per se on the intake and production  potential  of 
herbage.  During  summer  1977 two groups  of 10 cattle were fed either  
fresh grass or grass wilted for 24 hours. The trial was continued  for 15 
weeks. In the middle  of each week fresh and wilted grass, represen ­
tative of the herbage  fed in that week,  was ensiled. The silages  were fed 
in sequence  after four months  storage  to two groups  of 10 cattle. Similar 
animals  (initial  liveweight  435 kg) were used for grass and silage  parts of 
the experiment.  The mean daily dry matter intakes  of unwilted  and 
wilted grass and silage were 1.98, 1.90, 1.86 and 1.89% of mean live- 
weight. The corresponding  daily carcase  gains were 420 g, 430 g, 430 g 
and 370 g.
These results indicate  that a well preserved  silage can support  the 
same level of beef production  as the grass from which  it is derived  and 
that dry matter  content  per se does not raise the beef production  poten ­
tial of forage.

EFFECTS  OF CARBOHYDRATE  AND  NITROGEN  SUPPLEMEN ­
TATION  ON THE INTAKE  AND UTILIZATION  OF SILAGE  BY
SHEEP
R. W. MAYES,  E. WALSH  and J. L. L'ESTRANGE
Department  of Agricultural  Chemistry,  University  College,  Glasnevin,
Dublin  9.
The efficiency  with which nitrogen  (N) in silage is utilized  may be 
restricted  by degradation  of herbage  protein  to non-protein  nitrogen  
(NPN)  during  ensilage.  In addition,  fermentation  of soluble  carbohyd ­
rate during  ensilage  may limit the energy  available  for ruminal  microbial  
protein  synthesis.
The effect upon animal  performance  of feeding  grass silage alone or 
supplemented  with protein  (casein,  17.1g/kg  fresh silage),  NPN (urea,  
4.56g/kg)  or soluble  carbohydrate  (sucrose  20.6g/kg)  was studied  using  
12 store wether  lambs  in a triple 4x4 Latin Square  experiment.  Para ­
meters measured  included  voluntary  intake, rumen fermentation  and 
blood metabolites.  Eight  of the sheep  were kept in metabolism  cages  for 
digestibility  and balance  studies.  Each period  lasted  21 days with excreta  
being collected  over the final 10 days.
The silage used was of good quality  as indicated  by its composition  
and the performance  of animals  when receiving  silage alone. The effects  
of supplementary  casein  and urea were similar;  DM intake  was depressed  
by 12-13%  and the animals  lost weight,  whilst  levels  of rumen  NH. and 
serum urea, intake and urinary  excretion  of N were raised. Supplemen ­
tary sucrose  did not significantly  affect intake or liveweight  gain but 
reduced  rumen  pH and raised blood glucose  levels. Dry matter  digesti ­
bility, blood pH and N retention  were not significantly  affected  by 
treatment.

THE EFFECTS  OF CEREAL  PROCESSING  AND OF ZINC  
SUPPLEMENTATION  ON THE PERFORMANCE  OF LAMBS
J. L. L’ESTRANGE
Department  of Agriculturai  Chemistry,  University  College,  Glasnevin,
Dublin  9.
A factorial  design  experiment  was carried  out with 42 early weaned 
lambs fed barley based concentrate  ration in which the barley  was fed 
either whole or loose, ground  and loose or ground  and pelleted  after  
mixing  with other ingredients.  In addition,  with each main plot treatment  
the effect of a high level of zinc supplementation  (400 ppm) was com­
pared with a low level (34 ppm) in relation  to the protective  effect of 
zinc against  copper  toxicity.
Live-weight  gain was similar  for the three barley treatments  at ap­
proximately  320 g/day,  but the food conversion  ratio was significantly  
better  on the whole  barley  treatment.  This treatment  resulted  in a higher  
ratio of acetic  to propionic  acid in rumen  fluid of the lambs  accompanied  
by a higher  pH. There  was no appreciable  effect of barley  treatment  on 
the melting  point  or fatty acid composition  of subcutaneous  or perineph ­
ric fat of the lambs.
Copper  toxicity  did not occur on any treatments  but the storage  of 
copper  in liver was considerably  reduced  by the high zinc supplementa ­
tion. Copper  storage  in liver was higher on the pelleted  than on the 
unpelleted  diets. The high zinc supplementation  improved  food intake  
and live-weight  gain of the lambs. It did not affect the pH or volatile  
fatty acids in the rumen  fluid or the melting  point and fatty acid com­
position  of the carcass  fat.

REPLACEMENT  OF CONCENTRATES  WITH ROOTS  IN THE  
DIET OF EARLY  WEANED  LAMBS
S. FITZGERALD
The Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuani,  Co. Galway.
In a system  of accelerated  lamb production,  i.e. three lamb crops in 
two years, the lambs are weaned  at 5-6 wks. of age and subsequently  
reared  on a concentrate  diet. To reduce  feed costs,  two experiments  have 
been carried  out to determine  the extent that concentrates  can be re­
placed with pulped  roots in the diet of such lambs. The lambs were  
introduced  to concentrates  as a creep  feed at three weeks  of age, weaned  
onto concentrates  at 5-6 weeks and after a transitional  period of 7-10 
days were allocated  to diets in which concentrates  were replaced  by 
varying  proportions  of roots. The roots were supplemented  with soya 
bean meal to provide  16% crude protein  in the dietary  dry matter  (DM),  
similar  to the concentrate  diet, with minerals  plus vitamins  added. The 
lambs  were slaughtered  at 38 kg liveweight.
In Trial 1, the proportion  of concentrates  fed in the diet from wean ­
ing until slaughter  was 100, 75, 50 and 25% of the total DM intake.  
Intake  of concentrates  in the mixed  diets was either  restricted  or reduced  
gradually,  with roots fed to appetite.  The roots fed consisted  of a high 
DM fodder  beet variety  Monorosa  (19% DM).
In Trial 2, the proportion  of concentrates  fed was 100, 50, 25 or 5% 
of total intake. In this case a low DM root, yellow  globe mangel  (10%  
DM) was used.
Daily  liveweight  gains in Trial 1 were 284, 263, 278 and 262 g/day  on 
the diets containing  100 to 25% concentrates,  respectively.  Replacing  con­
centrates  with a high proportion  of roots (75%)  increased  days on trial 
(90 to 96 days) increased  daily DM intake/lamb  (937 to 990 g) and total 
DM intake  (86 v 98 kg/lamb)  and resulted  in an increase  in feed conver ­
sion ratio from 3.33 to 3.80 kg DM/kg  lamb gain.
In Trial 2, daily liveweight  gains were 272, 273, 265 and 260 g/day  
for diets containing  100 to 5% concentrates  respectively.  As in Trial 1, 
replacing  concentrates  with a high proportion  of roots supplemented  with 
protein  and minerals  (95%)  resulted  in a longer  fattening  period (89 v 
97 days), a higher  daily DM intake (876 v 985 g/lamb/day)  and total 
intake  (78 v 96 kg/lamb)  and an increased  feed conversion  ratio (3.31 v 
3.82 kg DM/kg  Iwt. gain). There were no differences  between  diets in 
carcass  weight,  killing  out % or gut contents  in either  trial.
The results indicate  that pulped roots, supplemented  with protein,  
minerals  and vitamins,  can substantially  replace  concentrates  in the diet 
of early weaned  lambs  at approximately  half of the cost, resulting  in only 
slight reduction  in lamb growth  rates but with an increase  in feed con­
version  rate due to the higher  DM intakes  of roots. Lambs  were able to 
consume  large amounts  of roots  even of a low DM content  at a relatively  
young age. Assuming  that the soya bean meal supplement  used was 
equivalent  to the concentrate  diet in energy  value,  then 1 kg concentrate  
DM was equivalent  to 1.2 kg root DM in terms of feed conversion  
efficiency  to liveweight  gain.

THE RELATIVE  EEFICIENCY  OF FOOD UTILIZATION  BY 
FRIESIAN  BULLS  AND STEERS

A combined  nutritional  balance  and comparative  slaughter  trial using  
20 animals  compared  Friesian  male (E) and castrate  male (C) cattle  when 
pair fed at two planes  of nutrition  (M and H) over the liveweight  (LW) 
range 130-400  kg. Animals  were placed  on nutritional  balance  on four 
occasions  during  the period. Liveweight  gains for each treatment  were 
(kg/day) : EH 1.10, EM 0.91, CH 0.93, CM 0.79. There were no sig­
nificant  differences  between  the digestive  efficiency  of bulls and steers.
Preliminary  results  for the carcass  data showed  that the bulls pro­
duced slightly  more lean meat and less fat than the steers. Chemical  
analysis  of the edible  portion  of the carcass  showed  that bulls deposited  
more protein  and significanlty  less fat. Daily carcass  protein  gain was 
significantly  higher  for the bulls but daily carcass  energy  gain was not 
significantly  different.

THE GENETIC  IMPROVEMENT  OF LOWLAND  SHEEP  
J. P. HANRAHAN
The Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
The lowland  ewe population  in this country  consists  of purebred  ewes  
of lowland  breeds  (mainly  the Galway  breed)  and ewes derived  from the 
hill breeds (Blackface  Mountain  and Cheviot).  Since hill breeds con­
tribute  to the lowland  population,  their role must be examined  when  
considering  the genetic  improvement  of this population.  It is well estab ­
lished  that biological  efficiency  and economic  efficiency  are both strongly  
influenced  by variations  in the number  of lambs reared  per ewe. That  
this aspect  of our lowland  sheep  population  needs  to be improved  is clear  
when our ewe flock performance  is compared  with that of the United  
Kingdom  and N. Ireland. The following  results  emerge  when the per­
formance  of lowland  spring  lambing  flocks  is examined  :
No. of lambs  reared  per ewe to the ram
U.K.  — 1.43
N. Ireland  — 1.35
Ireland  — 1.20
Our level of output  per ewe is 20% below  that in the U.K. From  the 
results of ewe breed comparisons  in Ireland  and the U.K., it can be 
concluded  that most of the difference  between  the two countries  is due 
to the genetic  limitations  of our main lowland  breed —the Galway.
A long term selection  experiment  for increased  litter size has been 
underway  in a Galway  flock since 1964 and to-date  a response  of 15% 
has been achieved.  However,  while  this shows  that within  breed selection 
can increase  litter size, the rate of improvement,  when  viewed  against  the 
required  improvement  in the national  flock, is such that this approach  
is not likely  to generate  appreciable  change  in the national  Galway  flock  
before  the end of the present  century.  Consequently,  immediate  improve ­
ment of the Galway  breed  must be pursued  through  crossing  to introduce  
genes for increased  prolificacy.  Results  under research  and commercial  
conditions  have shown  that f Galway  x ^ Finn ewes give an increase  of
0.3 to 0.4 in litter size compared  with the Galway.  In addition,  gross 
margin  per ewe has increased  by up to 40%.
It is concluded  that, since the hill breeds  are more prolific  than Gal­
ways (under  lowland  conditions),  crossbred  ewes from hill breed  mothers  
should  form as large a portion  as possible  of the lowland  population.  The 
remainder  of the lowland  flock shou ’d be improved  Galway  types like the 
J Galway  x J Finn. If this objective  was attained  and improved  ram 
strains  were used as sires of the crossbred  ewes, then lambs  reared  per 
ewe could be rapidly  increased  to 1.45 for our lowland  sheep  industry.

During  the autumn  of 1977, 46 adult ewes were treated  with a horse  
anterior  pituitary  extract  (HAP)  in association  with intravaginal  proges ­
tagen to induce multiple  ovulation.  The ewes were bred by artificial  
insemination  at a predetermined  time after the end of HAP treatment.  
Prostaglandins  (PGF 2Q! and E2) were added to the diluted  semen used 
in the insemination  of 17 sheep. Laparotomies,  performed  for the pur­
pose of egg recovery,  showed that all of the inseminated  ewes had 
ovulated,  shedding  a total of 362 eggs of which 246 were recovered.  
Addition  of prostaglandins  to semen resulted  in a significantly  higher  
percentage  of fertilized  eggs.
A total of 43 fertilized  eggs which had been stored in the ligated 
rabbit  oviduct  were transferred  at rates of one to four {ter animal  to the 
uterine  horns of 18 adult recipient  ewes using local anaesthesia  and a 
laparotomy  crad'e  for rapid egg transfer;  12 ewes became  pregnant  with 
a total of 25 foetuses.
FACTORS  AFFECTING  OESTROUS  BEHAVIOUR  IN BEEF
CATTLE
SHEELAGH  O’LEARY  and J. F. ROCHE  
The Agricultural Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Difficulty  in detecting  oestrus is a limiting  factor in the use of 
artificial  insemination  in beef cattle. Oestrus  behaviour  was induced  in 
ovariectomised  (OVX)  beef heifers  using  oestradiol  cyclopentylpropionate  
(ECP)  and the time from ECP injection  to onset  of oestrus  behaviour  and 
the duration  of oestrous  behaviour  was recorded.
ECP administration  at various  times in relation  to the removal  of a 
progesterone  releasing  intravaginal  device  (PRID)  showed  that adminis ­
tering  ECP 24 hours  before  PRID  removal  significantly  increases  the time 
from ECP injection  to onset of oestrous  behaviour.  An injection  of 
progesterone  at the onset of oestrous  behaviour  significantly  shortened  
its duration  in OVX heifers  given ECP but did not shorten  the duration  
of oestrus  following  PRID  removal  in intact  heifers.  In the intact  heifers, 
the interval  from the end of oestrus  to ovulation  was longer in those  
that received  progesterone  at the onset of oestrus  than in those that did 
not.
Subjecting  the OVX heifers  to stress before ECP injection  did not 
affect either the time from ECP injection  to the onset of oestrus  behav ­
iour or the duration  of oestrus  behaviour.

HALOTHANE  SENSITIVITY  AND MEAT  QUALITY  IN 
IRISH  PIGS

The improvement  of the pig as an efficient  meat producing  animal  
has been associated  with two closely  related  problems,  namely,  an in­
crease  in the susceptibility  to stress  which  may cause  sudden  death  during  
handling  and transport  for example,  and an increasing  incidence  of pale,  
soft and exudative  (PSE)  meat which  is an undesirable  raw material  for 
manufacturing  processes.
In recent  years Dutch  research  workers  have found  that stress  suscep ­
tible pigs show an adverse  reaction  to the anaesthetic  gas halothane.  As 
a result of this, a specific  test has been developed  whereby  pigs which  
react positively  to halothane  are considered  to be susceptible  to stress 
and likely  to produce  PSE meat.
A total of 464 young pigs entering  one of the two national  testing  
stations  have been subjected  to the ‘halothane  test ’ between  October  
1976 and February  1978, comprising  350 Landrace,  66 Large  White  and 
48 Irish Welsh. The average  weight  at testing  was 24,5 kg. A total of 19 
pigs reacted  positively  to the test, 16 (4.6%)  of the Landrace  and 3 (6.3%)  
of the Irish Welsh. No reactors  were found  in the Large  White  breed.
Meat quality  data in the form of pHj readings  were analysed  for 549 
pigs (castrates,  females  and culled boars) from the two national  test 
stations  for the period  May 1976 to January  1977. The mean  pH, values  
were 6.14 ± .02 (258 pigs), 6.31 ± .02 (284 pigs) and 6.12 ± .12 (7 pigs)  
in the Landrace,  Large White and Irish Welsh  breeds  respectively.  The 
pH, in eight slaughtered  reactor  pigs was 5.88.
While the incidence  of reactors  was relatively  low in Ireland,  it was 
concluded  that in order to prevent  an increase  in the incidence  of halo­
thane sensitivity  and the undesirable  effects  associated  with this condition,  
all young boars of the Landrace  and Irish Welsh breeds  submitted  for 
performance  testing  should  be routinely  tested with halothane,  and that 
reactors  should  be culled.

EFFECT  OF TEMPERATURE  AND HUMIDITY  ON SOWS  
AND LITTERS
P. B. LYNCH
The Agricultural  Institute,  Moore  park, Fermoy.
Two experiments  were carried  out in controlled  environment  rooms  
at Moorepark.  The first experiment  involved  16 sows at each of two 
temperatures  27°C and 16°C from day 110 of pregnancy  to weaning  at 
31 days old. Sow feed intake  was significantly  higher  (P<0.01)  and lacta ­
tion weight  loss lower (P<0.05)  at 16° C. The newborn  pigs at 16°C  
had lower rectal temperatures  at 12 hrs (P<0.01)  and 36 hrs of age 
(P<0.05),  and were heavier  at weaning  (P<0.05).  Sow respiration  rate 
and rectal temperature  were higher at 27°C both before farrowing  
(P<0.01,  P<0.10  respectively)  and after farrowing  (P<0.01  and P<0.05).
In the second  experiment  two levels  of humidity  75-80%  and 67-70% 
RH were compared  at 27°C with 24 sows on each treatment.  None  of the 
parameters  measured  including  sow feed intake,  sow weight loss, sow 
respiration  rate and rectal  temperature,  was significantly  affected  by treat ­
ment.
INHIBITORY  SUBSTANCES  IN MILK

Department  of Veterinary  Medicine  and Pharmacology,

The presence  of antibiotics  in milk is an inevitable  consequence  of the 
treatment  of dairy cows with these drugs. The persistence  of antibiotic  
residues  depends  upon the antibiotic  itself, the complete  formulation  of 
the product,  the route of administration  to the animal  and is further  sub­
ject to wide individual  variations  within  the animal  itself.
There is intense  competition  in the veterinary  antibiotic  market  with 
at least 40 separate  organisations  marketing  their own brand of product.  
There  are at least 70 different  formulations  of intramammary  tubes  on the 
market  with a further  86 or more injectable  preparations  of antibiotics.  
Each one of these products  require  to be tested to determine  effective  
withholding  times for milk.
The market  requirement  for milk is that it should  be free from anti­
biotics,  i.e. there is a zero tolerance  set for the presence  of antibiotics  in 
milk. Reputable  scientists  recognise  that this is a scientific  impossibility  
and merely  means  that no antibiotic  must be detected  in milk irrespec ­
tive of what test is used. The tests used to detect antibiotics  in milk 
are generally  non-specific  in nature  and are referred  to as tests for inhibi ­
tors. The TTC and Inter tests have been widely  accepted  both here and 
in the U.K. for a number  of years. However,  a newer  more sensitive  test 
known  as the DELVO  P test is now gaining  broad  acceptance  in Ireland  
and is creating  problems  for the pharmaceutical  industry,  the milk pro­
ducer  and the consumer.  Attempts  to clarify  some of the issues  involved 
were discussed.

Grass and Legume  Cultivars  to 
Maximise  Production  of High  
Quality  Silage
M. A. M. do VALLE  RIBEIRO  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Oak Park Research  Centre,  Carlow.
The scarcity  of silage  in Ireland  is aggravated  by its generally  poor qual ­
ity. The aim of this paper is to show how the use of bred cultivars  of 
grass and legume  herbage  species  when properly  managed,  can produce  
high yields of good quality  silage and consequently  improve  animal  per­
formance.
Grasses
Ryegrasses  are the mainstay  of reseeded  Irish pastures  and therefore,  
this paper  will be dealing  only with cultivars  of the three ryegrass  species.
The quality  assessment  of the ensiled  herbages  is based  on its in vitro  
digestibility.  This is measured  in terms of D-value,  which  is the percen ­
tage of in vitro digestible  organic  matter  in the total dry matter.
It is well known  that as grass grows  during  spring  and early summer,  
the yield of dry matter  increases  but the digestibility  falls. This fall is 
slow at first but reaches  about  0.4 digestibility  units per day as the grass 
matures.  The increase  in yield of dry matter  during  this period  may be 
100-200  kg per hectare  per day. Consequently,  a delay  of one week in the 
time of cutting  can produce  a considerable  deterioration  of the silage  
quality. As greater  emphasis  is being placed  on quality  the right time 
for cutting  is when the digestibility  of the herbage  reaches  67D value.
The average  date of first cut of 67-D herbage  varies  with the ryegrass 
species  and within  perennial  ryegrass  with the maturity  group  of the cul- 
tivar. Thus,  early and medium-early  cultivars  of perennial  ryegrass  should  
be harvested  between  20 to 25 May, medium-late  cultivars  on the first 
days of June, late types on the second  week in June and the very late, 
such as Endura  and Angela,  between  15 to 20 June. Cultivars  of Italian  
and hybrid  ryegrasses  should  be cut on 20-25 May. Regarding  tetraploid  
perennial  ryegrasses  the fall in digestibility  is slower  than in the diploid  
cultivars  and their digestibility  at heading  is higher  than that of diploid  
cultivars  with similar  date of heading.  Therefore,  the inclusion  of tetra ­
ploid cultivars  in mixtures  for conservation  is advisable.
There are some situations  in which a quality  level other than 67-D 
has to be adopted.  So, in dairy farms  which  aim at high milk production  
the herbage  ensiled  must have a D-value  not lower  than 70. There  is also 
the case in which it suits a farmer  best to cut a larger  bulk of moderate  
quality  silage and therefore  the 63-D level should  be more appropriate.  
The time of the first harvest  is affected  by weather  conditions.
Spring  grazing  reduces  the yield of the first silage cut and delays 
heading  and the date at which  a grass  reaches  a given  D-value.  The delay 
does not normally  exceed  a week  and depends  on the date when  the sward 
is closed  for silage. In areas of early spring  grazing  which  can be closed 
at the end of March  or first week of April the use of a mixture  based on 
early or medium-early  cultivars  is recommended.  This gives a first cut 
with a reasonably  high yield of good quality  silage at the end of May.  
When,  on the other hand, a pasture  cannot  be closed  until late April the 
use of medium-late  or late cultivars  is advisable.
Two large scale experiments  in which  ryegrass  cultivars  were assessed 
in terms  of silage  and beef production  have been carried  out at Oak Park  
and the results  are given in Tables  1 to 3.
Both trials were undersown  with barley,  the first in the end of March  
1970 and the second  at the beginning  of April 1975. In the first experi ­
ment an early and a medium-late  cultivar  of perennial  ryegrass.  Oriel and 
Spirit,  together with Lemtal  Italian  ryegrass,  were compared  under a 3-cut  
silage management.  In the second.  Oriel was replaced  by the medium- 
early cultivar,  Oakpark,  and the management  consists  of three cuts for 
the perennial  cultivars  and four cuts for Lemtal.  Nitrogen  inputs  of 280- 
325 kg N/ha per annum  were used in the first trial and 395 kg N/ha  are 
being applied  in the experiment  in progress.  Appropriate  amounts  of P 
and K per hectare  were spread  every  year.

Data on Tables 1 to 3 show how it is possible  to obtain  very high 
yields  of good quality  silage in the first harvest  when this is made at the 
right time and under  reasonable  weather  conditions.  Thus,  a delay  of the 
harvest  and unfavourable  weather  conditions  caused  a deterioration  of 
quality  of the first-cut  silage  of Spirit  in 1976 (Table  3).

Regarding  the subsequent  cuts the quality  of the silage  produced  de­
pends on the length of the regrowth  interval.  For Italian  ryegrass  the 
regrowth  periods  should  not exceed  4-5 weeks  (Tables  1, 2 and 3). As a 
result  of this shortening  of the regrowth  intervals  the number  of harvests  
has to be increased  from 3 to 4 (Table  3). This reduces  the total DM yield 
and in unfavourable  years as 1975 and 1976 the amount  of herbage  col­
lected in some cuts does not repay the high cost of harvest  and ensiling. 
For perennial  ryegrass,  6-7 week regrowth  intervals  are recommended  
to produce  reasonable  yields  of high quality  silage.
Early and medium-early  and medium-late  cultivars  of perennial  rye­
grass are suitable  for the 3-cut silage  system  of conservation.  The results  
obtained  with Spirit seem to indicate  that medium-late  cultivars  are the 
most appropriate  for this type of management,  however,  unusual  hot dry 
summers  can seriously  affect the third harvest.  Thus,  in 1976 a third har­
vest of Spirit  was not possible  (Table  3).
The use of pure swards  of Italian  ryegrass  for conservation  does not 
seem advisable  with a possible  exception  when a farmer  wants  to sow a 
very short ley of 12 to 18 months.  The results  of the experiments  show 
also that when Lemtal  is undersown  with a cereal crop its DM yield in 
the first harvest  season is lower than that obtained  when it is directly  
sown in the autumn.

The 3-cut  silage  management  has a depressing  effect  on the persistency 
of perennial  cultivars  and the yields  drop substancially  after four or five 
years.
The digestibility  of herbages  at the ensiling  time is usually  higher  than 
that of the corresponding  silages and the difference  depends  on the 
efficiency  of the conservation  process.  Thus, in the Oak Park experiments  
the digestibility  of the silage  was on average  2-4 units lower  but in badly 
preserved  silages  can be 10 units lower.
The overall  mean  of crude  protein  content  for the first cut silages  was 
9.9% which is lower than the 12% requirement  of most stock. Protein  
contents  of subsequent  cuts were higher  than the 12% level.
The ryegrass  silages  produced  in 1972 and 1973, and 1976 were tested 
in winter  feeding  trials in which Friesian  steers, averaging  447 kg live- 
weight,  were fed ad libitum  without  any supplementation.  The mean 
daily liveweight  gains obtained  were as follows :

Animals  fed silages  of higher  digestibility  performed  better  than those 
fed lower digestibility  silages  and the change  of management  of Lemtal  
swards  in the second  trial resulted,  as expected,  in a great improvement  
of the animal  performance.
Legumes  
White  clover
Although  white clover  is less important  as a herbage  legume  for con­
servation  than red clover and lucerne,  its role in grass/clover  swards  
under a grazing  and conservation  management  must not be underesti ­
mated. Apart  from supplying  nitrogen  to the sward,  this legume  retains  
a very high digestibility  of about 75-D over long periods  and the fall in 
digestibility  is much slower  than for the other two legumes  and for the 
ryegrasses.  Its crude protein  content  is also very high, normally  over 
20%. Therefore,  the quality  of the silage harvested  from a grass/clover  
sward will be improved  in proportion  to the amount  of white clover  
present.
The best cultivars  of white clover  are Blanca  and Kersey  but some ­
times it is difficult  to obtain  seed and its price is very high (£6.60  per kg). 
Cultivars  Sabeda,  Grasslands  Huia and Milkanova  can be used as alter ­
natives.
Red clover
The dramatic  increase  in the cost of nitrogen  caused  by the oil crisis 
and the world shortage  of protein  have brought  renewed  interest  in red 
clover  as a special  purpose  crop. This red clover  revival  was helped  by 
the fact that at this time plant breeders  have introduced  markedly  im­
proved new cultivars,  mostly tetraploids,  which are capable  of giving  
high yields when grown  pure or with a grass companion  without  use of 
fertiliser  N for 2-3 years. On the other hand advances  in the technology  
of silage  making  solved  the problems  of ensiling  red clover.
The best cultivars  presently  available  are the four tetraploid —Hun-  
garopoly.  Red Head,  Teroba  and Tetri. There  is no significant  difference  
in yield between  these cultivars  but Hungaropoly  is possibly  more per­
sistent  than the other three. These four cultivars  are resistant  to clover  
rot. In cases of seed scarcity  tetraploid  cultivars  can be replaced  by the
diploid  cultivars  Violetta,  Sabtoron  and Kuhn which give good yields  
particularly  in areas  free of clover  rot. Red clover  has a high crude  protein  
content  (16-18%)  and is also rich in minerals,  but has a low water  soluble 
carbohydrate  content  (8-12%).
High yields are dependent  on a satisfactory  crop establishment.  In 
direct  sowing  a fine tilth, a firm weed free seed bed and a soil pH of 6 to 
6.5 plus generous  application  of phosphorus  and potassium  are basic 
requisites  for good,  even establishment.  Under  Irish conditions  red clover 
or red clover/grass  mixtures  can be sown from April to the first week in 
August. The pure-sward  is very often open and susceptible  to weed in­
vasion,  but in red clover/grass  swards  the invasion  by weeds  is reduced. 
A good establishment  can be obtained  from sowing  red clover  under a 
cereal crop which  will be harvested  as arable  silage in July. A seed rate 
of 13-18 kg/ha  should  be used for a pure stand  and for a red clover/grass  
sward 13 kg of clover mixed with 6 kg of grass per hectare  should  be 
sown. Annual  fertiliser  requirements  are 40-60 kg of phosphorus  and 
200-300  kg of potassium  per hectare.
Although  yields  of DM as high as 12 t/ha per annum  can be obtained  
from pure stands  cut three times for silage,  the use of mixed  red clover/  
grass swards  is recommended.  The main advantages  of the mixed  sward 
are: a DM yield of 20-30%  higher  than in the pure clover sward,  the 
herbage  is easier to ensile, the presence  of a grass companion  reduces 
annual  weeds  and minimizes  the wheel  damage  to clover,  and the herbage 
is better  balanced  nutritionally  than in the pure sward.
Considering  the companion  grass,  Italian  ryegrass  is not recommended  
and the best choice  is a medium-late  perennial  ryegrass  cultivar  such as 
Spirit,  Talbot,  Barlenna,  Combi  and the tetraploids  Taptoe  and Barlatra.
The most appropriate  management  seems to be a first cut in early 
June followed  by two subsequent  cuts in early August  and late September  
respectively.
The D-value  of red clover at the time of the first silage harvest  is 
61-63D.  This low D-value  is acceptable  because  the intake  of red clover 
silage by stock is 20-40 per cent higher  than that of grasses  of the same 
digestibility  (Castle,  1975). Therefore,  silages  with 60-63D  and a high 
protein  content  are considered  of good quality. A 60D digestibility  is 
obtained  in second  and third cuts made with 6-week  regrowth  intervals.
The dry matter  content  of red clover  herbages  is normally  very low 
(12-14%)  and therefore,  they must be wilted to 23-25%.  The use of an 
additive  is essential  and Add-F.  containing  85% formic  acid, has been 
used elfectively  at rates of 2.3-4.5  1/t lifted material.
Regarding  the bloat hazard  it is not important  with red clover  silage  
as it is when the herbage  is grazed  early in the growing  season.  However, 
no bloat problem  was observed  when red clover was grazed by store 
lambs  or cattle from October  to December.  Autumn  grazing  is ideal for 
fattening  store lambs.
Thompson  (1975)  reports  that the oestrogenic  level in red clover  silaae 
is enough  to depress  the reproductive  rate of ewes. Therefore,  ewes should
10
not be fed silage prior to, and during  mating. Braden  et al. (1971)  have 
demonstrated  that cattle metabolize  plant oestrogens  more rapidly  than 
sheep  and thus may have a greater  tolerance  to oestrogenic  effects.
The silage role of the red clover crop is mainly  in arable farming  
systems  where  it makes  an ideal break  crop. Red clover  improves  the soil 
structure  and promotes  the replenishment  of soil N. Spring  barley  after  
a 3-year  tetraploid  red clover  ley yielded  5 t/ha with a N application  
of only 20 kg/ha  (Mackie,  1975).
Lucerne
Little is known  regarding  this legume  in Ireland  although  it has been 
grown  in a very small scale for drying.
This legume  is associated  with low rainfall  areas and with light dry 
soils where summer  drought  frequently  limits yield. It requires  a deep  
well drained  soil with a high pH (6.5-7.0).  Its deep rooting  system  ensures  
the production  of high yields of DM (12 -15 t/ha) in areas affected  by 
drought.  It can also be grown  on heavy soils provided  drainage  is ade­
quate  as it is very intolerant  of wet soil conditions.
A number  of highly  improved  new cultivars  which  are able to persist  
fully productive  for 4-5 years are available  and the best are : Europe,  
Sabilt,  Verneuil  and Vertus. All these cultivars  belong  to the early group  
and provide  three or four cuts per annum.
Europe  outyields  the other cultivars  by 10-15%  in the absence  of 
Verticillium  wilt. The other three cultivars  are resistant  to Verticillium  
wilt but Vertus  has the additional  advantage  of being resistant  to stem 
eelworm.
Cultivar  Europe  is being tested in a field scale experiment  at Johns ­
town Castle,  in pure and mixed swards. The total yields of dry matter  
obtained  from three harvests  in the first growing  season  were 12.8 t/ha 
in pure sward and 10.5 t/ha in mixed sward. This shows that, in con­
trast with red clover,  there is no advantage  in including  a companion  
grass with lucerne.
Lucerne  can be sown from April to the end of July but the April  
sowing  normally  gives a better establishment.  As for red clover  a good 
establishment  can be obtained  with a cereal cover  crop which  will be cut 
for silage in July.
Fertiliser  requirements  of lucerne  are 40 kg of phosphorus  and 200-300  
kg of potassium  per hectare  per annum.
The most suitable  management  for lucerne  is a first harvest  in late 
May followed  by two or three cuts with intervals  of six weeks between  
cuts.
Lucerne  silage is fairly low in digestibility  and at the time of the first 
harvest  has a 60D-value.  However,  its intake by stock is much higher  
than that of grass silages  of the same  digestibility.  A 60D level of digesti ­
bility is obtained  in the subsequent  cuts when  they are made  with 6-week 
regrowth  intervals.  Lucerne  silage has a high crude protein  content  (18- 
20%)  and is rich in minerals.
11
Lucerne  herbages  have a very low sugar content  and this made the 
production  of good  silages  difficult  before  the new improved  silage-making 
techniques  were introduced.  As for red clover the herbage  should be 
wilted for 24-48 hours and an additive  should  be used. The amount  of 
Add-F  for a crop with 20-25%  of DM should  be 3 1/t lifted material.  
There  are no bloat problems  with lucerne  silage.
Conclusions
1. The use of seeds mixtures  based on the ryegrass  cultivars  presently 
available  and specially  tailored  to produce  high yields  of good quality  
silage would reduce  significantly  the deficit  of animal  winter  fodder  
which  exists in Ireland.
2. On many farms in the arable  areas, where  soil conditions  and silage­
making  facilities  are satisfactory,  a greater  use of red clover  is recom ­
mended.
3. An attempt  should  be made  to introduce  lucerne  as a reliable  source  of 
forage in areas with light soils, where poor summer  growth  of the 
grasses  is always  a limiting  factor.

The Relative  Importance  of 
Digestibility,  Ensiling,  Fermentation  
ami Dry Matter  Content  in Limiting  
the Utilisation  of Silage by 
Beef Cattle
A. V. FLYNN  and R. K. WILSON

For reasons  associated  with climate and the mechanisation  of farm  
operations,  ensiling  has become  the first choice  system  of forage  conser ­
vation on most intensive  and modernised  farms. Many problems  have 
been associated  with the ensiling  process  and with silage as a feed for 
ruminants  over the years. The purpose  of this paper is to examine  the 
major factors  which have been associated  with the restriction  of animal  
production  from ensiled  herbage  and examine  the relative  importance  of 
each of them in quantitative  terms  where  possible.  The factors  which  will 
be discussed  are digestibility,  preservation,  dry matter  content,  ensiling  
per se and fine chopping.  While  factors  like secondary  heating  during  the 
feeding  of silage (Zimmer,  1973; Wilkins,  1975) and the non-anaerobic  
storage  of silage (Ruxton  et al, 1975) can have a profound  effect  on silage 
preservation  and consequently  on the efficiency  of animal  production  from 
silage,  their effects  are well understood  and are not discussed  here.
Silage  Digestibility
While it has for long been recognised  that digestibility  of a forage  is 
a factor of major importance  determining  its intake and nutritive  value  
(McCullough,  1961; Balch  and Campling,  1962; McCarrick,  1965; Castle  
and Watson,  1969) higher  digestibility  in a silage has not always  been 
associated  with higher  production  (Tayler  and Aston,  1967) due to inter ­
action  of other factors  (Wilkins,  1974; Wilkins,  1975). Because  of these  
interactions  the relationship  between  dry matter  digestibility  (DMD)  and 
animal  production  has seldom  been described  in quantitative  terms over 
a wide range of digestibility.  In general,  a change  in silage quality  has a 
considerably  greater  effect on the productivity  of beef cattle than on the 
production  of milk in short term experiments  by dairy cows (Waldo,  
1977). Thus it is of interest  to examine  the results  of 40 feeding  experi ­
ments at this station  in which  well preserved  silages  were offered  as the 
sole feed to steers  weighing  400 kg. In most experiments,  pre-experiment  
slaughter  groups  were included  to allow  absolute  measurement  of carcase  
gain. The summary  presented  in Table 1 shows  a clear relationship  be­
tween DMD and animal  performance  in terms of daily liveweight  gain 
and daily carcase  gain. Silages  which  produced  daily liveweight  gains of

less than 0.34 kg/day  had mean DMD  = 60.4% while those which pro­
duced  more than 0.75 kg/day  had DMD  = 74.5%.
In these trials animals  were fed in groups  and mean silage  dry matter  
intakes  were recorded.  There  was a close association  between  daily dry 
matter  intake  and DMD. It ranged  from 1.6% of mean  liveweight  at 60% 
DMD  to over 1.9% at 74% DMD.  This is in contrast  with results  of work 
with sheep  (Wilkins  et al, 1971; Demarquilly,  1973) in which  the digesti ­
bility effect was masked  by variation  in preservation  but is in agreement  
with the results  of an experiment  of Wilkins  and Tetlow  quoted  by Wil­
kins (1974).
It is of interest  to note the magnitude  of the growth  rate of cattle fed 
silages  having  DMD  of 74%. Expressed  either  in terms of liveweight  or 
carcase  gain this is good production  by cattle fed only conserved  grass  
and approaches  the production  (0.57 -0.60 kg carcase/day)  expected  of 
similar  cattle  on grazed  grass  over an entire grazing  season.  The difference  
between  production  from these good silages  and the expected  production  
from grass can be explained  by difference  in feed digestibility.
Similarly  high levels of liveweight  gain on grass silage only have 
occasionally  been reported  (Stewart,  1973; Demarquilly  and Dulphy,  
1976; Mcllmoyle,  1976a'  but other reports  in terms of beef carcase  pro­
duction  are not available.
Silage  Preservation
It is generally  appreciated  that high quality  wet herbage  is difficult  to 
ensile and is predisposed  to clostridial  fermentation.  It is possible  that 
imperfect  preservation  may be responsible  for the infrequent  reports  of 
high production  from silage. Table 2 illustrates  how the quality  of the 
preservation  reduces  the production  potential  of a high quality  silage. In 
this experiment,  the well preserved  silage was treated  with 2.3 I 85% 
formic  acid per tonne  grass at time of ensiling.

value of formic  acid treatment  in ensuring  good preservation  with low 
ammonia  content  in the silage is demonstrated  and the improved  preser ­
vation  is reflected  in animal  production.

^ In vitro DMD results  for only 5 experiments
Various  reports  (Forbes  and Jackson,  1971; Mcllmoyle,  1976b;  Alder,  
McLeod  and Gibbs, 1969; Dulphy  and Demarquilly,  1977) indicate  that 
the effect of imperfect  preservation  on silage nutritive  value is reduced  
when supplementary  energy  is offered  with the silage. The effect is not 
completely  eliminated,  however.  Furthermore,  imperfect  preservation  
results  in reduced  efficiency  of conservation  of stored  dry matter  (Kauf-  
mann  and Zimmer,  1969; Waldo  et al, 1971) and in reduced  digestibility  
of dry matter  fed out of storage  (Waldo  et al, i971; Castle  and Watson,  
1970a). Thus for several  reasons,  the necessity  for perfect  preservation  
in the silo is demonstrated.
In farm practice,  silage  preservation  can be influenced  by grass species, 
content  of fermentable  carbohydrate  and by ensilage  techniques.  Jones  
(1970)  found that ryegrass  (LoUum  perenne)  was easier  to ensilage  than
17
cocksfoot  {Dactylis  glomerata)  or timothy  {Phleum  pratense).  We have 
confirmed  this in many  laboratory  experiments.
The water soluble  carbohydrate  (WSC)  content  of the grass at time 
of ensiling  is a major  determinant  of the course  of silage  fermentation  in 
the absence  of effective  additive  treatment.  While fermentable  carbohy ­
drate levels as low as 6 to 8% of the dry matter  have been suggested  as 
adequate  (Smith,  1962), it appears  from a survey  of 800 silages,  mainly 
abstracted  from published  results,  that a WSC content  equivalent  to 3% 
in the solution ensiled  is required  to give a 95% chance  of the silage  being  
well preserved  without  additive  treatments  (Wilson  and Flynn,  unpub ­
lished data). This 3% WSC solution  corresponds  to an average  14% 
WSC  in the dry matter  of samples  in this survey.
Delayed  sealing  has a detrimental  effect  on silage  preservation  (Hen ­
derson  and McDonald,  1975) and has a considerable  modifying  influence  
on the minimum  WSC  content  required  to ensure  good preservation  (Wil­
son, unpublished  results).
The absence  of a quick test which may be applied  in the field to 
reliably  estimate  the WSC content  of the herbage  being ensiled  means 
that farmers  must adopt a policy  of using formic  acid or other effective  
additive  on all high quality  herbage  ensiled  without  wilting.
Another  problem  often associated  with wet silages is low nitrogen  
retention.  While most studies  as reviewed  by Wilkins  (1974)  record  low 
nitrogen  retention  on wet silages,  it is of interest  to note that Waldo  et al 
(1969)  and Waldo  et al (1971)  and Waldo  et al (1973)  found acceptably  
good nitrogen  retention  on wet silage in which ammonia  nitrogen  was 
less than 10% of total nitrogen  in contrast  with low nitrogen  retention  
on poorly  conserved  silage  with 14% of total N as ammonia.  Low nitro ­
gen retention  may well be a specific  characteristic  of poorly preserved  
silage  rather  than a characteristic  of wet silages  in general.
Silage preservation  is commonly  accepted  as being good if less than 
14% of the nitrogen  is present  as ammonia.  It appears  from the results 
of nitrogen  retention  studies  and animal  production  studies  that a silage  
described  as being  well preserved  should  have less than 10% of its nitro ­
gen present  as ammonia.
Silage  dry matter  content
Raising  the dry matter  content  of herbage  before  ensiling  has for long 
been recognised  as a means  of ensuring  good preservation  in the silo and 
is very often regarded  as essential  in order to produce  silage with a high 
nutritive  value. Reports  of experiments  comparing  forages  of different 
dry matter  content  usually  attribute  any differences  found  to the difference  
in dry matter  content  even though  in many instances  the preservation  of 
the wetter  forage  might  have been quite imperfect  by any standard.  That  
is to say that differences  have been attributed  to dry matter  content  which  
could logically  have been attributed  to preservation.
Table 4 is a summary  of reports  comparing  forages  differing  in dry 
matter  content.

They have been arbitarily  segregated  into 2 groups depending  on 
whether  the direct  cut unwilted  silage was poorly  preserved  or well pre­
served  as indicated  by ammonia  (% total N) and/or  pH. The response  
to wilting  in terms of dry matter  intake  and animal  production  is given 
as the difference  between  unwilted  and wilted  expressed  as a percent  of 
the unwilted.  This allows  the results  of experiments  with dairy cows and 
with growing  cattle  to be summarised  in one table. As expected,  there is 
a considerable  response  to wilting  in both dry matter  intake  and animal  
production  when  wilted  silage  is compared  with poorly  preserved  unwilted  
silage. It is of considerable  interest  to note that despite  an apparent  in­
crease in dry matter  intake  due to wilting,  a production  response  is not 
normally  recorded  when wilted silage is compared  with well preserved  
unwilted  silage. Efficiency  of conversion  of forage  dry matter  to product  
appears  to be reduced  by wilting  when  wilted  silage  is compared  with well 
preserved  unwilted  silage. The mean reduction  in experiments  reviewed 
in Table  4 was 10.8%. This aspect  of forage  dry matter  content  has been  
ignored  in most reports  though  it has been noted  and discussed  by some 
(Waldo  et al, 1969; Presthegge,  1959). It indicates  that more highly  fer­
mented  and/or  wetter  silage might utilised  more efficiently  than the 
less fermented  drier forage.
There  have been several  comparisons  of unwilted  and wilted  silage  for 
beef cattle at our Institute.  The results  of 3 experiments  are summarized  
in Table  5.

In general,  dry matter  intake has been higher  for the wilted silage.  
This difference  has not, however,  been reflected  in carcase  gain. In 
another  experiment  (Flynn,  1974), wilting  increased  liveweight  gain but 
did not raise carcase  weight. The discrepancy  between  liveweight  gain 
and carcase  gain in comparisons  of forages  of different  dry matter  con­
tent has been noted before and has been shown to be attributable  to 
differences  in rumen  contents  (McCarrick,  1967). Again  there is the sug­
gestion  that the wilted  dry matter  is utilised  less efficiently  than the un­
wilted  dry matter.
• Since Ekern  and Reid (1963)  showed  more efficient  utilisation  of the 
dry matter  in a highly fermented  forage there have been basic studies 
reviewed  by Wilkins  (1974)  and Waldo  (1977)  indicating  similar  efficiency  
of utilisation  of energy  in wet and dry forages.  These  results  are in con­
flict with the apparently  better utilisation  of wet silage in feeding  trials  
but this may arise out of the fact that silage dry matter  intake is often  
a biased  estimate  of energy  intake (Waldo,  1977). It must, however,  be 
of some relevence  to note that in a comparison  of hay and silage the 
carcases  of silage  fed cattle were at least as heavy  as, and contained  more 
fat than, carcases  of hay fed cattle (McCarrick,  1967). There is a clear  
implication  in these results  that the silage  energy  is utilised  more efficiently  
than the energy  in the dry forage. This aspect  of forage  conservation  has 
to date received  too little research  attention.
The results  of a recent  experiment  (Flynn,  1976) comparing  the feed­
ing value of wilted silage (50% dry matter)  and hay for beef heifers  are 
summarised  in Table  6. Carcase  production  on the  two feeds  were similar  
but again there was a difference  in carcase  fat content  in favour  of the 
wetter,  fermented  forage. These  results  require  an explanation.

Wilted  silage Hay
Carcase  wt. kg 193.3 191.6
Kidney  -1- channel  fat kg 6.4 5.0
Fat trim in carcase  kg 24.7 21.0
Whether  the explanation  might  be found  in the proportions  of volatile 
fatty acids (VFA ’s) in the rumen  is not clear. While  the volume  of litera ­
ture on rumen VFA ’s and their nutritional  significance  is large, very 
little of it deals specifically  with the effect of conservation  system on 
rumen  VFA pattern. What evidence  there is in this area is conflicting.  
While  some reports  indicate  lower acetic/higher  propionic  concentration  
on wetter and more highly fermented  forages  than on drier forages 
(Ekem  and Reid, 1963; Hawkins  et al, 1970; Rohr et al, 1974; Schaadt  
and Johnson,  1969; Dash et al, 1974) others have found the opposite  
(Zelter,  1969; Donaldson  and Edwards,  1976). In the experiment  referred 
to in Table 6 the rumen  VFA ’s were determined  on samples  of rumen
20
liquor  taken soon after slaughter  (Wilson  and Flynn, 1976). Acetic/pro-  
pionic  ratio was 3.5 for the wilted  silage compared  with 4.0 for the hay. 
While the difference  is small it is in the direction  which is regarded  as 
favouring  more efficient  production  by meat animals  (Ekern  and Reid,  
1963; Weiss et al, 1967) and is similar  in magnitude  to a difference  be­
tween grass and silage reported  by Donaldson  and Edwards  (1976) as 
being  large enough  to be of nutritional  significance.
Effect  of ensiling
While it is accepted  that efficient  ensiling  has little adverse  effect on 
herbage  digestibility  (Harris  and Raymond,  1963; Demarquilly,  1973) it 
is generally  accepted  that ensiling  reduces  the nutritive  value of herbage  
through  reduction  of voluntary  intake. Reduced  intake  of silage relative  
to the grass from which the silage was made has been demonstrated  
(Demarquilly  and Jarrige,  1970; Donaldson  and Edwards,  1976; Lancas ­
ter, 1975; Bryant  and Lancaster,  1970; Harris  and Raymond,  1963) but 
others working  with corn silage containing  very low levels of ammonia  
have found little difference  between  fresh and ensiled  material  (Bergen 
et al. 1974; Dinius  et al. 1968; Wilkinson  et al, 1976). Donaldson  and 
Edwards  (1976)  using sheep found that wilting  the grass and ensiling  it 
with formic  acid raised silage intake  to the level achieved  on the grass. 
Most of the experiments  quoted  here were conducted  with sheep. In 
general  the intakes  of silages  by caged sheep tend to be rather  low and 
one must question  whether  the results  of many silage experiments  con­
ducted  with sheep  are really  relevant  to cattle.
Flynn (1976) using 350 kg cattle found little reduction  in intake of 
grass silage  made with formic  acid relative  to intake  of fresh grass.
Results  of B. Michalet  (quoted  by Demarquilly  and Dulphy,  1976)  
showed  reduced  dry matter  intake  of fine chopped  herbage  by sheep  due 
to ensiling  but no reduction  in intake  by heifers. Flynn  (1977)  compared  
fresh grass and silage made with formic  acid in a 106 day experiment  
using 430 kg steers. All silages  were well preserved.  Animal  production  
results  are summarised  in Table  7.
Table 7

Daily carcase  gain 
kg0.42 0.43 0.43 0.36
21
While daily liveweight  gains differed  between  the feeds dry matter  
intake  and daily carcase  gain were very similar.  Incidentally,  these results 
show once again how misleading  it can be to assess  treatment  effect on 
beef production  in terms of liveweight  change  only. The experiment  was 
conducted  to quantify  the silage intake problem  and its effect on beef 
production.  This result,  when viewed  along  with the high levels of pro­
duction  achieved  with the highly  digestible  silages  in Table 1, questions  
the existence  of the problem  for beef cattle fed on well preserved  silage.
It is becoming  apparent  that an ensiling  fermentation  in which am­
monia  production  is restricted  will not reduce  the nutritive  value of her­
bage and will not present  a feed intake  problem  of practical  importance  
for beef cattle.
Fine chopping
Several reports have appeared  recently  showing  an effect of fine 
chopping  and comminution  on intake of silage by sheep and cattle.  
Dulphy  and Demarquilly  (1973) and Demarquilly  and Dulphy  (1976)  
using sheep found a variable  intake  response  to fine chopping.  Where 
responses  were large,  the effect  of chopping  was confounded  with a silage  
preservation  effect and the increase  tended  to be due more to very low 
intake  on long silage than to elevated  intake  on the finely  chopped  silage  
(Dulphy  et al, 1975). Likewise,  Deswysen  (1978) found an Increase  in 
intake  by sheep  due to fine chopping  of silage  just before  feeding.  Demar ­
quilly  and Dulphy  (1976)  quote results  of B. Michalet  which  show a con­
siderable  response  to fine chopping  by heifers. These results  also show  
that differences  observed  with sheep  may be much  greater  than differences  
observed  with cattle on the same feeds and illustrate  again  the danger  of 
applying  the results of sheep experiments  to cattle. Demarquilly  and 
Dulphy  (1975)  showed  a response  in terms  of intake  and milk production  
by cows to fine chopping  but the efficiency  with which  feed was converted  
to milk did not seem to be improved.  Better  (1978)  increased  intake  of 
cows progressively  by chopping  to 17 mm or 9 mm compared  with 72 
mm long silage. Chopping  stemmy  forage  through  a harvesting  machine  
set to a theoretical  chop length  of 17 mm did not increase  dry matter  in­
take of steers  whereas  chopping  of 6 mm theoretical  chop length  increased  
dry matter  intake  by 15% (Flynn,  1977). Mincing  or pulping  forage  has 
been shown  to increase  intake  (Thomas  et al, 1976; Greenhalgh  and Reid,  
1975) and production  by cattle  (Houseman  et al, 1975).
It appears  that this area of silage  research  is worthy  of more investiga ­
tion but care must  be taken  to separate  the effects  of chopping  and preser ­
vation. Perhaps  we should  expect  that the effect  of fine chopping  of silage  
should  be analogous  to the effect  of processing  dry forage  as summarised  
by Beardsley  (1964).  We should  look on fine chopping  of silage  as a means  
to increase  its nutritive  value relative  to that of the parent  herbage  rather  
than as a process  necessary  to maintain  in silage the nutritive  value of 
the parent  herbage.
22
Summary
High levels  of production  by beef catle are achievable  on grass silage 
if digestibility  is high and preservation  is very good. While silage dry 
matter content can influence  preservation  and through  preservation,  
influence  intake and animal  production,  low dry matter  content  per se 
is not a major  constraint  to the productivity  of wet silage. Utilisation  of 
the dry matter  in drier and less fermented  forages  often appears  lower 
than that in wetter  and more highly  fermented  silages.  Our rather  limited  
knowledge  of the influence  of conservation  system  on rumen  fermentation  
could be a constraint  in this area. The specific  effect of ensiling  by the 
best available  techniques  on the energy  intake and nutritive  value of a 
forage needs to be firmly established.  Failure  in the past to define the 
magnitude  of silage intake problem  for cattle has possibly  been a con­
straint  to clear thinking  in the whole area of forage conservation.  We 
should  not see degree  of chopping  as a constraint  to the achievement  of 
high production  from silage but rather  as a process  to increase  the nutri ­
tive value of feed above that of the fresh parent  herbage.  In these last 
two areas there is need for more work with cattle and cows as there is a 
danger  that results  obtained  with sheep  may apply  only to sheep.

The Interaction  of Harvesting  Machinery  
and Silage  Quality
P. COMERFORD
The Agricultural Institute,  Oakpark,  Carlow.
The importance  of high quality  silage in beef or dairy production  cannot  
be over-emphasised.  This is especially  true when we consider  the high 
costs of alternative  feeds. There is an increasing  awareness  throughout  
the country  of this need but for one reason  or another  many farmers  are 
finding  it difficult  to attain their targets. There are many factors  associ ­
ated with producing  a high quality  silage  but the one which  predominates  
is the stage of cutting.  Grass which  has been fertilized  and closed  up from 
early spring  must be cut before  June 1 if the high quality  obtainable  from 
such forage  is to be preserved.  Since over 60% of all silage  made  in the 
country  is harvested  by contractors  many quality-conscious  farmers  will 
be relying  on these contractors  to complete  work on time. As more  
farmers  change  to early  cutting  it is inevitable  that a peak demand  period  
will occur in the early stages of the season. Contractors  will therefore  
not be able to cope with all the work on hands. Already  the problem  is 
acute in some areas and farmers  must wait up to three weeks  for a con­
tractor. How can this problem  be avoided  ? A number  of solutions  are 
possible.
1. By selecting  grass strains which reach maximum  digestibility  at a 
later stage than usual or strains  which retain  their peak digestibility  
for a longer  period. Such grasses  are available  and it has been shown 
that their quality  will not deteriorate  to any extent  until the latter  part 
of June. Their use should  give the farmer  more scope to obtain a 
contractor  while herbage  quality  is still high.
By adopting  a multi-cut  system  the quantities  of grass for harvesting  
in the early cut will be reduced  and the work-load  will be spread  
more evenly  over the summer  months.  This would  suit the contractors  
since mid-summer  work is usually  slack. The current  method  usually  
applied by contractors  of charging  by the acre militates  strongly  
against  the multi-cut  system  and an hourly  or all-in charge  is a more  
satisfactory  method.  In addition,  the full impact  of the multi-cut  sys­
tem can only be felt if a high proportion  of farmers  opt for the 
method.  It would  seem that this solution  will be slow in alleviating  
a problem  which  is already  acute.
3. Increase  contractor  capacity.  This is a solution  which  has only very 
limited  application  since  contractors would  be unwise  to invest  heavily  
in equipment  which  would  only be used for a short period. Should  a 
contractor  increase  his harvesting  capacity  to cater for the early rush 
he may be forced  to charge  more than normal  for this service  to com­
pensate  for the short working  season.

4. The one sure way of overcoming  the early harvesting  problem  is for 
all those farmers  who cannot  get their work completed  on time by 
contract  to purchase  their own equipment.  While  this is not possible  
in every instance  there are many farmers  and groups  of farmers  who 
should  have their own equipment.  They would benefit  considerably.  
In making  the choice  as to whether  or not one should  have his own 
equipment  the following  points  should  be considered  :
(a) The ability to own and operate  machinery  : many farmers  have 
neither  the ability  nor the inclination  to own and operate  their own 
silage-making  equipment.  Such people  are best advised  to seek one 
of the other alternatives  or to offer inducements  to contractors  to 
commence  harvesting  on a pre-arranged  date.
(b) Can the silage making  routine be fitted into the existing  farming  
routine?  This question  must be carefully  considered.  If other equally  
important  work must be delayed  or omitted,  the advantages  can be 
eroded. If silage-making  coincides  with other important  work the 
speed of operation  is reduced  below acceptable  levels. It has been 
suggested  that the minimum  target should be 60 tonnes of silage  
harvested  per day. If harvesting  does not commence  until mid­
morning  and must finish early, it may be difficult  to achieve  this 
target with the machines  available.  In any event slow harvesting  
makes  it impossible  to ensile all the crop when the quality  is highest.
(c) Is ownership  of silage machinery  economically  feasible  ? In costing 
an operation  such as this it is usual to consider  what equipment  
already  exists and to assume  that it will be available  at operating  
costs plus repairs  only. Equipment  specially  purchased  for the work 
must of course  be fully costed  to the operation.  The total cost of the 
work is divided  by the acreage  harvested  and a cost j^r acre calcu ­
lated. The cost thus obtained  can be compared  with alternative  
methods  and if all things are equal the cheapest  harvesting  method  
can be employed.  For most small harvesting  systems  the break-down  
point with normal  contractor  charges  is between  50 and 120 acres.  
This does not take into consideration  the extra  cash benefits  accruing  
from a better  quality  silage as a result of early harvesting.  A recent  
study reported  in Great Britain**'  suggests  that when this is added,  
the break-even  points  can be halved.
Further  consideration  will be given to operating  costs and break-even  
points  in the following  paragraphs.
Forage  harvesting  systems  for private  ownership
There  are many  harvesting  systems  suitable  for farmer  ownership  and 
the five most popular  ones are presented  in Table 1. It shows  that the 
side mounted  single chop with a cutting  width of 50 inches  can harvest  
between  ^ and 1 acre per hour and can break-even  with a contractor  at 
50 acres harvesting  per year. At the other end of the scale the trailed  
precision  chop has a much higher  output  but would  need to harvest  over 
125 acres per year to justify  itself. If, of course,  an alternative  harvesting

harvesting  systems  using a scoring  system  of 0 - 5 for the various  head ­
ings. By combining  the information  contained  in Tables  1 and 2 it should  
be possible  to identify  the system  most suitable  for many  cases.

The pick-up  wagon
The pick-up  wagon forage harvesting  system is comparatively  new 
and merits  some additional  consideration.  The system  consists  of a pick­
up wagon,  three tractors,  a mower  and a buckrake.  Frequently  the third  
tractor  is omitted  and the same tractor  operates the mower  and buckrake.  
Most  pick-up wagons  have the ability  to take a grass  swath  off the ground
29
at a rate exceeding  two acres per hour. However,  since the wagon  must 
also transport  its load to the silo it is off the field for some of the time 
and the overall  harvesting  rate is much slower  than the picking  up rate 
(Table  1). This is one of the basic drawbacks  of the system. Farms  on 
which  the distance  between  the silo and the field exceeds  800-1000  yards  
are not suitable  to the wagon  system  unless  the machine  is large or the 
access  roads  exceedingly  good.
The power  required  by the wagon  is less than 50 hp but it is recom ­
mended  that at least a 60 hp tractor  be used with the larger  machines  to 
tow full wagons  up steep inclines  and as an insurance  against  instability  
when transporting.  Because  of their low power  requirement  wagon  sys­
tems need about  30% less fuel than a flail forage  harvesting  system  with 
the same output.  Since  crops  have to be pre-cut  for the wagon  the system  
lends itself to wilting.
Because  of the high cost of the wagon  and rotary  mower  the system  
has a high initial outlay but the running  costs are low because  of the 
small amount  of men and machines  involved.  Table 3 gives a summary  
of operating  costs for 50 to 100 hours  annual  use for a 5 and 7 year life 
span.

80 26.50 22.60
90 23.50 20.00
100 21.20 18.10
In using  a pick-up  wagon  for the first time a number  of points  require
special  attention  to ensure that the silage isproperly  made. Since the
wagon  only chops the grass coarsely  (some machines  have extra knives  
which  can chop to a theoretical  length  of 1^") and does no laceration,  the 
forage  can be very spongy  especially  when wilted. In order that over­
heating  does not occur  the forage  should  be well rolled during  ensiling.  
When the pits are full they should be covered  immediately  with two 
layers  of 500g polythene  and the edges thoroughly  sealed.
Group  ownership
Most of the systems  already  described  are economically  justifiable  
when the acreage  harvested  is in excess  of 70 acres. There  is however  no 
reason  why two farmers  with half the acreage  should not combine  to 
purchase  and operate  the equipment  between  them and reap the same  
benefits. The concept  of partnership  or group ownershirp  is not new
30
although  very few groups  have been organised  according  to any recog ­
nized set of rules. Loose partnerships  or instances  where a machine  is 
purchased  between  groups  of farmers  and passed  from one to the other  
have a very slender  chance  of surviving  unless  the partners  have very 
clear understandings.  It has been shown both in this country  and in 
England  that where the partnership  is established  according  to well 
recognised  procedure  with clearly  defined  rules to cater for every even ­
tuality,  the arrangements  work very satisfactorily.  Some properly-run  
groups  are in existence  for many years and have continued  to expand  
their joint commitments.
Apart from the advantages  of private  ownership  already  mentioned,  
small farmers  in partnership  also have the advantage  of a pooled  labour  
force on the few occasions  of the year when thy need them. If the in­
grained  opposition  exhibited  to the concept  of group  ownership  could be 
overcome  there is no reason why this pooling  of resources  could not 
contribute  substantially  to farming  progress  in the future.  Indeed,  smaller  
farmers  may have very little alternative  in the future if they are to 
continue  to compete  successfully  with their larger  neighbours.
Wilting
Much of the grass harvested  in this country  as wilted  silage does not 
qualify  for such a description.  In most cases grass which  is cut one day 
and picked  up the following  day without  any intermediate  treatment  will 
not have wilted sufficiently  especially  if the crop is young and heavy. 
Crops cut in May are particularly  difficult  to wilt because  dews are 
usually  heavy  and drying  is slow. Wilting  in inclement  weather  requires  
a particularly  dedicated  approach.  In many  European  countries  where  a 
wilt to 40-45%  is normal  the early  cut crops  are frequently  on the ground  
for 3-4 days and receive  about 4 teddings  or other treatments.  Under  
Irish conditions  where a wilt to 25-30%  would be more common  the 
early cut crop would  have to be on the ground  for two days and receive 
two teddings.  At least one of these teddings  could be eliminated  by the 
use of a mower/conditioner.  This is a mower  with a special  attachment  
which bruises  or lacerates  the crop during  cutting  and deposits  it in a 
fluffy loose stage on the ground.  Such swaths  dry faster than untreated  
ones. Flail mowers  also can be used and subsequent  drying  is very fast 
provided  weather  conditions  are suitable.  Using a flail mower  in wet 
conditions  can result in higher  than average  dry matter  losses.
Feeding  silage
The practice  of cutting  the silage from the clamp  and trough  feeding  
it to the animals  is becoming  increasingly  popular.  A number  of systems 
are available  for removing  the silage and their selection  depends  on the 
feeding  lay-out  and the number  of animals  to be fed. Figure 1 shows 
how the common  systems  compare  on costs and output  for various  num ­
bers of animals.  While  these figures  would  indicate  that the front loader,  
especially  with an hydraulic  tipping  and grab attachment  is the most  
economical  and fastest  system  for units up to 400 animals  it is not suit-
31

four feeding  systems.
32
able where the silo is a distance  from the animals.  This is particularly  
true for larger  units where  the feeder  box is much  more suitable.
Although  the block  cutter system  was not covered  in the above study  
later measurements  indicate  that it has an average  feeding  rate of about  
0.5 minutes  per animal  for transport  distances  of up to 50 metres. The 
main advantage  of the block feeder  is the almost  total absence  of waste 
at the silo. In fact over a week ’s supply  of blocks  can be removed  at the 
same time without  any deterioration  of the exposed  silage surface.  Some 
buildings,  however,  do not suit block  feeders  and even in the best lay-outs  
some hand forking  is almost  Inevitable.  This however  should  not deter  
the owners  of houses  with wide centre  passages  or peripheral  feeding  from  
stacking  the blocks  just outside  the reach  of the animals  and giving  them  
their daily ration  by hand,  off the top of the blocks.
Other  systems  using more elaborate  silage cutting,  transportation  and 
feeding  arrangements  are also available.  These  have not become  popular  
mainly  because  of their price and a high degree  of specialization.

Is there a Place for Irrigation  on 
Dairy Farms?
A. J. BRERETON
Agricultural  Institute,  Johnstown  Castle,  Wexford.
The drought  years 1975 and 1976 have raised  the question  of whether  or 
not there is a place for irrigation  in Ireland.  Even without  the extreme  
drought  of those two years, given time, the question  would have arisen  
as our systems  of land-use  became  more and more intensive.
There is no doubt that in every year all parts of this country  suffer  
from drought —we have drought  in summer  whenever  we have more than 
ten consecutive  days without  rain. This paper gives our best estimates  
of the yield losses in grassland  caused  by these droughts  and indicates  
how the value of these losses  relates  to the cost of irrigation.
The response  to water was measured  at two sites in Co. Wexford — 
one site was on a coarse  sandy-textured  brown  podzol  (light Screen  soil),  
the other on a loam-textured  podzolic  gley (heavy  Rathangan  soil)—in 
1973, 1974 and 1975 (Table 1). Summer  rainfall  was 509, 465 and 295 
mm (Apr-Sep  inc) in 1973, 1974 and 1975 respectively,  so that results  
were obtained  in both wet and dry years. At each site in each year a total 
of 260 N kg/ha/annum  was used in three applications  (110, 70 and 60 
N kg/ha  in March  and after each cut. Also 40 P kg/ha  and 50 K kg/ha  
were applied  in March,  and 50 K kg/ha  after the first cut. In 1974 and 
1975 the nitrogen  rate was increased  to 400 N kg/ha  to ensure  that any 
losses by leaching  would not affect yields (this was a safety precaution  
for experimental  purposes  only). Water was applied  to the plots twice 
each week at a rate which varied with rainfall  but which ensured  that 
irrigation  and rain equalled  3.3 mm/day  since the last application.  The 
greatest  response  was obtained  in the driest  year (1975),  the least response  
in the wettest  year (1973)  (Table  2).

These results  only indicate  that grass yield in Wexford  is normally  
restricted  by water storage  and that restrictions  can be as great as 4 
tonnes/ha/annum.  In order  to obtain  a more  general  picture  for the whole  
country  over a long pieriod  of years,  predictions  of yield restrictions  using  
meteorological  records  were estimated.
The meteorological  records  for Johnstown  Castle  for years 1973, 1974 
and 1975 were used to calculate  the expected  loss of yield due to drought  
in those years,  and these calculated  values  were compared  with the losses  
found by experimentation  in those years. This comparison  was made in 
order to check that the method  of prediction  was reliable. Calculated  
annual  yield losses  are shown  in Table  3.

The predictions  were well correlated  with the measured  responses  but 
the predictions  tended  to overestimate  the response.  On the basis of this 
trend all subsequent  predictions  were corrected  accordingly.
From the meteorological  records  for selected  sites potential  annual  
yield and average  yield loss due to water shortage  were estimated  (Table  
4).
The results indicate  that the yield loss due to drought  is about 1 
tonne/ha  inland for the country  as a whole with responses  tending  to 
increase  towards  the south east. Coastal  areas generally  show a higher 
response  especially  on the south  and east coasts.
In a Dutch survey  of European  irrigation,  this country  is shown  to 
have an average  annual  maximum  water deficit  less than 25 mm in the 
west and between  25 and 50 mm in the east (Table  5).

Thus,  an average  annual  response  to water  of about 1.5 tonnes  in the 
south  east, and less than 1.0 tonnes  in the west is expected,  and in the east 
this average  is exceeded  in more  than five years  of each 10 years.
There  was no consistent  difference  in response  between  the light and 
heavy  soils. Differences  in root distribution  could  account  for this. Table  
6 shows  that if the mairt body of roots at Rathangan  were in the top 10 
cm of the profile,  then starting  at field capacity,  30.2 mm of water  would 
be available.  This is equivalent  to about 10 days ’ water loss by evapo- 
transpiration  in summer. At Screen,  the same amount  of water  would  be 
available  if the main body of roots were in the top 15 cm of the profile  
(i.e. the roots at Screen  would need to be only two inches deeper). It 
would  appear  from these data that soil type may be less important  than 
rainfall  in determining  irrigation  need for normal  soils. In shallow  soils,  
available  water  may be restricted  by soil depth.

Irrigation  systems
Agricultural  irrigation  systems  are generally  mobile  so that only part 
of the area is irrigated  on each day. Commonly,  the interval  between 
irrigation  in each part of the area is 10 days. Evaporation  in summer  is 
about 2-3 mm per day so that after a 10-day  period without  rain it is 
necessary  to apply  about  25 mm of water.  Irrigation  systems  are designed 
to deliver  this rate in a day’s working.  On heavier  soils the infiltration  
rate of water  is about  5 mm/hr;  on light soils it is about  20 mm/hr,  thus,  
even on heavy  soils it is possible  to apply  40 mm in an 8-hour  day without  
flooding.  A 10-day irrigation  cycle is used because  in this part of the 
world,  with evaporation  rates of about 2.5 mm/day,  the deficit  after 10 
days is about  25 mm (one inch). It is generally  agreed  that, with a deficit 
between  zero and 30 mm, plant growth  is little affected.  But above this 
deficit  growth  begins  to be seriously  affected.  At 120 mm growth  ceases.
The conventional  rotary sprinkler  on lateral pipes, moved by hand  
along  a fixed main supply  line, is relatively  cheap,  but has a high labour  
requirement.  It is more appropriate  for small horticultural  systems.
The modern  mobile  irrigation  systems  are designed  for larger  acreages 
with reduced  labour  inputs. They require  larger  pumps  and make  greater  
demands  on water  supply;  they also cost more. The systems  vary widely 
in design  and cost (Table  7).

The capital  cost per hectare  increases  with the size of the system 
(Fig. 1). The annual  cost/ha  for running  and maintenance  decreases  as 
the size of the system  increases  (Table  8). These  costs are based  on 1976 
data for the United  Kingdom.  We have assumed  that all costs are the 
same in Ireland  except  for the charge  for abstraction  of water from the 
mains.  In Britain  this cost is 4.2 p/4.5 m* for direct  abstraction  m summer  
and 1 p/4.5 m’ for abstraction  in winter  for reservoir  storage.  In Ireland  
the water  charge  is 25p for 4.5 ml Hence  the cost of water  is a major  item 
in the annual  Wll in Ireland.

The volumes  of water involved  in irrigation  are large. In an average  
season six million  gallons  would be required.  This is equivalent  to a 
stored  volume  of 1 ha x 2.5 m deep.
If we calculate  the value of grass dry matter  as its Barley  equivalent,  
then the grass dry matter  response  required  to justify  various  levels of 
cost may be summarised  as follows :

At these cost levels it is clear that irrigation  is only likely to be pro­
fitable  in the south  east and then only when a good private  water  supply  
is available.  In the east and south coastal  areas of high response  even the 
most costly  system  could be justified.

Calf Housing —Design  Considerations  
when Planning  Housing  for 
Home  Reared  and Bought  In Calves
C. D. MITCHELL
The Scottish  Farm  Buildings Investigation  Unit, Craibstone,  
Bucksburn,  Aberdeen.
The major  objective  in the design  and planning  of calf housing  is to pro­
vide an environment  which will encourage  the production  of healthv  
calves.  ■’
In this paper a brief outline  of calf housing  work carried  out at the 
Scottish  Farm Buildings  Investigation  Unit (SFBIU)  will be followed  by 
two commercial  examples  of calf houses  designed  on the basis of the 
results  of the experimental  studies.
General  requirements
Calf housing  should  provide  a suitable  environment  both climatic  and 
structural  for the calf and the stockman.  It should  also provide  ample  
space for husbandry  and management  tasks and should be planned  in 
detail to achieve  these objectives  at the lowest  possible  capital  and with a 
low labour  requirement.
Commencing  in 1968, at the SFBIU,  the feasibility  of naturally  venti ­
lated uninsulated  calf housing,  termed  climatic  housing,  was examined  for 
rearing  calves  from approximately  one to twelve  weeks  of age throughout  
the year. From the experiments  it was established  that climatic  housing  
With good calf husbandry  and an adequate  plane  of calf nutrition  provides  
a very acceptable  low cost alternative  to tbe previously  common  fan ven­
tilated  insulated  and often  heated  calf housing.
The main advantages  of naturally  ventilated  calf housing  are •
1. reduced  capital  cost;
2. low running  costs (no fans, heaters  or controls);
3. immunity  from failure  of electric  power;
4. correct  design a reduced  management  requirement  as no adjustments  
need be made  to the ventilation  system  throughout  the year.
Studies  were also made on the design  of natural  ventilation  systems.
hese enabled  design  data to be produced  which  will ensure  a minimum  
ventilation  rate of 20 cubic feet per minute  per calf, with a minimum  
cubic air capacity  of 200 cubic feet per calf in calf houses  with different 
cross sections  to the original  experimental  unit.
The results  provided  a design  basis for naturally  ventilated  calf hous ­
ing and buildings  were designed  and costed  against  a fan ventilated  in­
sulated  calf house. The costings  showed  that naturally  ventilated  calf 
housing  reduces  the capital  cost of calf housing  when compared  with fan 
ventilated  insulated  calf houses.
43
Overall,  naturally  ventilated  calf housing  was established  as suitable  
for calf rearing  and acceptable  both environmentally  and economically  
as an alternative  to the fan ventilated  insulated  type of calf house (Mit­
chell, 1975).
Throughout  the work the calf was considered  as the designers  client  
and an understanding  of its requirements  was put as a primary  objective. 
In the past there  had been a tendency  for package  deal manufacturers  and 
farm buildings  designers  to use a similar  structure  for poultry,  pigs and 
calves  without  first ensuring  that it was suitable  for calves. Each class of 
livestock  requires  different  environmental  conditions.
With the calf, a designer  is basically  aiming  to provide : (1) a dry bed; 
(2) a well ventilated  calf house;  (3) a draught  free environment  during  the 
winter  months.
1. A dry bed is provided  by attention  to floor  drainage  beneath  straw  
bedding  and a minimum  floor slope of 1 in 20 is required.  The bedding  
will not move down  this slope. The effects  of flooring  type on calculated  
critical  temperatures  for a 50 kg calf in calm air on full feed are given in 
Table 1.

Calf lying on wooden  slats -10

Calf standing -10
* It is important  to remember  that the lower the critical temperature,  the 
better the calf is able to resist cold stress
It is often necessary  to have close site supervision  during  construction  
to ensure adequate  floor slopes and good internal  layout of drainage.  
Water bowls, automatic  feeders  or feed buckets  must be placed  at the 
lower  end of the sloped  floors  to ensure  that bedding  remains  dry.
2. Well ventilated  calf house. In a naturally  ventilated  calf house 
the minimum  ventilation  rate is calculated  on the basis of the stack effect  
and the maximum  rate on the wind effect. Ventilation  should  be designed 
to provide  specific  rates. It is a precise  science  and not ‘a hole, a hole 
and a hope that it will work ’. Design  data given at the end of this paper  
will ensure  an adequate  minimum  ventilation  rate per calf. Ventilation  
should  be designed  to remove  moisture  vapour  produced,  disease  organ ­
isms,  dust and foul air, and replace  them with fresh air. Ventilation  should  
also remove  by-products  such as ammonia,  hydrogen  sulphide,  carbon  
dioxide  and methane.

3. A draught  free environment  during  the winter  months. Draught  
free conditions  at calf level are achieved  by attention  to internal  details  
and studies  of internal  airflow  patterns. At the SFBIU  we are fortunate  
in having  both a water  table and a wind tunnel  for ventilation  studies.
Model  study  airflow  in two calf houses  (Mitchell  and Ross 1977)
Model studies  were carried  out to examine  the effect of pen covers 
together  with solid and open pen fronts on the air flow patterns  in two 
naturally  ventilated  calf houses. One calf house was a model of the 
SFBIU  experimental  climatic  calf house with two rows of pens and a 
central  passage.  Pen covers  were first used over the rear of the pens in 
1968 and continued  in use throughout  the work. The other  had four rows 
with two passages  and was a typical  four-row  naturally  ventilated  calf 
house. In both buildings  air inlets were below  eaves level and air outlets  
were open ridges.
The flow patterns  were based on flow in the plane of a cross section 
from right to left. This flow represented  the wind effect component  of 
natural  ventilation.  The stack effect was ignored  together  with the effect  
of heat output  from the calves.
Perspex  models  to a scale of 1:20 were used in the SFBIU  watertable  
using  an ink tracer  and the general  flow patterns  were traced. There  was 
a slight problem  of stability  with the flow patterns  which  meant  that the 
repeatability  of the patterns  had to be checked  to ensure  that the dom ­
inant pattern  was recorded.
For both buildings  the various  combinations  of pen covers  and pen 
type were examined.  From the range of combinations  used, a selection  
has been made  to illustrate  the main points  arising.
(1) Pen covers. Model  tests were carried  out for both the two-row  
and four-row  calf house  designs  with and without  pen covers  over the rear 
of the calf pens. Omitting  the pen cover  results  in a downcurrent  on the 
opposite  wall to the main air inlet and part of the primary  air flow occurs 
at calf level (Fig. 1).
The presence  of pen covers  raises the lower limit of the primary  air 
flow thereby  effectively  reducing  the air speed at calf level. Secondary,  
slower  flow occurs  beneath  the cover at calf level. In the full-scale  calf 
house this secondary  flow together  with convection  above the calves  en­
sures adequate  ventilation  at calf level.
The pen cover  has a similar  effect  when the air inlets are representing  
space boarding  or when they represent  openings  between  the pen cover 
and the eaves. The latter situation  might be used under summer  condi ­
tions if the ventilation  panels  can hinge  downwards.
(2) Solid versus  open pen fronts. Solid pen fronts also reduce  air 
speeds at calf level but do not prevent  down currents  along the walls 
(Fig. 2).
(3) Solid fronts with pen covers. In model tests where both pen 
covers  and solid fronts  are used the pen cover  tends  to have the dominant  
effect as far as raising  the primary  flow and thereby  reducing  air speed 
at calf level is concerned  (Fig. 3).
45
Fig. 1—Effect  of pen covers  on airflow
The main effect of the cover is to prevent  downcurrents  of air along 
the sides of a calf house. It is primarily  a flow director  and reduces  air 
speeds  at calf level.
There  is no need to insulate  pen covers. Erroneous  statements  regard ­
ing covers  have implied  heat conservation  but the main aim of a cover  
is airflow  direction.  There is also no need to cover any more than the 
rear 800 mm of a pen.
Temperature  patterns  recorded  from thermocouples  in the SFBIU  
climatic  calf house show that temperature  lift beneath  a cover is only 
slight  in a well ventilated  calf house  (Table  2).
In the SFBIU  climatic  calf house, air speeds at calf level did not 
exceed  0.25 m/sec  (50 ft/min)  below  the f)en covers  but speeds  up to 1.25 
m/sec  (200 ft/min)  were recorded  above  the pen covers.

Discussion
Both pen covers  and solid pen fronts have an effect on the flow pat­
tern in calf houses  and therefore  an effect on the air speed at calf level.  
The pen cover  has a more marked  effect than solid pen fronts. It is also 
interesting  to note the low air speeds recorded  at calf level during  the 
winter  months  in the SFBIU  climatic  calf house  with pen covers,  and with 
railed  rather  than solid pen fronts.
A completely  solid pen front would have a serious  disadvantage  in 
practice  as feed buckets  would have to be inside  the pen where  they can 
easily be fouled. However  partly solid pen fronts which allowed  calves  
access  to buckets  outside  the pen are possible.
If solid fien fronts  and solid pen divisions  were used, calves  would  not 
w able to see each other which is undesirable.  In certain  cases it might  
be useful to incorporate  an occasional  solid pen division,  e.g. to prevent  
cold draughts  in winter  along  the length  of a calf house. The freedom  of 
choice  regarding  solid and open pen fronts  and divisions  should  be left to 
the discretion  of the designer  concerned.  Simple  model  studies  could be 
used to indicate  the effect  of different  internal  designs.
Let us now consider  two examples  of commercial  naturally  ventilated  
calf houses. Both were designed  some years ago following  interest  by 
farmers  and are typical  of designs  produced  over the years.
Example  A. A large scale naturally  ventilated  calf house  for a farmer  
batch rearing  bought-in  calves.
Having  had experience  of rearing  calves in controlled  environment  
housing  for many years, Mr. J. McFarlane  decided  to choose  climatic  
housing  for the calf unit at Earnslaw,  Leitholm,  Berwickshire.  It has 
advantages  for calf health and management  and is less costly than con­
48
trolled  environment  housing.  The unit is in three sections : nursery,  inter ­
mediate  and follow-on.  The buildings  are straightforward  but great  
attention  has been paid to detail.
Nursery  Building
The nursery  is a long narrow  building  (Fig. 4) measuring  37.000  x 
4.870 X 2.450 m to the eaves (121 x 16 x 8 ft) with traditional  0.610 m 
(2 ft) stone  walls. It is divided  into three sections  by existing  stone walls, 
and it accommodates  84 calves  in three lots of 28 each. It used to be a 
cattle shelter  attached  to open yards. It was gutted,  the openings  were 
built up in salvaged  stone to match the existing  walls and the old low 
dilapidated  slated roof was removed  together  with its timbers,  and re­
placed  by a new roof of coloured  asbestos  on timber  trusses  and purlins.  
Replacing  the entire  roof like this allowed  the eaves height  to be raised  
to 2.450 m (8 ft) and this in turn allowed  1.000 m (3 ft 3 in) deep slatted  
boarding  to be fitted all round. This, together  with the ‘shelf formed  by 
the top of the 0.610  m (2 ft) stone  walls,  ensures  draught-free  inlet ventila ­
tion, and a 0.150  m (6 in) wide continuous  open ridge with upstands  takes  
care of the outlet ventilation.  This ridge is fitted with protective  wire 
mesh to keep out birds.
The individual  pens are 1.520 x 0.910 m (5 x 3 ft) and the divisions  
are of the open sparred  BCX^M  type (Fig. 4). There is a solid back to 
keep the calf off the wall and to prevent  the wall being soiled. The pen 
floors  have a relatively  steep slope of 0.100  in 1.520  m (4 ins in 5 ft) from  
back to front. This ensures  good drainage  and a dry bed. The pens are 
bedded  generously  with straw  twice a day. This makes  for a comfortable  
lie, and also allows  the calves  to eat a certain  amount  of straw. They are 
fed once a day, in the morning.
The nursery  building  is based on the results  of the experimental  work  
on climatic  calf housing  carried  out at the Scottish  Farm Buildings  In­
vestigation  Unit. The building  is naturally  ventilated,  the roof is unin ­
sulated  and no heat is supplied.  The idea is that if the calf has ample  
fresh air, free from draughts,  and has a dry bed, it can stand normal  
winter  temperatures  without  ill effect,  and will in fact be a healthier  and 
hardier  calf. This has been proved  in the unit at Earnslaw.  The mortality  
rate over a period  of seven  years with 4,200  calves  is below  1 %.
Pellets  are on offer after the first few days and the calves  stay in the 
nursery  section  until they are eating  2 lb per head per day (usually  at age 
four or five weeks). Then they move as a batch into four pens to the 
intermediate  building.
Intermediate  building
This is 41.150  x 12.230  x 2.720 m to eaves (135 x 40 x 9 ft) and is a 
new building  (Fig. 4) erected  alongside  the nursery  building  but spaced  
some 7.000 m (23 ft) away. It is of steel frame  construction  with 0.230  m 
(9 in) hollow  block walls and slatted  boarding  all round,  including  the 
gables. The roof is of asbestos  and there is a 0.230 (9 in) continuous  
open ridge with upstands,  again protected  with wire mesh against  birds.

The calves  stay in the intermediate  house  until they are 12 weeks  old, 
and then they move on to the follow-on  section,  which consists  of tradi ­
tional semi-open  straw bedded  courts.
Health. Health  and hygiene  are considered  to be all-important.  The 
walls are sprayed  every fortnight  against  insects. The pen divisions  are 
removed  after every batch and cleaned,  and they are re-creosoted  after  
second  batch. The house is rested for three weeks between  each batch  
and is rested  completely  from August  to October.
A very important  role is played  by the veterinary  surgeon  who sees 
every calf the day after arrival  and there-after  inspects  them once a week.
Labour. The calf unit is run by one man.
Costs. The unit was erected  in 1971 for a gross cost of £11,000,  in­
cluding  demolition  of old buildings,  making  up of site, hardcore  road ­
ways,  and all fixtures  and fittings.
Example  B. A naturally  ventilated  calf house with monopitch  roof 
for a farmer  rearing  home  reared  calves.
Accommodation  was required  by Thornton  Farms  Limited,  Mains  of 
Thornton,  Laurencekirk,  Kincardineshire  for calves  from the dairy herd 
up to four or six months  of age. Cows  were calved  from October  through  
to June mainly  in existing  boxes and at three days the calves would  be 
moved  to the calf house. After discussions  between  the estate  factor,  farm  
manager,  farm building  and veterinary  specialists  and advisers,  the design  
was developed  from the requirements  which  were formulated  at this early  
stage. Visits were made to a number  of calf houses  on other farms,  and 
full account  was taken  of current  research  and development  work on calf 
housing  in the UK.
Basic  requirements
It was decided  that the design  must meet the following  requirements :
1. Accommodation  for 108 calves with ages ranging  from three days 
to six months  at any one time.
2. Individual  penning  for the first two weeks.
3. Potential  for isolation  of groups  or individuals  within  the building.
4. Good  ventilation.
5. A dry bed for all calves.
6. Good  day lighting  and maximum  penetration  of sunlight.
7. Unobstructed  observation  of all calves.
8. Good access  for under-cover  feeding  and general  management.
9. Easily  cleaned  internal  surfaces  at calf level.
10. Easy removal  of muck  by mechanical  means.
11. Three  additional  loose boxes.
12. A feed storage  and preparation  area.
The building
A site was chosen  for a new calf house separate  from existing  tradi ­
tional buildings  and from both foot and wheeled  traffic  associated  with 
older  cattle. It could thus be managed  in isolation  if required.  The loca­
51
tion was in close proximity  to the manager ’s house to encourage  both 
routine  and casual  visits for observation,  and it was convenient  for veter ­
inary  visits and treatment  without  passage  through  other buildings.
It was decided  to use a tethered  feed fence to provide  individual  
accommodation  for calves  during  the first two weeks  in this building.  The 
tethered  feed fence was fitted with milk containers  and rubber teats 
instead  of buckets  in order  to ensure  that the calves  received  milk through  
a teat before moving  to group pens and automatic  feeders. Access  to 
calves  for insjjection  and attention  is much  easier  in a tethered  feed fence  
than in individual  pens and the veterinary  practitioner  supported  this 
view. Details  of the tethered  feed fence were published  (Mitchell,  1972)  
and are also available  as a detailed  drawing.  Calves  would  then be trans ­
ferred  to group  pens and fed by an automatic  machine  until weaning.
The building  (Fig. 5) has a linear  plan. The feed pass, which  is 1.400  
m wide, gives covered  access  to all sections  and to the feed store and pre­
paration  area. A monopitch  roof with the building  facing south-west  
allows  maximum  penetration  of sunlight,  and rooflights  give good day­
lighting  to all parts of the building.  Natural  ventilation  is provided  by an 
opening  beneath  the eaves along the length  of the passage  at the back,  
space boarded  to prevent  strong through-draughts,  and an open front  
which  acts as both an air inlet and outlet. The sheeted  front gates give 
good shelter  to lying animals  in the open-fronted  sections.  Again  model  
studies  were used to ensure  a draught  free internal  environment.
Each section  is divided  off by a partition  of cement  rendered  block- 
work  to a height  of 1.5 m and flat asbestos  on timber framing  above. This 
prevents  facial contact  between  calves in different  sections.  Initially  it 
was planned  to have doors in the passage  between  the separate  sections

to prevent  through-draughts.  Then it was felt that they would hinder  
movement  between  sections  so it was decided  to leave them out unless 
they proved  necessary.
A dry bed was known  to be very important  in all types  of calf housing. 
This is provided  by straw bedding  on 100 mm thick concrete  floors,  with 
a damp  proof  membrane,  laid to falls of approximately  1:20 away from  
the centre  of the pens. This ensures  that any free liquid —urine or spillage 
from drinkers  and feeders —drains  quickly  out of the pens. Straw  usage 
is then minimised  with maximum  calf comfort. The loose boxes are 
drained  separately  from the rest of the building.  The roof is corrugated  
asbestos  cement  sheeting  on steel Z-purlins  supported  by a steel frame. 
No roof insulation  is necessary  in this type of freely ventilated  building  
for calves. There is 3.4 m clear headroom  at the front for mucking  out 
by tractor.
Operation
(1) Calf health and performance.  Approximately  324 calves have 
been reared in this building  from three days of age to five months  at the 
time of writing. Calf health and performance  have been very good. 
Young  calves settled in quickly  and suffered  no appreciable  check on 
sei>aration  from their dams. There has been a complete  absence  of 
respiratory  stress  even at very low temperatures  with high external  winds. 
Observations  by the veterinary  adviser  by day and night showed  rectal  
temperatures,  posture  and behaviour  to be normal  under all conditions.  
General  health and growth  rates have been good and veterinary  costs 
minimal.  Only four calves  have died to date.
Relative  to external  conditions  the building  gives protection  from  
direct precipitation,  provides  a dry bed, and reduces  air velocity  at calf 
level. An open-fronted  monopitch  design  is very unusual  in the north ­
east of Scotland  and it is interesting  to observe  its success  under  severe  
weather  conditions.
(2) Access. The clear passage  width of 1.400 m has been appreci ­
ated by the stockmen  for ease of movement  and feeding. Opening  and 
closing  of doors in the passage  between  sections  would have been a 
nuisance.  Experience  to date and subsequent  model  studies  in the SFBIU  
water table have shown that draughts  were unlikely  to be created  by 
omitting  the doors. Tractor  access  for muck removal  is excellent.
(3) Partitions.  Soft asbestos  panels  were used above  the 1.5 m high 
cement  plastered  blockwork  partitions  between  sections  because  they were  
cheaper  than infilling  completely  with blockwork.  It has been found  that 
calves  are able to reach up and damage  the panels. An extra two courses  
of blocks,  giving  a blockwork  height  of 1.9 m would  have prevented  this.
(4) Flexibility.  The building  is extremely  flexible  in use and spare  
sections  have been used for a variety  of purposes  including  holding  adult  
cows, barley  beef animals  during  the summer  months,  and even machin ­
ery storage. All internal  partitions  are non-load-bearing  and could be 
removed  at a future  date should  a complete  change  of use be required.
53
In both examples  given it is not necessary  to adjust  the building  for 
surnmer  or winter  ventilation.  Space boarding  being fixed is better  than 
a hinged  inlet baffle which may require  adjustment.  In order to reduce  
labour  requirement  demountable  pens are used and tractor  access  is pro­
vided to allow  muck  removal  by tractor  and foreloader.
Basic  layout  and design  check  list
Basic data for calves  up to 12 weeks  of age are given below  together  
with a design  check  list.
Penspace
Age Minimum  space required  per calf
Individual  pens Up to 4 weeks 1.1 m' (1.5 X 0.75 m)
12.5 ft" (5 ft X 2 ft 6 in)
Up to 8 weeks 1.8 mMl.8  X 1.0 m)
19.5 fF (6 ft X 3 ft 3 in)
Group  pens Up to 8 weeks 1.1 m'^ (12.5 ft")
Up to 12 weeks 1.5 m- (16.5 ft-)
Passage  width. Two rows of pens —one on each side of a central  
passage  1.200  m (4 ft).
Single  row of pens on one side of a passage  1.000 m (3 ft 3in). 
Water. Individually  penned —one water  bucket  for each {ten.
Group  penned —one water  bowl for every 10-12 calves.
Trough  frontage.  Feeding  space  for individually  fed calves —350 mm 
(1 ft 2 in) per calf.
Floor  design. Beneath  straw bedding  provide  concrete  floors with a 
slope of at least 1 in 20. Passages  should  be domed  and the floor slope  
in feed storage  areas should  be 1 in 40.
Environmental  requirements
1. Cubic  air capacity  when fully stocked  6 m’/calf (212 ftVcalf).
2. Ventilation.  With eaves  level air inlets  and ridge  outlets  allow  an inlet 
area of 0.045 mV  calf (0.5 fp/calf),  an outlet  area of 0.04 mV  calf (0.4 
ftVcalf)  and 1.5 -2.5 m (5-8 ft) height  difference  between  the two. 
If pens are arranged  along  the sides of a naturally  ventilated  building,  
then a cover  should  be placed  over the rear part of the pen to prevent  
incoming  air from dropping  onto the calves. If fans have to be used 
design  on a basis of 35-105  m’/h (20 - 62 ft^/min)  {>er calf.
Air movement  rate close to the calf, not more than 0.25 m/s (50 ft/ 
min) in winter.
Relative  humidity  and temperature.  No specific  requirements  under  
UK conditions.  Satisfactory  if similar  to outside  conditions.
Insulation  not required.

Ensure  that the following  points  have been clarified  in the final design 
by checking  with the design  data above  or by referring  to Mitchell,  1976.  
The most common  faults  occur  in these aspects.
Drainage.  Are floor slopes  adequate  in pens, passages,  feed storage  
and preparation  area? Are liquids  led out of the building  without  fouling  
working  areas,  without  passing  through  calf pens?
Natural  ventilation.  Is the total air inlet area adequate?  Is the total 
air outlet  area adequate?  Are the inlets  well distributed?  Will the calves 
be free from draughts?
Mechanical  ventilation.  Use manual  NOT thermostatic  fan controls.  
Is fan capacity  adequate  at the working  back pressure?  Is the air inlet 
area adequate?  Are the inlets well distributed?  Will the controls  ensure  
that the ventilation  rate will not go below  the minimum  required?  Will 
the calves  be free from draughts?
Materials  handling.  Is the size of the feed storage  and preparation  
area adequate?  Is it positioned  well in relation  to the calf pens? Can 
bedding  and muck be easily  brought  in and removed  from the building?
Details  are given in the ‘Calf Housing  Handbook ’ by Dan Mitchell,  
available  from the Scottish  Farm Buildings  Investigation  Unit, Craib-  
stone, Buckburn,  Aberdeen.  Price £2.00 paperback  or £3.00 hardback  
(post paid).
Summary
In the design  of calf housing  it is essential  to formulate  a detailed  out­
line of the housing  requirements  at the outset  whether  planning  housing  
for home reared or bought-in  calves. By consideration  of the design 
requirement  and eurrently  available  design  data it is possible  to produce  
low cost naturally  ventilated  calf houses  which  will ensure  successful  calf 
rearing  provided  management  and nutrition  are also adequate.

The Influence  of Management  and 
Feeding  Practices  on Calf Performance
R. J. FALLON
Agricultural Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Introduction
A calf rearing  programme  must contain  a management  and feeding  sys­
tem which  minimises  incidence  of disease  and the risk of calf deaths,  and 
simultaneously  provide  satisfactory  calf liveweight  gain. In this paper,  
a number of  factors  which  influence  calf performance  while  it is dependent  
on a liquid  diet are discussed.
Colostrum
A survey  of 1,250 calves purchased  direct from farms or from calf 
auction  marts for Grange  over the last four years showed  that 40% had 
inadequate  blood serum antibody  levels when purchased.  It was shown 
that low antibody  levels  were associated  with increased  rates of mortality  
(Table 1). Blood serum immunoglobulin  (Ig) level of 15-20  ZST units  
provides  moderate  protection.  However,  levels  in excess  of 20 ZST units  
are more desirable.

The low immunoglobulin  levels  obtained  could be due to : —
Weak  calf unable  to suckle  sufficiently  soon after birth.
Calf unable  to suckle  from a cow which  has a pendulous  udder.
Cow may not permit  calf to suckle.
Farmer  may not allow calf to suckle dam and may neglect  to feed 
sufficient  colostrum  to the calf in the first 6 - 12 hrs of life.
Cow may be milked  immediately  after calving  or have leaked  milk 
before  calving  so that the colostrum  available  to the calf is low in 
immunoglobulins.
The calf ’s ability  to injest  sufficient  immunoglobulin  is dependent  on •
(a) the amount  fed— minimum  of 4 kg for a 40 kg calf within 12 hrs of birth;
57
(b) the concentration  of immunoglobulin  in the colostrum  fed—the mean  
immunoglobulin  values  for first, second  and third milkings  after calv­
ing are 11.5, 6.0 and 2.5 gms/ 100 ml respectively;
(c) time of feeding —the calf’s ability  to absorb  the immunoglobulin  frac­
tion of colostrum  has decreased  by half between  birth and 16 hrs and 
has practically  stopped  at 24 hrs after birth.
Ideally,  the calf should  be afforded  the opportunity  to injest its first 
feed of colostrum  from its dam within  6 hrs of birth. This means  that 
the calf should  be assisted  in suckling.  However,  it may be necessary  to 
augment  this suckling  with artificial  feeding  of the colostrum  in parti ­
cular cases.
The alternative  is to artificially  feed the calf first milking  colostrum  
in two feeds, the first feed 4 - 6 hrs after birth and the second  4 - 6 hrs 
later. The calf should  be fed to appetite  with colostrum  that has been 
reheated  to blood temperature.  The calf’s intake from two feeds is 
approximately  10% of calf body weight  and this should  provide  most  
calves  with adequate  antibody  protection  (Table  2).

Calf type
Studies  over a three year period  at Grange  have shown  a positive  rela­
tionship  between  weight of calf at purchase  and subsequent  survival 
(Table  3). These  results  indicate  that in order to minimise  loses, particu ­
larly when large numbers  are being  purchased,  the stronger/heavier  type 
of calf must be bought.  This type is also likely  to be older.
When the price paid for calves  at auction  markets  is examined,  it is 
found  that the price paid is related  to size of calf (Table  4).

The purchaser  at the auction  mart pays a higher  price for the older  
heavier  calf. Therefore  it will be in the producer ’s interest  to keep the 
calf on the home farm for the first 2 to 3 weeks  so that it will be at least 
45 kg at time of sale. Such a calf should  present  minimum  rearing  prob ­
lems for the purchaser.  A three week old calf should  logically  cost £ 10- 
El 5 more than a calf less than one week old due to : 
a) Saving  to purchaser  of three week old calf :

Production  targets
The targets  for calf growth  in artificial  rearing  are given in Table 5. 
These targets  are readily  attainable  and when they are not achieved  the 
calf rearing  system  should  be analysed  with particular  reference  to feed 
inputs  and incidence  of disease. The calf, in order to attain  these target  
weight  gains (Table  5), will require  20 - 25 kg of milk replacer  and 80 - 100 
kg of calf concentrates.

The feeding  schedule  in Table  6 will provide  the necessary  feed inputs  
to attain  the above  target  weights.

These feed inputs may be increased  to provide  greater  initial live- 
weight  gains. Table 7 shows the liveweight  gains which were obtained  
when  25, 37 and 50 kg of milk replacer  were fed over a 7 - 56 day period  
at Grange.  However,  the medium  and high planes  of nutrition  in Table  7 
have a number  of disadvantages :
a) greater  incidence  of scour  and risk of higher  mortality;  
higher  inputs  of milk replacer;  
lower  intakes  of concentrates;
greater  risk of over-feeding,  namely  a severe  digestive  upset  occurring  
when calf is placed  on the high feeding  initially.

Effect  of management  practices  on calf performance  
on automatic  feeders
Recent  research  on automatic  calf feeders  at Grange  shows  that dif­
ferent  methods  of introducing  calves  to the automatic  feeder  did not affect  
subsequent  calf performance  (Table  9).

Preparing  the calf for the automatic  feeder  by pail or nipple  feeding  
for seven days prior to introduction  on to feeder  did not improve  calf 
performance  and would  not be advocated  as a routine  practice.
A second  experiment  showed  that by increasing  the concentration  of 
milk replacer  fed from the feeder,  when  the calves  were first introduced  to 
the feeder,  resulted  in seven  deaths  out of 40 calves  (Table  10).
When  the calves  were fed from an automatic  feeder  which  dispersed  
a 20% solution  of milk replacer  (1 kg in 5 litres of water),  the treatment  
had to be discontinued  after three days because  of illness  and deaths. It 
was concluded  that the initial  concentration  of 20% is unsuitable  where 
bought-in  calves  were first introduced  to the automatic  feeder. It is there ­
fore not recommended.

Another  experiment  at Grange  examined  the effect of weaning  calves 
abruptly  off an automatic  feeder  when they had consumed  either 30 kg 
or 50 kg milk replacer.  Weaning  off the feeder  when  the calves  consumed  
30 kg of milk replacer  resulted  in a severe check in growth  rate after 
weaning  (Table  11), due to low concentrate  consumption  before  weaning. 
The average  daily concentrate  consumption  for the seven days before 
weaning  was only 0.1 kg per day for the calves  weaned  when fed 30 kg 
of milk replacer  compared  to 0.4 kg per day for the calves  weaned  when 
fed 50 kg of milk replacer.

Automatic  calf feeders  reduce  the labour  inputs  required  in calf rear­
ing and allow for redeployment  of farm labour. However,  the use of 
automatic  calf feeders  requires  vigilant  stockmanship  by the operator.
Automatic  feeder —critical  management  aspects
* Daily  intake  of milk replacer  by the calf is not controlled.
* Bought-in  calves are liable to overfeed  when first introduced  to the 
feeder.
* Avoid  mixing  very young  calves  with 4 - 5 week old calves,  particu ­
larly on dairy farms.
* Calf fed on automatic  feeder  requires  40 - 50 kg of milk replacer.
62
* Calves  on automatic  feeders  have a loose faeces  due to high input of 
milk replacer.
* There  is difficulty  in getting  some calves  which  are on ad libitum  milk 
to eat sufficient  concentrates  before  weaning.
Cost of calf rearing —7-84 days
Costs are summarised  as follows :
System 1 : Pail feeding  7-75 days— input of 25 kg of milk replacer  and 
95 kg of calf concentrate.  Liveweight  gain 0.60 kg/day.
System  2: Automatic  feeding  7 - 63 days —input of 50 kg of milk re­
placer  and 53 kg of calf concentrate.  Liveweight  gain 0.65

Factors  Affectinjj;  Milk Yield per Cow
P. A. GLEESON
Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
Milk yield per cow is of critical  importance  in defining  farm income  on a 
well stocked  dairy farm. Optimum  dairy farm management  however  re­
quires both high stocking  rate and high milk yield per cow. These  dual 
objectives  can be obtained  at the same time and they are not antagonistic  
to each other. It is easier  to increase  stocking  rate on dairy farms  than to 
increase  milk yield per cow. The discussion  on increasing  milk yield per 
cow in Ireland  has been mainly  in terms of animal  breeding  and feeding.  
While these factors  are important,  they are only two of the many herd 
management  details  which  determine  milk yield per cow within  herds.
The factors affecting  cow milk yield are best presented  within the 
three categories  shown  in Table 1. The first factor,  potential  of the cow, 
is mainly  influenced  by breeding,  size and age at first calving.  Effects  of 
breeding  both from the male and female  side will not be discussed  in this 
paper.  Size and age at first calving  are important  determinants  in influenc ­
ing both first lactation  yields and possibly  have major  influences  on the 
life time performance  of the animal.
The management  of the dairy  cow during  the lactation and  dry periods  
will be discussed  under  the influence  of feeding,  time of calving  and lac­
tation  number.  However,  two other  factors  are important,  namely,  disease  
control  during  the season  and good milking  management.
The rate of culling  and degree  of mortality  in herds  have a big impact  
on output  from dairy herds. Culling  is influenced  by the number  of herd 
replacements  available  in the herd, the disease  state of the herd and the 
fertility  of the herd. These  three factors  determine  the rate at which  cull­
ing takes place in the herd in any one year.

Trends  in milk yields  and stocking  rate on Irish dairy  farms
In recent times it appeared  that milk yield per cow was increasing. 
However  the more recent statistics  indicate  that the national  yield per 
cow is still less than 600 gallons. This has been confirmed  in a recent  
survey  (Table  2) on a national  basis. The average  yield per cow was 579 
gallons.  There  was however,  a higher  milk yield in the Munster  area, the 
traditional  dairying  area of the country,  but even in that province  average 
milk yield per cow was only 623 gallons.  A further  disconcerting  feature  
emerging  from this survey  is the low average  stocking  rate of approxi-  
mately  two forage  acres per livestock  unit. It is against  this background  
that I propose  to deal with some aspects  which influence  milk yield per 
cow.

Weight  at first calving
There is little information  available  on the optimum  weight  to calve 
down two year old heifers  and its effect on subsequent  lactations.  An 
experiment  is presently  in progress  at the Agricultural  Institute  Field  
Station,  Ballyragget,  Co. Kilkenny,  where two year old Friesian  spring  
calving  heifers  were divided  into four treatment  groups  to compare  the 
effect of weight  at first calving  on lactation  performance.  Two groups  had 
a target weight  of 1,000 lbs weight  before calving  and were stocked  at 
0.95 and 0.75 acres/animal  after calving. The other two groups  had a 
target weight of 1,150 lbs before calving and were also stocked at 
0.95 and 0.75 acres per cow after calving.  These stocking  rates provide 
grazing  and silage requirements.  The heifers were fed grass silage  
ad libitum  and 12 lbs concentrates/head/day  after calving  until trans ­
ferred to grass in mid-March.  The groups  are rotationallly  grazed  on 
pasture  and 75% of each farmlet  is conserved  for winter  feed.
The average  performance  in the first two lactations  is presented  in 
Table  3.
Since this is a long term study caution  must be observed  in drawing  
conclusions  at this stage. The heavier  animals  in the first lactation  had an 
increased  milk production  of approximately  100 gallons  per heifer. The 
first lactations  in 1976 coincided  with a very dry summer.  This resulted  
in the animals  being in poor body weight  at the end of the first lactation.  
The pre-calving  weights  of all groups  in 1977, start off the second  lacta ­
tion, were only at the same level as at the beginning  of the first lactation.

This had a large influence  on milk yields in the second  lactation  and, in 
some treatments,  it depressed  lactation  yields in the second  year from 
those obtained  in the first lactations.  Those  treatment  groups  with poor  
lactations  in 1977 tended  to compensate  in body weight  and resulted  in 
very good body weight  conditions  at the end of the 1977 lactation  year. 
This increase  in bodyweight  could  have a major  influence  in the lactations  
(third)  at the beginning  of 1978. The only conclusions  one can draw from  
this experiment  at this early stage are: (1) the heavier  the heifer  at first 
calving,  the higher  the milk yield; (2) if animals  are not given an oppor ­
tunity to increase  body condition  between  the first and second  calvings 
milk yield can be depressed  in the second  lactation  and (3) animals  tend 
to gain extra weight  during  the second  lactation  at the expense  of milk 
production.

dicate  the relative  importance  of the components  of a dairy cow ’s diet. 
It is worth noting  that the cost of energy  as expressed  in digestible  dry

Pre-calving  feeding
Body  reserves  built up during  the dry period  can be utilised  to support  
milk production  in early lactation.  During  the last eight  weeks  Preceedmg 
parturition,  a liveweight  gain of 1.5 lbs per day is desirable  An outl ne 
of how these levels  of gam can be attained  with various  levels  of feeds  
illustrated  in Table 5. These figures  are only a guideline  and show how 
the type and quantity  of roughage  fed, influence  the level of concentra  
feeding  required  with poor quality  feeds. These  figures  are based  on cows  
weighing  10 cwts and a silage  with a dry matter  of 20

The figures  show that increasing  the concentrate  level results  in a de­
pression  of silage intake by the dairy cow. This table also shows the 
degree  to which  body condition  or bodyweight  loss can influence  the milk 
pr^uction  obtained  per cow at various  feeding  levels Thus,  as concen ­
trate feeding  levels increase,  there is a reduction  in silage intake an in­
crease  in milk production  and a decrease  in bodyweight  loss by the cow.
68
Silage  quality  and milk yield
Silage  quality  is influenced  by the quality  of the material  ensiled,  and 
the efficiency  of preservation.  Voluntary  intakes  of silage  conserved  “Om 
poor quality  material  or which are poorly  preserved  are very low and 
large inputs  of concentrates  are required  to supplement  low intakes.  Table  
7 illustrates  the level of concentrates  required  for varying  milk production  
levels depending  on silage quality.  The additional  concentrates  required  
with poor quality  silage  in order  to achieve  the same level of milk  produc ­
tion as with good silage is about 8 lb per cow per day. Over a winter  
period  this can amount  to £33 per cow.

A guideline  to the possible  levels  of concentrates  to be fed after calv­
ing to spring  calving  cows in 1978 is shown  in Table  8. The figures  show  
that as the level of feeding  increases  the response  to extra coricentrates  
decreases  when measured  over the full lactation.  With a possible  price 
of 50p per gallon  for milk in 1978 and the concentrates  costing  £120 per 
ton, the economic  level of concentrate  feeding  with good silage should  
be between  15 - 16 lb per cow per day.

Effect  of wilting  on silage  quality
Table 9 shows that wilting  resulted  in increased  silage dry matter  
intakes  and reduced  body weight  losses. However,  there was very little 
effect on milk yield per cow in this experiment.

Concentrate  feeding  on grass
There  is very little limited  information  in the influence  of concentrate  
feeding  on pasture  in early spring. This type of experimentation  is diffi­
cult because  the conditions  vary as grass growth  improves  with the ad­
vancing  season and the need for supplementation  generally  decreases.  
The Moorepark  recommendations  have been to feed the same quantity  of 
concentrates  for the first two weeks  after turnout  as were fed during  the 
indoor  period. The level of feeding  should  then be reduced  by half for 
the next ten days and phased  out completely,  with the exception  of a 
small quantity  of meals  to carry calcined  magnesite  until the end of May.
An experiment  was carried  out in 1977 when concentrates  were fed 
from March  21st to May 25th as follows :
(i) no supplementation;
(ii) 10 lbs molasses  per head per day;
(iii) 7 lbs barley  per head per day.
The cows were stocked  at 0.7 acres per cow for a 63 day feeding  period.  
The mean  calving  date of this herd was January  20th. Difficulty  was ex­
perienced  in getting  the cows to eat their respective  quantity  of feeds and 
in the molasses  group  some barley  was introduced  to entice  them to take 
their ration. Over the total period  the quantities  of feed consumed  were  
approximately  half of their allotted  allowance.  However,  the quantities  
consumed  did not influence  either  milk yield or body weight  during  the 
experimental  period.
A similar  type experiment  was carried  out from July 29th to Novern-  
ber 25th, 1976 when  cows were stocked  at 0.8 acre per cow. This experi ­
ment consisted  of three treatment  groups :
(i) control  with no feed;
(ii) 10 lbs molasses/head/day;
(iii) 7.5 lbs barley -t-2 lbs of soyabean  per head per day.
The objective  was to determine  the effects of supplementary  feeding  in 
the latter part of lactation.  The animals  on trial were milking  over 2j
70
gallons  when introduced  to their feed. The supplemented  groups in­
creased  milk production  over the control  groups  but there was no dif­
ference  between  the two types of supplementation.  The control  group  
produced  less milk and had a shorter  lactation  length.  However,  one could  
not economically  justify  this supplementation  at the end of the lactation.  
Further  studies  on this subject  are proposed.
The influence  of stocking  rate on dairy  merit
It was stated earlier  that high stocking  rate and high milk yield per 
COW were not incompatable.  The results  from an experiment  which  has 
been carried  out for three years  at the Curtin's  farm at Moorepark  demon ­
strating  stocking  rate and dairy merit  are shown  in Table 10.

Concentrates  High merit  8.5 cwt
Low merit  6.5 cwt
This experiment  involves  four groups  of animals,  two highly  selected 
groupis  and two groups  whose yields are close to the national  average. 
Within  each selection,  cows are stocked  at either  one acre per cow or 0.8 
acres per cow. The results  show that at one cow per acre with an input  
of over 8 cwts concentrates  it is possible  to achieve  close to 1,000 gallons  
per cow and per acre. Increasing  stocking  rate from 1 to 0.8 has depressed  
milk production  in both the high and low merit cows. This has been a 
feature  of stocking  rate work in recent  years which may well be associ ­
ated with the dry summers  experienced  in 1976 and 1977. These  depres ­
sions would  justify  increasing  stocking  rates to high levels at the present  
time. The proportion  of yield produced  Indoors  reflects  the overall  lacta ­
tion yields in the high merit cows. A useful  guide to early calving  is the 
percentage  of milk produced  between  calving  and the end of May which  
has been approximately  54% in this experiment.  This result emphasises  
the value  of early calving,  good quality  winter  feed with supplementation,  
and very good grassland  management  in the early part of the season. 
One further  pioint illustrated  by the result is the need for a long lactation  
in order  to obtain  high milk yields.
71
The influence  of early calving  is further endorsed  by the data presented 
in Table 11. These  data are taken  from some of the Moorepark  herds  and 
illustrate  that late calving  decreases  milk yield per cow and lactation  
length. When  the January  and April yields  are compared  there is a drop  
of 38 gallons  per month  for each months  delay in calving  date. The data 
from An Foras Taluntais  survey  of 700 farms in 1976 indicate  the effect  
of early calving  on milk yield as shown  in Table 12.

Control  of culling  in dairy  herds
Data from eight herds in Moorepark  were used to establish  average  
values for culling  and mortality  and to indicate  those factors  requiring  
particular  attention  in order to eliminate  mortality  and involuntary  cull­
ing. The data are based  on a period  covering  six years  from 1969 to 1975.  
Of the results  for culling  only those  cows culled  for ‘low milk production ’ 
or 'late calving ’ may be classified  as ‘voluntary  culling ’, i.e. 2.8 in the 
total culling  rate of 19.8. High losses  of animals  due to involuntary  cull­
ing will consistently  reduce  the possibility  of improving  herd milk yields 
by reducing  the number  of cows that can be culled on low yield. The 
major  cause  of involuntary  culling  is infertility.  This factor  accounted  for 
39.3%  of all culled  cows or 7.8% of all cows. The factors  that contribute  
to infertility  have been shown  to be mainly  due to repeat breeders. In 
addition,  up to 10% of cows culled  for infertility  may in fact be in calf. 
Furthermore,  the late calvers  may not have been offered  for service  for 
more than one or two services,  and this will contribute  to the number  
culled  as being  infertile  within  a compact  calving  season.  The culling rates  
indicated  in Table 14 are similar  to those obtained  by K. J. O’Farrell  (An 
Foras  Taluntais,  Moorepark)  in a recent  survey  of dairy farms  in the Fer­
moy area.

The key factor  for early compact  calving  is good heat detection.  An 
outline  of the number  of observations  required  for good heat detection  
is shown  in Table 15. Studies  at Moorepark  have shown  that the average  
duration  of heat is quite short. Over 33% of heats are less than 6 hours  
in duration,  and cows can come on heat for short periods  several  times a 
day. Thus, the importance  of frequent  heat observations  during  the day 
cannot  be over-emphasised.

Number  of replacement  heifers
The high incidence  of involuntary  culling  has allowed  very low culling 
rates of low milk producers  in Irish dairy herds. Between  18 and 20% 
of cows are culled  annually  and mostly  for reasons  other  than yield. The 
recent  figures  for replacement  heifers  from the Central  Statistic  s Office  
indicate  that the number  of in-calf  heifers  being reared is considerably  
less than 20% of the national  herd. This may have major implications  
with the eradication  of brucellosis  in the future because  present  culling 
rates on an involuntary  basis will not allow for replacement  of those  ani­
mals being  culled  for brucellosis.  If the two problems  of eliminating  low 
yielders  by the introduction  of additional  replacement  heifers and the 
eradication  of brucellosis  are introduced  to farms,  then increased  num ­
bers of heifers  must be reared. The question  then arises : where  do these 
come from?
Table 16 presents  two possible  replacement  policies.  The first example  
is a 100 cow herd in which  the cows are put in calf to dairy sires and the 
heifers  at the 20% replacement  rate are put in calf to beef type bulls,  such 
as the Angus  for easy calving.  After allowing  for mortality  and animals  
not going in calf there is a maximum  of 31 calves  available  as replace ­
ment heifers.  But these heifer  calves  could  have been born between  Janu ­
ary and July, thus making  compact  calving  for heifers  impossible  if the 
maximum  number  of animals  are selected.
In the second  example  both the heifers  (if they are bred from high- 
yielding  cows and nominated  sires they should  be good genetic  material)  
and dairy cows are bred to dairy sires. The number  of possible  heifer  
replacements  is increased  to 39 heifers  from 100 animals.  The table clearly 
outlines  the type of strategies  which must be considered  if \ve are to in­
crease the culling  for low yielders,  eradication  of brucellosis  and T.B., 
and expand  the national  herd.
Summary
In this paper a number  of factors  that affect milk yield per cow have 
been considered.  Increased  milk yields  per cow will be obtained  by breed-

ing which is long term in nature. Increasing  the weight  at first calving 
has a large influence  on initial milk yields and may have effects  on the 
total life-time  performance  of the animal. The important  management  
factors  to increase  milk yields per cow depend  on better feeding,  early  
calving,  developing  a mature  herd, good disease  control  and efficient  
milking  management.  Finally,  to allow milk yields to increase,  both 
culling  and mortality  must be improved  in all herds. The factor  of high 
infertility  alone which accounts  for between  7 to 10% of all cows in the 
country  being culled annually  will demand  greater  attention  from dairy  
farmers  in the future. It is only by selecting  more replacement  heifers 
and heifers  of high quality  that higher  milk yield per cow can be achieved.

Managing  and Motivating  the 
Dairy Worker
M. F. SEABROOK
School  of Agriculture,  University  of Nottingham.
I. Introduction
Agriculturalists  are often complacent  about  man management  because  of 
a feeling  that agricultural  workers  are more satisfied  than their industrial  
counterparts.  However,  there is growing  evidence  that this is probably  
not true and it is the deferential  position  of agricultural  workers  which  
prevents  the full expression  of their dissatisfaction  in agriculture.  The gap 
in life styles between  employer  and employee  is all too often ignored  in 
agriculture  but it is likely  in the future  to be a cause  of friction  and unrest.
The general  objective  of this paper is to discuss  man management  in 
agricultural  activities  in order to achieve  more effective  worker  perfor ­
mance. The basic theme is that men have needs,  some common  to all, 
some more specific,  and that successful  management  and motivation  is 
concerned  with identifying  these needs and providing  the right mix of 
rewards  to enable  the worker  to fulfill these needs inside  and outside  his 
work situation.
II. Definitions
A. Job Satisfaction.  A feeling  of positive  effect : produced  by satisfac ­
tion of important  needs; in conjunction  with a feeling  that these  
needs could not have been better  or more easily satisfied  in a com­
parable  job; such perceptions  being with respect  to the job as a 
whole,  i.e. satisfaction  results  from need fulfilment.
B. Job Enrichment.  Adding  additional  elements  to the job to make it 
more demanding  and rewarding;  filling higher  needs and arousing  
human  needs.
C. Motivation.  The instigation  and direction  of behaviour  aimed at 
satisfying  a need. Motivation  is the drive or urge to behave  in a cer­
tain way; the driving  force to act in a particular  manner  in order to 
achieve  certain  ends or objectives.  One may regard  motivated  be­
haviour  as extending  between  two poles.
In order to understand  motivated  behaviour  one has to consider :
a) Which  goals and outcomes  are sought  by an individual  (i.e. what  
needs  is one seeking  to satisfy).
b) What are the factors  influencing  this choice  for the individual.
c) What determines  the behaviour  a person  will be motivated  to 
adopt in order to reach the goals and outcomes  thought  desir ­
able.
D. Intrinsic  Work Factors.  Factors  associated  with the nature  of work  
itself,  e.g. feelings  of achievement,  responsibility,  recognition.
E. Extrinsic  Work Factors. Factors  associated  with the environment  
in which  the job operates,  e.g. pay and working  conditions.
77
111. The needs  of man
In order to effectively  manage  and motivate  the worker  one needs to 
consider  the motivation  and needs  of individual  members  of staff. There  
is no easy blue print to managing  staff. Attention  needs to be paid to 
individual  differences  and not to assume  all employees  want and react to 
the same thing,  since behaviour  is related  to the fulfilment  of needs.
Maslow,  A. H. put forward  a theory  of the hierarchy  of human  needs. 
He advanced  the concept  of five basic categories  of human  needs being 
of varying  degrees  of potency.  He asserts  as a general  principle  that the 
satisfaction  of each group  of needs is a prerequisite  to the experience  of 
the next group of needs in the hierarchy,  hence ungratified  needs moti ­
vate.
Biological  needs (the most basic needs). These may be collectively 
described  as the need to survive : the need for fresh air for food,  drink,  
warmth,  sex, etc. They are provided  for through  the medium  of eco­
nomic  rewards  in more advanced  societies.  Such basic needs  must be 
satisfied  before  a person  is motivationally  aware  of the next group  of 
needs  —
Safety  and security  needs. In the work  situation,  these needs  are mani ­
fest in a preoccupation  with redundancy,  the maintenance  of pay dif­
ferentials,  the provision  of pensions  and, particularly  in agriculture,  
security  of tenure  in farm cottages.  Once they are satisfied  attention  
is turned  to —
The need for affection.  This social  need derives  from the pleasure  of 
associating  with others,  of belonging  to a group  and conforming  to its 
rules and conventions.  The implications  for management  will concern  
the leadership  processes  of the working  group. Following  the satis­
faction  of such needs  attention  turns to —
The need  for esteem.  Maslow  distinguishes  two classes  of needs  within 
this category —firstly  the need for achievement,  for independence  and 
for a sense of personal  worth,  all of which may be described  as the 
need for self-esteem.  Secondly  there is the desire for the esteem  of 
others;  the need to earn a reputation,  to experience  recognition  and 
appreciation  in one ’s achievements.  Providing  satisfaction  of these  
psychological  needs is a most important  part of motivational  policy 
in any business.  The drive  to fulfill  these  needs  may mean  that people 
reject their working  groups  and would rather work alone than as a 
member  of a group. If fulfilled,  the person  will then become  aware  
and finally  require  fulfilment  of his —
Self-actualisation  needs. This is the highest  level of human  needs in 
the hierarchy  and in a job sense is reached  by only the fortunate  few. 
It is the need of a man to become  everything  of which  he is capable.  
The provision  of a work environment  is which each individual  may 
aspire  to his full potential  is the challenge  it gives to Management.
The general  pattern  of needs is consistent  person  to person  but these  
needs are in turn modified  by such factors  as personality,  age and up­
bringing.
78
There  are many  other  theories  of human  behaviour.  Hertzberg,  Maus-  
ner and Syndermann  (1959) put forward  the view that the factors  pro­
ducing  dissatisfaction  in the job were concerned  with non fulfilment  of 
extrinsic  factors  (e.g. pay and working  conditions)  and satisfaction  only 
arose when intrinsic  factors  were present  (e.g. achievement  and recogni ­
tion). Basically  the dissatisfiers  correspond  with Maslow ’s lower needs, 
the satisfiers  with Maslow ’s higher  needs.
The strength  of an individuals  preference  for any factor in his work  
is possibly  dependent  on the extent  to which he believes  it will help him 
to obtain  other  outcomes  which  he feels are desirable.  It also shows  that 
people  may seek one goal in order  to fulfill other  needs  and goals outside  
their work.
IV. Work  behaviour
The objective  of effective  man management  is to promote  favourable  
work behaviour.  One can assume  that the behaviour  of all workers  is 
directed  by a fairly rigid set of drives,  modified  by such factors  as early  
upbringing,  personality,  age, experience,  family commitments,  family 
pressures,  the drive to develop  an individual  role, and the role forced  
on a person  by group  membership  and management  actions.  In all these  
processes  there may be a conflict  between  group  and management  expec ­
tations  and the individual ’s personality  resources  and assets.
Theories  of work behaviour  (or motivation  theories)  need to consider  
both the objectives  sought  and the behaviour  used to reach the objectives. 
If one accepts  the basic concepts  of utility  theory  then theories  such as 
those of Vroom  (1964)  and Lawler  (1973)  help explain  behaviour.  These  
effectively  state that man chooses  that behaviour  from a number  of plans  
of behaviour,  which he expects  will provide  the best outcome  as he sees 
it in terms of meeting  the needs he had. This enables  one to consider  
that —
A) Individuals  place different  values  on various  outcomes.
B) People  have expectations  about the possibility  that a certain  effort  
will lead to a certain  behaviour.
C) People  have expectations  about the possibility  that this behaviour  
will lead to certain  outcomes.
If one considers  the determinant  of the effort a person  puts into a 
job, it is the perceived  value to the person  individually  of the likely out­
come of that effort. Thus each individual  has a distinct  set of values  
which  he places  on any likely outcome.  These  values  will be determined  
by many factors  Including  his own personality,  upbringing,  family  and 
group  pressures  and the needs he has to fulfill. Effort in order to maxi ­
mise performance  will only occur if the perceived  value of the outcome  
had the highest  value  to the person.
Expectancy  theory  states that both extrinsic  and intrinsic  factors  can 
satisfy,  and also motivate,  but some people  may be more strongly  moti ­
vated by extrinsic  factors  and some by intrinsic  factors. Secondly,  satis­
faction  is not to be equated  with motivation  but rather  that satisfaction  
will be associated  with motivation  only to the extent  that it is the result
79
of valued  rewards  that are believed  by the employee  to be contingent  upon  
the performance  to be motivated.  A person  might be satisfied  with his 
pay for example,  but pay would motivate  him to perform  well only if 
good performance  was expected  to result in increased  pay. Actions  will 
be associated  with varying  degrees  of profitability  of outcomes.  These  
outcomes  will have value for an individual  when they satisfy  needs he 
has, and the value will vary with the need strength.  In any situation  a 
person  will act so as to maximise  the expected  value of outcomes.
V. Rewards
Man has needs and society  and management  should  provide  rewards  
which  meet these needs,  i.e. if one is hungry  then food is a good reward.
The outcome  of rewards  offered  by management  are complicated  by 
the fact that it is the perceived  value of that reward  which is important  
(see Fig. 1).

There is always  a danger  of management  using its perception  of the 
value of the rewards  which  are not necessarily  the same as that perceived  
by the worker. When one considers  the link between  rewards  and the 
effort one can classify  rewards  as follows :
A) Rewards  not valued (e.g. for the individual  worker  this may be 
affiliation).
B) Rewards  valued  but not dependant  on effort (e.g. time off).
C) Rewards  valued  and dependant  on effort (e.g. recognition).
The value  of rewards  and the rewards  sought  change  over time. Gener ­
ally the greater  the value of a set of rewards  and the higher  the probabil-  
ity that receiving  each of these rewards  depends  upon effort the greater  
effort will be put into any situation.
VI. The interface  between  man and cows
The first sections  of this paper  have outlined  some of the components  
u ^'^^y in which  the worker  (or farmer)  behaves.  When  one considers  
the dairy section  there is another  important  aspect,  i.e. the relationship  
between  man and cows. Analysis  of observations  made  on cow and cow­
men behaviour  show  that personality  traits  of cowmen  are correlated  with 
herd yield and that all factors  being  equal the confident  introvert  person-  
ality type (behaviour)  tended  to develop  a better relationship  with cows  
and that this good relationship  between  man and cows significantly  in­
creased  the milk yield of cows.
A nalysis
Some  forty commercial  Friesian  herds  operating  as one man units  have 
personality  of the cowman  analysed.  The herds  with 
50 - 80 cows, autumn  calving  and feeding  1,400 - 1 600 kgs per cow/year
u feed,  were isolated  and for the twenty  herds in the category
the following  emerges.

The general  symptoms  of a good relationship  
between  man and cow
a) Cows  come more easily  to the collecting  yard.
b) Cows  come more easily  into the parlour.
c) Cows  are less restless  and dung less in the parlour.
d) The cowman  pats and touches  the cows.
e) The cows do not move  away when approached  by the cowman.
f) The cows come  to the cowman  when  out in the field (short  flight  
distance).
B. The behaviour  to adopt
It is now possible  to draw up a generalised  check  list of the desirable  
factors  to look for when selecting  a new cowman.
However,  these are difficult  traits to assess and there are really very 
many other factors  to consider  and which may have important  results. 
Also many farmers  do the milking  themselves  or have a herdsman  who 
seems  to be very satisfactory  even if he does not totally  match  up to the 
generalised  specification.  The more satisfactiry  solution  is to modify  the 
farmer  and cowman ’s behaviour  so that he achieves  a better  relationship  
with his cows. This can be done by ensuring  that certain  activities  which 
cows dislike  are avoided  and certain  activities  which they like are de­
veloped.  This should  have a beneficial  effect on milk yield.
Cows can be made to like their cowman  by receiving  favourable  
stimuli  when they are with him. If they associate  the cowman  and the 
parlour  with pleasant  sensations  they will come in willingly,  want to be 
with the cowman  and be under  less stress whilst  there.
The following  is a part of the behaviour  modification  programme :
When  rounding  up the cows  for milking :
DO’S
—Walk  up to the cow quietly,
—Call to let them know your are 
rounding  them up,
—Walk  confidently  up to the cows  
and stroke  them.DO NOT ’s
—Hit cows with sticks or other  
objects,  make  them run,
—Crowd  them through  gateways, 
shout  unduly  at them.
Herding  cows  into milking  parlour :
—Allow  cows to enter parlour  un­
hurriedly  and in their  own order  
(if they hang back — find out 
why).
—Approach  those cows hanging  
back with gentle  talk and walk 
them into the parlour  with a 
confident  manner.-Confuse  or upset  cows by trying 
to rush.
82
Preparing  cows for milking :
-Let cow know where you are 
by talking  to her then stroking  
her with your hand moving 
towards  the udder,
-ALWAYS  stick to the routine  
the cow is used to.
Make special  effort to reassure  
nervous  cow or heifer,
-Ensure  your behaviour  is con­
sistent,  a given reaction  of cow 
should  always  elicit the consis-  
tant reaction  by you.Make  sudden,  unexpected  
movements,  handle udder un­
expectedly,  or roughly.
Leaving  the parlou]'  after mUking  :
—Hurry  cows out of parlour.  
Make  cows reluctant  to come  in 
next time,  due to fear of cow­
man.—Let the cows walk out at their  
own speed and in their own 
order.
—Encourage  first cow to move by 
a gentle  pat if necessary.
Calving :
The cow is particularly  sensitive  to new stimuli  at this time. Make  
sure your actions  to her are favourable  and pleasant,  as she will remem ­
ber if they are not !
DO NOT ’s 
—Be impatient,  
—Flap.DO’S
—Talk to cow in gentle  tone,
—Make steady quiet movements  
round  cow,
—Be confident  and in control,
—This is an opportunity  to create  
a relationship  of trust between  
man and cow—make a fuss of 
her, rub her udder,  scratch  her 
face, rump,  etc.
First few milkings :
During  this time the cow is under  stress and sensitive  to new stimuli,  
the routine  is changing  and she misses  her calf. You must be a substitute  
for the calf. You must encourage  her to eat as much as possible  and to 
let her milk down  freely.
—Get the cow to think that milk ­
ing is a pleasant  experience,
—Make sure you touch the cow 
gently  and speak  kindly  to her,
—Handle  udder  carefully,
—Talk to her.—Cause  cow pain or stress,
—Make  cow frightened,  or 
“dread ” milking,
—If cow knocks unit off, calm  
her down before trying to put 
unit on again.
83
In conclusion  it can be said that sensation  of pleasure  are reinforced  
by reward  feeding,  patting,  and tone of voice on approaching  cow. Un­
pleasant  feelings  are minimised  by elimination  of unfavourable  treatment,  
especially  in the parlour  and at calving.
A sound  relationship  is based  on communication  and confidence.  Thus  
the competent  cowman  on top of his job talks to his cows when they are 
under  stress,  as during  milking.  He uses a pleasant  voice but at times he 
displays  the necessary  dominance,  since cows can sense worry  in the cow­
man when he is dealing  with them.

A. Check  the formal  structure  of the farm, i.e. 
and appraisal.
Check  chain  of commands,  communication  processes,  etc. This over­
comes  the problem  of instruction  being  given by more than one per­
son.
Consider  the problems  of the interface  between  animal  and man on 
the dairy farm.
Look at the jobs on the farm and modify  if necessary  using the fol­
lowing criteria which includes  positive  consideration  of human  
characteristics  and needs.
a) optimum  variety  of tasks and skills;
b) some control  over methods,  pace and sequence;
c) a meaningful  and compatible  pattern  of tasks making  a recognis ­
able contribution;
d) optimum  length  of work cycle;
e) feedback  on performance,  as far as possible  through  the work 
itself;
f) opportunity  for learning  and development;
g) opportunity  for contact  and collaboration  with others.
D. Consider  and rate each job on the following  criteria ;
Skill variety  “
Task identity — 
Task significance  — 
Autonomy  —
Feedback
KnowledgeThe degree  to which  skill variety  is necessary 
in a job.
How far the job is a complete  entity.
The impact  of the job on the lives of others. 
The degree to which the job provides  the 
worker  with independence,  freedom,  and de­
cision  making.
How much  effective  feedback  occurs.
Degree  to which knowledge  is acquired  re­
lated and used.
Atternpt  to put yourself  in the place of the person  being managed,  
examine  the following  points :
Communications :
i worker  must have knowledge  of aims of the business;
ii worker  must have information  to do job well;
iii worker  must pass on information  to supervisors;
iv worker  must feel action  is taken  on information  given.
84
b) Personal  Relationship :
i teamwork;
ii close  relationship  with supervisors;
iii help and co-operation  with colleagues;
iv worker must feel he can influence  his workplace  activities,  
methods  and standards.
c) Control :
i worker  must feel he can control  his work and methods;
ii workers  must have influence  over others whose  job affects his 
work;
iii group  consultation  on job methods;
iv checking  of work standards.
d) Leadership ;
i worker  must have confidence  in top management/immediate  
superior;
ii management  must try to understand  work problems;
iii management  must value and invite opinions  on all aspects  of 
the work;
iv workers  efforts  must be appreciated;
V a consistent  action  and reaction  is important.
e) Decision  making :
i decisions  should be made on all levels — worker  must have  
opportunity  to take decisions;
ii management  must be aware of work problems  when it makes  
decisions;
iii workers ’ ideas must influence  decisions  made.
f) Work  targets ;
i workers  must be involved  in setting  targets;
ii targets  must be clearly  defined;
iii targets  must be acceptable;
iv a sense of achievement  must be got from the job.
g) Performance  standards :
i ensure  job cannot  be improved  by using new methods;,
ii avoid  waste;
iii ensure  correct  training  given;
iv ensure  jobs as whole  well organised  (e.g. all daily jobs not just 
milking).
But at all times consider  the worker  as an individual  with individual  
needs  and aspirations.
F. Consider  needs  of worker ’s wife and family.
G. The fundamental  long term problem  is that agricultural  workers  are 
finding  it increasingly  difficult  to identify  with the goals and objec ­
tives of the organisations  which employ  them. Until the worker  is 
able to modify  the goals and objectives  of the organisation  he will 
have no incentive  to put his best into the job.

Introduction
Mr. Chairman,  I wish to express  my thanks  to the trustees  for inviting  me 
to give this Seventh  Edward  Richards  - Orpen Memorial  lecture.
A National  Brucellosis  Eradication  scheme  was begun in Ireland  in 
1966. The position  in 1977 is that six counties  have been declared  free 
and eight counties  are undergoing  compulsory  blood  testing  in the clear ­
ance area. The remaining  12 counties  can avail of the Voluntary  Brucel ­
losis Pre-Intensive  scheme  which was designed  to prepare  the way for 
compulsory  measures.  Northern  Ireland  also has a Brucellosis  Eradica ­
tion programme  which was commenced  in 1964 and is nearing  comple ­
tion.
Ireland  is an island and there are strict controls  on the import  of 
livestock.  Therefore  the problem  is one from within  the country. The 
northern  half of the island  is almost  free of Brucellosis,  but has a popula ­
tion of susceptible  animals  while the southern  half has a high prevalence  
of the disease. In order to improve  this situation  immediate  steps must  
be taken  to reduce  the disease  prevalence  in the southern  counties  thereby  
removing  the source  of further  infections  in the cleared  areas.
The pressure  of eradication  must be maintained  and even accelerated  
to achieve  a successful  conclusion*'*.  All herdowners  must be informed  
about  the reasons  for following  the eradication  programme*^*.  Most of all 
we must strive for an understanding  of the disease.
History  of the disease
Brucellosis  is a disease  of animals  and man. It is caused  by highly  con­
tagious  Brucella  organisms.  Formerly,  the disease  in the bovine was 
called ‘contagious  abortion ’. This name accurately  described  the prin­
ciple symptoms  and acted as an immediate  warning  of the nature  of the 
disease.  As far back as 1807 “The Complete  Farmer ”, a journal  of the 
time, described  the contagious  nature  of the abortion  and the isolation  
procedures  which should  be undertaken.  However,  the cause of the dis­
ease was not identified  until 1887 when a British  doctor,  named  Bruce,  
and his wife isolated  an organism  from goats milk which  was being  sup­
89
plied to the British  forces  stationed  on the island  of Malta. Large num ­
bers of the troops  contracted  “Malta Fever ”, later to become  known  as 
Brucellosis.  Bruce stopped  the supply  of goat ’s milk and the incidence 
of new infections  dropped  dramatically.
In 1897 Bang and Stribolt  isolated  an organism  from aborting  cows  
which was able to reproduce  the disease  in healthy  stock. The causal  
organism  of “contagious  abortion ” was identified.  It was not until 1918 
that an American  bacteriologist  Alice  Evans  suggested  that the organisms  
described  by Bruce and Bang were very similar. This was subsequently  
proven  to be the case and the group  of organisms  was called Brucella  in 
honour  of Bruce  who first identified  them'^'.
Several  types are now recognised  the first being Brucella  melitensis  
which  caused  “Malta  Fever ” in man. Brucella  abortus  causes  contageous  
abortion  in cattle.  Brucella  ovis in sheep.  Brucella  suis in pigs and Bru­
cella canis is found in dogs. In Ireland  today only Brucella  abortus  is 
identified,  causing  abortion  in cattle and providing  the sole source of 
human  infection.
The disease
Brucellosis  in the bovine  exhibits  one principle  symptom,  i.e. abortion.  
The first abortion  can occur  once cows  reach  exactly  five months  pregnant.  
A majority  of the abortions  are seen around  the seventh  month. A cow 
will usually  abort  only once and then become  a “carrier ”. Some cows  may 
abort  a second  and occasionally  even a third time.
In the bovine,  infection  is usually  picked  up through  the mouth.  Occa ­
sionally  infection  may occur  through  cuts on the skin or by splashes  into 
the eye. This can be called  “direct  infection ”. If a positive  animal  calves  
or aborts unnoticed  and unrestricted,  pasture,  feed and drink may be 
contaminated  by the infected  discharges  of that animal. Cattle subse ­
quently  feeding  or drinking  the contaminated  material  could becorne  in­
fected. This can be called  “indirect  infection ”. A third pathway  of infec ­
tion is through  “latency ” where  a calf is infected  at birth or soon after and 
carries  the infection  through  to adult life.
Brucella  abortus  organisms  thrive and multiply  in the pregnant  ani­
mal. They only survive  for limited  periods  on pasture,  in sheds,  etc. The 
pregnant  infected  animal  therefore  can be regarded  as virtually  the source 
of infection.  All the discharges,  foetus  and placenta  passed  at an infected  
calving  or abortion  contain  millions  of brucella  organisms.  Over 90% 
of the total infection  is passed  at the actual  calving  or abortion.  There ­
fore such animals  must be placed under restriction  to prevent  further  
spread  of the disease.
Brucella  organisms  are easily killed by heat, drying  and the common  
disinfectants.  They survive  longer in the cold and could overwinter  if 
frozen. This is unlikely  to happen  under  Irish conditions.  The organisms  
will usually  die out within  two months  in sheds or growing  pasture  and 
within  three months  on land in winter.
The source  of the disease  and the time of spread  is known.  Therefore  
it should be possible  to initiate  management  procedures  to bring about  
its control.
90
Control  of Brucellosis
The key to controlling  the disease  is to “break the cycle ” of infection  
which  occurs  from year to year. The basic aim it to restrict  the positive  
cow and her infected  discharges  at calving  or abortion  and secondly  to 
maximise  within-herd  resistance  to the disease.  This can be achieved  by 
using simple  management  procedures  based on the following  principles.
The management  procedures  come under  five principle  headings :
(1) Identification
(2) Separation
(3) Calving  facilities
(4) Vaccination
(5) Disinfection
(1) Identification
There  are two main tests for identification  of brucellosis  positive  cows  
in Ireland.  The first, which is used in the Eradication  area, is the Blood  
Test. All blood  samples  are tested  at the National  Brucellosis  Laboratory,  
Dept, of Agriculture,  ‘Thorndale ’, Dublin  9. The positive  cows are ear- 
punched  and sent for immediate  slaughter  while the remainder  of the 
herd is put under movement  restriction  or ‘locked  up’ and re-tested  until 
clear.
The second  test which  is used in the Pre-Intensive  scheme  area is the 
Milk Ring Test. This is carried  out on bulk (churn)  milk samples  at the 
creamery  and on the individual  cows in positive  herds.  Under  this scheme, 
where cows are likely to be kept for a period,  positive  cows should  be 
marked  with an easily identifiable  coloured  ear tag. neck band or code 
number.  This will Indicate  the brucellosis  status  of the cows to anybody  
herding  the animals.
(2) Separation
The principle  method  of spread  of brucellosis  is by direct  contact  be­
tween negative  animals  and the infected  products  passed  at an infected 
calving  or abortion.  It is recommended  therefore  that once the positive 
cows are identified  plans should  be made to separate  the positive  and 
negative  cows. Ideally,  this should  be done as soon as pregnant  ariirnals  
reach  four and a half months  gestation.  This will eliminate  the possibility  
of direct  contact  between  positive  and negative  animals  should  an abor ­
tion occur unnoticed.  If separation  is not possible  at this time then the 
cows must be carefully  herded. A separation  may be possible  once the 
cows go dry. Positive  and negative  cows should  never be run together  at 
the same silage face.
In the spring  calving  herds a farmer  chooses  a date on which  to com­
mence  serving  his cows. He can then put a reminder  on his calendar  of 
the separation  date, four and a half months  later. In a herd where  cows  
have been calving  all the year round a farmer  can choose  two dates for 
commencement  of service,  one for his ‘spring ’ herd and one for his 
‘autumn ’ herd. He will then be in a position  to know the dates on which 
his cows will reach four and a half months  pregnant.
91
Under  the Eradication  Scheme  positive  cows should  be totally  isolated 
because  the remainder  of the herd are highly  susceptible  (non-vaccinated)  
cows. Under  the Pre-Intensive  scheme,  vaccination  with the killed  45/20  
adjuvant  vaccine  (K45/20A)  is widely practised,  earnestly  encouraged  
and is mandatory  for replacement  heifers. With these animals  separation  
can be effective  with as little as an electric  fence. However,  the best 
separation  possible  should  be used on each farm. Positive  cows could be 
grazed  on separate  land or on the paddock  behind  the grazing  rotation.  
Separate  wintering  arrangements  must be made to avoid putting  positive 
and negative  cows together  at the silage  face.
Herding.  The times  at which  Brucella  abortions  may occur  have been 
pointed  out. There  are definite  signs to be seen pre-abortion.  The prin­
ciple signs are : (1) sudden  springing  of the udder,  (2) slime at the vulva 
or on the hind quarters,  (3) dropped  pin bones (raised  tailhead),  (4) un­
usual uneasiness.  Pregnant  animals  showing  any of these signs should  be 
isolated  until they either abort or settle down. The important  point in 
herding  pregnant  animals  is to inspect  the hind quarters.  This should  be 
done twice a day.
(3) Calving  facility
The first requirement  in a brucellosis  positive  herd is that a separate  
calving  facility  be provided  for positive  and negative  animals. These  
facilities  should be sited carefully  away from the main farm road and 
with safe drainage,  preferably  into a separate  soak pit. It is also essential  
that there should  be no contact  between  positive  and negative  units either  
directly  or via the drainage.
A calving  facility  can be any of the following :
(a) Individual  calving  box
(b) Tie up shed
(c) Calving  shed
(d) Loose  house
(e) Small  field or paddock
(a) The individual  calving  box is ideal. All of the discharges  passed  
at the calving  or abortion  will be restricted  and the box can be easily 
cleaned  and disinfected.  Even where individual  boxes are available  a 
certain  number  should  be allotted  to the positive  cows and only positive 
cows should  be calved  in them. These would be the boxes next to the 
drainage  outlet.
Many buildings  have become  redundant  due to changes  in manage ­
ment, i.e. self feed layout. These buildings  could be converted  into calv­
ing boxes  to reduce  the overall  cost, provided  they are suitably  sited and 
drained.
(b) The tie up shed or cow byre is a very good system  for confining 
the pregnant  and calving  cow. The positive  cows should  be tied together,  
next to the drainage  outlet and by expected  calving  date. The negative  
cows can be tied in the shed with an empty standing  between  the two 
groups. The negative  cows should also be tied according  to expected  
calving  date. This will avoid the possibility  of cows in mid or early preg­
nancy  becoming  infected  and having  an abortion.
92
(c) A calving  shed which is divided  by gates into boxes  can be used 
for one or other group. Sheeting  the gates with galvanised  iron or hard-  
board  would  be a useful  addition.
(d) A small field or paddock  could be used for either  group. This 
paddock  should  not be grazed  for three months  following  the last calving.
Any of the above  facilities  or any combination  of them may be used 
successfully.
Note : The best facility  should  always  be used for the negative  cows  
in case one is incubating  the disease  and has not been identified  as in­
fected. This will help to minimise  or eliminate  further  spread  of infection.
(4) Vaccination
In the case of brucellosis  only a dead vaccine  has been used in Ireland  
since 1968. This is called  the killed strain  45/20  adjuvant  vaccine  (K45/  
20A). The aim of any vaccination  programme  is to prevent  infection  tak­
ing place. Therefore  the vaccine  should be given before animals  are 
exposed  to infection.  Vaccination  of heifers  against  brucellosis  should  
be carried  out when they reach 12 months  of age. A primary  (essential) 
course of vaccination  comprises  two inoculations  given 6 to 12 weeks 
apart. This should  be completed  before  the heifers  are served.  In infected 
herds,  with abortions  occurring  each year, booster  vaccination  should  be 
given annually.  In herds without  infection  booster  vaccination  can be 
given every 18 months  or two years. This vaccination  should  be given 
when cows are non-pregnant  so as to try and prevent  infection  taking  
place.
It is now widely  accepted  that some of the cells in the immune  system 
of the animal  which  are sensitised  by vaccination  can live for 10 years or 
more. Therefore  the protective  effect of brucellosis  vaccination  can be 
expected  to reduce,  slowly,  over a number  of years.
(5) Disinfection
Brucella  organisms  are quite easily killed by disinfection.  Disinfec ­
tants should  be made  up according  to the manufacturer ’s specification  and 
renewed  regularly.  The Department  of Agriculture  publishes  a list of 
approved  disinfectants  for various  diseases,  including  brucellosis,  and 
gives the dilution  rates at which  they should  be used.
A foot dip (basin,  bucket,  small trough,  etc.) should  be placed  outside  
each calving  facility.  Boots  should  be dipped  going  in and coming  out of 
each area. All the bedding  from the calving  facilities  should  be sprayed  
with disinfectant  (sprayer,  sprinkling  can, etc.) before  removal  and stacked  
separately.  Calving  boxes, especially  those used for the negative  cows,  
should  be cleaned  out and disinfected  between  calvings.
When  an abortion  or calving  occurs  amongst  a group  of animals,  the 
cows should  be removed  immediately  and the area thoroughly  disinfected.  
If this occurs  while grazing,  the herd should  be moved  on to the next 
paddock.
Note : Once steps have been taken to control  the disease  within  the 
herd extra attention  should  be paid to the farm fencing  to ensure  that it 
remains  stockproof.
93
Brucellosis  control  programme  at Moorepark
A brucellosis  control  programme,  based  on the principles  already  dis­
cussed,  was introduced  to the six dairy herds  of the Moorepark  centre  and 
field stations  in the autumn  of 1974. All six farms  were accepted  into the 
Pre-Intensive  Scheme. The overall brucellosis  prevalence  was 20.9%,  
varying  between  herds from 12.8% to 28.9%  positive. Herd size ranged  
from 130 to 250 cows. The total number  of cows tested in 1974 was 990.
(1) Identification
Routine  blood and milk samples  were collected  simultaneously  from 
each individual  cow once the whole herd had calved  down. The milk 
ring test was repeated  six weeks later while all the cows were still in 
lactation.  The blood test was repeated  when the cows were in mid preg­
nancy. All the positive  cows were marked  with a white tag in the left 
ear.
(2) Separation
Due to other on-going  experiments  it was not possible  to separate  
cows from the middle  of the fourth month of gestation. However,  a 
reminder  was put on the calendar  to commence  careful  herding  of the 
cows from this time onwards.  In general  the positive  cows were separated  
once they went dry or as they came  off experiment.  In Herd E and a small 
group in Herd A, there was no separation  of the positive  cows. They 
remained  in their experimental  groups  for grazing  and on silage,  but were 
removed  for calving.
The positive  cows returned  to the milking  herd seven  days after they 
passed  the afterbirth,  provided  there was no obvious  discharge  from the 
vagina. Until this time the positive  cows were milked  last.
(3) Calving  facilities
The calving  facilities  were arranged  to keep the best facilities  on each 
farm for the negative  cows.
In Herd A, two four-pen  calving  sheds  were used for calving  the nega ­
tive cows. The positive  cows were tied in individual  feeding  stalls and 
calved  in a pen at the end of the row. The late calving  positive  cows were 
calved  in the lower  of the two calving  sheds.
In Herd B the negative  cows were calved  in a loose house  divided  into 
two pens while the positives  were calved  in two small paddocks.
In Herd C the negative  cows were calved in six individual  calving 
sheds  while  the positive  cows were calved  in an old cow byre.
In Herd D the negative  cows were calved  in a large shed divided  into 
six boxes,  two at each side opening  into two in the centre. The positive 
cows were calved  in a small  paddock  where  an L-shaped  galvanised  wind ­
break  was provided.
In Herd E the negative  cows were calved  in a four pen calving  shed 
while the positives  were calved  in a loose house.
In Herd F in 1974 the autumn  calving  cows calved  in a paddock  mixed 
together  before  the management  programme  began. Subsequently  positive 
and negative  cows were calved  in individual  boxes.

(4) Vaccination
All cows  were booster  vaccinated  annually  in the spring  until the posi­
tive cows had been removed  from the herd. Biennially  vaccination  will 
be continued  in these herds. The replacement  heifers  were vaccinated  as 
yearlings  before  being  served. They  were blood  tested  subsequently  when  
2 - 3 months  pregnant.  The ‘latent  carrier ’ would  appear  to give a positive  
result  at this stage. Such heifers  were then placed  under  restriction.
(5) Disinfection
The disinfectant  used in 1974 was “Chloros ” while “Jeyes Fluid ” has 
been used since then in all the herds. Any of the other approved  disin ­
fectants  could  also be used. Garden  sprayers  were used in 1974, 1975 for 
spraying  disinfectant  onto bedding,  cow ’s hind quarters,  etc., but were 
somewhat  fragile  and tended  to corrode.  Sprinkling  cans are now used.
The results  from the six individual  farms  are given in Table 1. Certain  
changes  in farm size and animal  numbers  occurred  which  are explained  
in the following  way. Herd A received  the majority  of both spring  and 
autumn  calving  cows from Herd F in winter  1974 and spring 1975. Some  
positive  cows were also brought  in to facilitate  the clearance  of brucellosis  
from other herds, i.e. Herd C, Herd D, Herd E and Herd F. All move ­
ments of animals  was carried  out under permit  from the Department  of 
Agriculture.
Herd C was reduced  in size due to reduction  in farm acreage.  Herd D 
was transferred  to a new farm in Spring 1977 following  the sale of all 
known  positive  cows. Herd E was reduced  in size due to reseeding  of 
half the farm. Herd F was made up of 92 heifers  which calved  as two- 
year-olds  in 1976 and the number  was increased  to 138 following  the in­
troduction  of 50 three-year-old  heifers  in 1977.
The important  features  to note in the results  are the very small number  
of new positive  cows which were identified  each year indicating  that the 
spread of the disease had been brought  under control  in each herd. 
Gradual  elimination  of positive  cows from the various  herds have left 
four herds free in summer  1977. The three positive  cows in Herd D were 
sold off. Extra replacements  have been reared and it is hoped to milk 
out the positive  cows in the remaining  two herds in 1978 and not put 
them back in calf. The new positive  cows in 1976 and 1977 are almost  
entirely  second  calvers.
The other  feature  of the results  is the high number  of positive  replace ­
ment heifers  which  were introduced  up to 1976. This problem  has been 
overcome  by the blood test which is carried  out on the heifers  at 2 - 3 
months  pregnant  as previously  described.  The three new heifers  in Herd  
D in 1977 had been exposed  subsequent  to testing.
The difficulties  experienced  at the beginning  of the control  procedures  
were: (1) the abortion  at the end of five months  gestation,  (2) the occa ­
sional very quick premature  calving  between  8 - 9 months  gestation  and 
(3) heifers  drinking  from contaminated  water supplies  (river  and stream).  
These  problems  were dealt with by putting  a reminder  for herding  on the 
calendar,  careful  and regular  observation  of heavily  pregnant  cows and 
by providing  piped  drinking  water  for the paddocks  concerned.

The overall  culling  rate was approximately  20% and was non selec­
tive for brucellosis  positive  cows.
Milk Ring Test
In order to monitor  the Milk Ring Test (MRT)  results,  simultaneous  
blood samples  were collected  from all cows. A comparison  of the Milk  
Ring Test results  with the Blood  Serum  Agglutination  test (SAT)  results 
are shown  in Tables  2 and 3. Of the 146 cows which  were positive  to the 
MRT as interpreted  under the Brucellosis  Pre-Intensive  Scheme,  96% 
had a simultaneous  SAT positive  result  (Table  2). Much  of the difference  
between  these two figures  is bridged  by looking  at the results  in Table  
4 which show that any cow giving  a reading  of 2+ (50% agglutination)  
or greater  on the neat milk has more than an 88% chance  of being  SAT 
positive.
96
These  results  show that the MRT  as interpreted  under  the Brucellosis  
Pre-Intensive  Scheme  is identifying  positive  animals  with very few excep ­
tions, i.e. where  there is a false positive  result. They also show a propor ­
tion of suspect  reactions  which  indicate  that these cows should,  at least,  
be resampled  while still in mid lactation.  The disease  is dynamic  not 
static. New cows may have become  infected  and it can take some time 
for these animals  to give a positive  result. Again,  there is the need for 
resampling.  As approximately  90% of cows become  infected  in the 
udder<5. ’) it would  appear  appropriate  that a blood test be carried  out, 
following  disposal  of the MRT  positive  cows, to finalise  accreditation  of 
the herd.
All tests were carried  out using  antigens  to E.E.C./W.H.O.  standards^*)

The ‘latent carrier ’ heifers  appeared  to be identified  by a blood test, 
as described  earlier,  carried  out after vaccination  and service  but before 
they reached  five months  gestation,  i.e. at 2 - 3 months  pregnant.  The 
figures  for 1976 - 11 (Table  5) show that the four positive  heifers  represent  
approximately  1% and come from positive  herds rather than just from 
positive  dams. Once these heifers  are identified  they must be removed 
and placed  under  restriction.  The remaining  heifers  should  still be herded  
carefully  in case of subsequent  exposure.  It is the early unnoticed  abor ­
tion amongst  a group  of heifers  which can lead to a high number  of in­
fected  replacement  animals.

Discussion
The results  obtained  over three years in Moorepark  using basic man­
agement  techniques  in the control  of Brucellosis  suggest  that such pro­
cedures  will give a satisfactory  outcome  for the extra amount  of thought  
and effort required  to operate  them. Control  is not 100 per cent but it so 
radically  slows down the spread of the disease  that by selling off the 
known  positive  animals  the source  of spread  within  the herd is eliminated.  
Thus your problem  is reduced  to a minimum  at which  stage eradication  
is very possible.
The approach  to be adopted  is very straightforward.  The extent  of the 
problem  must be discovered  by testing the herd and the within herd 
resistance  must be maximised  by vaccination.  Then,  the farmer  can de­
cide, with the help of his Veterinary  and Agricultural  advisers,  how he 
can handle  the separation  and calving  of positive  and negative  cows on 
his farm. All a herdowner  can do is to use the facilities  which  are already  
available  on the farm. He should  plan and organise  for any necessary 
improvements  and herd the pregnant  animals  carefully  at the appropriate  
times.
A knowledge  of the disease  pattern,  which  is very consistent,  gives the 
farmer  the opportunity  to intervene  at the appropriate  time and ‘break  the 
cycle ’ of the infection,  thereby  bringing  Brucellosis  under  control.  Once 
he can control  the disease  he can plan a culling  and replacement  pro­
gramme  to eliminate  the disease  as quickly  as is economically  possible. 
Three  years should  be the maximum  timescale  for any herd.
The Pre-Intensive  Brucellosis  Scheme  has been in operation  since 1973 
based  on the Milk Ring Testing  (MRT)  of bulk milk at the creamery  and
98
the individual  cows in positive  herds. The aim of this Pre-Intensive  or 
Pre-Eradication  Scheme  is to reduce  the pool of infection  in advance  of 
the compulsory  blood test and slaughter  policy. It has not suceeded  in 
its aim despite  the supportive  intervention  of the major Co-Operatives.  
Therefore  we find ourselves  in the position  that most of the 12 counties  
in the non-eradication  area still have too high a prevalence  of the disease.
One half of the country  has very little brucellosis  and the other half 
has a high prevalence.  It is unrealistic  to expect  that further  progress  can 
be made in the Eradication  areas while the remainder  of the country  has 
such high infection  levels. We must concentrate  and accelerate  our efforts  
in the southern  counties  in order to reduce  the source  of spread  of the 
disease.  What I would  suggest,  keeping  in mind the ability  to control  the 
disease  and the time necessary  for the economic  removal  and replacement  
of positive  animals,  is a three year Compulsory  Pre-Intensive  Scheme,  to 
be followed  immediately  by compulsory  blood test and slaughter.
During  the three year period  dairy herds would  continue  to be MRT  
tested  along  the lines I have suggested  and the beef herds  could be tested  
by an accurate,  rapid and cheap  screening  blood  test. All positive  animals  
would be punched  and their identity  cards collected.  Bonuses,  as now,  
would  be paid on slaughter  of these animals.  A clear blood  test would  be 
the accredtiation  test for all herds.
This would  mean that as many positive  animals  as possible  would  be 
identified  quickly  and their access  to the open market  restricted.  It would 
give time for the rearing  of extra replacements  to maintain  stock  numbers  
and positive  cows could be milked  out and culled  at the end of lactation.  
The use of the brucellosis  vaccine  (K45/20A)  would  continue  and should  
be greatly  encouraged  over this period  to boost  within  herd resistance.
Brucellosis  is dynamic  not static. We must keep the pressure  on to 
reduce  the disease  prevalence.  This point is emphasised  by Hugh-Jones  
in his recent “Evaluation  of Brucellosis  Eradication  in England  and 
Wales” <^>. He also emphasised  the need for the constant  review  of eradi ­
cation  policy. We have a very good series  of tests available  which  can be 
strategically  applied  to the problems  of the individual  herd. All we need 
is the will to do the job and the confidence  that we will be successful.

SWARD  PROCESSES  UNDER  GRAZING  
A. J. BRERETON
The Agricultural  Institute,  Johnstown  Castle,  Wexford.
A grazed  perennial  ryegrass  (S24) sward  was analysed  in detail  during  
13 months  from 1st February  1977 until late Marsh  1978. In the analyses, 
emphasis  is being placed  on the identification  and quantification  of the 
factors  affecting  daily grass growth  rate during  the rest period. The fac­
tors considered  are (a' climate,  (b) physiological  and (c) management.  
The climatically  determined  growth  rates were calculated  using relation ­
ships obtained  from published  work. Both temperature  and radiation  
markedly  depressed  growth rate before May and after September. 
Drought  depressed  growth  rates during  July and August.  The climatic ­
ally determined  rates were compared  with observed  growth  rates. The 
results  show that the calculated  growth  rate overestimates  growth  rate in 
the May-June  period  by a factor  of about  two and underestimates  growth  
rates at the end of the season  (September-October)  by a factor  of about  
two. This discrepancy  between  calculated  and observed  growth  rates is 
attributed  to the effect of flowering  which is averaged  over the season  in 
the calculated  data. The results  indicate  that the growth  rate of a repro ­
ductive  sward is three to four times as great as the growth  rate of a 
vegetative  sward. The difference  in growth  rate between  reproductive  
and vegetative  swards  was largely  due to the difference  in leaf net assim ­
ilation  rate. The difference  in leaf net assimilation  rate was only partly  
accounted  for by differences  in solar radiation  receipt.

GRASS  PRODUCTION  AND EARLY  FAT LAMB  PERFORM ­
ANCE  ON SOD SEEDED  OLD PASTURES  AT BELCLARE
E. GRENNAN
The Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
The climate  in the west of Ireland  is favourable  for the production  of 
early grass but this potential  is difficult  to exploit  where  old permanent  
pastures  predominate.  If early growing  grasses  are established  in old 
pastures  by the “stitching-in ” technique,  they could  considerably  improve  
the potential  for early grass growth.
RVP Italian ryegrass  was successfully  stitched  into old pastures  in 
1974. Pastures  were grazed  bare, sprayed  with gramoxone  at 700 ccs/ 
hectare  and RVP sown with a Bettinson  3D, (17.8 cm spacing)  at 19 
kg seed/ha  in mid-July  or early September.  A sowing  was also made  
after a silage cut in early September,  without  using gramoxone.
Establishment  of Italian  ryegrass  was satisfactory  on each site, though  
somewhat  better  on grazed  and sprayed  sites than after silage. Spraying  
pastures  in early September  reduced  autumn  growth  by about 600 kg 
D.M./ha.
Yields were measured  in 1975 and 1976 in a simulated  three cut 
silage system  on plots receiving  0, 50 or 100 kg N/ha  for each cut. Total  
yields  were highest  on stitched  in plots,  the difference  being  about  900 to 
1,500 kg/ha or 12 to 15 per cent. The benefit  of Italian  ryegrass  was 
most noticeable  in spring  and in pasture  recovery  after cutting,  especially  
during  dry periods.
Old and stitched-in  pastures  were grazed  with an early lambing  ewe 
flock from late February  through  April and stocked  at 7.5, 12.5 or 17.5 
ewes plus lambs per hectare. The extra grass on stitched-in  paddocks  
was reflected  in improved  liveweight  gain in lambs,  at all stocking  rates  
in 1975 and at the low and high stocking  rates in 1976.
The response  to stitching-in  Italian  ryegrass  looks promising,  but the 
management  of Italian  in an old pasture  in relation  to dates  of silage  cuts 
needs attention.

THE DIGESTIBLE  AND METABOLISABLE  ENERGY  OF 
GRASS  JUICE  FOR GROWING  PIGS
O. CARTON  and M. F. MAGUIRE  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
The mechanical  pulping  and squeezing  of high moisture  forage  crops  
produces  a protein  rich juice and an ensilable  high dry matter crop 
residue.  The juice contains  6-10%  dry matter  of which  30-35%  is crude  
protein  having 6.5% lysine. For grass crops harvested  at four week 
intervals  throughout  the season  the juice extract  contains  approximately  
30% of the total dry matter  production  and 45% of the crude protein.
A digestibility  trial was conducted  to establish  the digestible  energy 
(DE) and metabolisable  energy  (ME)  of grass  juice for growing  pigs. The 
grass juice was prepared  from a late autumn  cut of a tetraploid  ryegrass. 
The juice,  concentrated  to 11% DM (4.2% CP, 2.6% ash) and preserved 
with HCl and Sodium  Metabisulphite,  was used to replace  30% of the 
organic  matter  in a barley-soyabean  ration  fed in the preliminary  period.  
Five pigs of initial  weight  37-39  kg were used in metabolism  crates.
The basal diet had dry matter  digestibility  (DMD)  and organic  matter  
digestibility  (OMD)  values  of 82.1 and 89.5%  respectively.  The digestibil ­
ity of grass juice  dry matter  and organic  matter  (calculated  by difference) 
was 69.9 and 90.9% respectively.  The determined  DE and ME values  
for grass juice on a dry matter  basis were 9.89 MJ/kg  and 8.17 MJ/kg.  
The corresponding  values  on an ash-free  basis were 12.68 MJ/kg  and 
10.51 MJ/kg.

SILAGE  EFFLUENT  AS A SOURCE  OF NUTRIENTS  FOR  
THE GROWING  PIG
D. C. PATTERSON  and N. WALKER
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of Northern  Ireland.  Hillsborough.
Co. Down.
In preliminary  studies  effluent  was readily  consumed  by the pig with­
out toxic effects. In two subsequent  exfieriments  littermate  pairs of pigs 
were individually-fed  either  a meal plus water  control  diet or an effluent 
containing  diet in which silage effluent  formed  150 g/kg of dry matter  
fed. All pigs were fed to a scale based  on metabolic  body weight.
In the first experiment,  freshly  collected  effluent  from two sources  was 
offered  over a liveweight  range  of 64 to 85 kg. The daily gains  were 719, 
715 and 753 ± 16.8 g and feed : gain ratios were 3.07, 3.10 and 2.94 
± 0.075 g for the control  and two effluent  treatments  respectively.  In the 
seeond  experiment  effluent  was stored  for 3.5, 14, 28, 56, 112 or 240 days 
before  being  given  to pigs. Initial  and final liveweights  were 33 and 83 kg 
respectively.  Littermate  pairs of pigs were allocated  to a stored  effluent 
treatment  and a contemporary  control  treatment  as the stored effluents 
were not available  for testing  simultaneously.  The use of contemporary  
control  treatments  permitted  adjustment  of means  for differences  in time. 
The overall  mean daily gains on the effluent  and control  diets were 646 
and 655 ± 7.5 *g respectively.  For the same comparison  the mean  feed : 
gain ratios  (DM basis)  were 2.69 and 2.64 ±0.03 *g and subcutaneous  fat 
contents  of the rump back joint were 271 and 279 ± 5.6 *g/kg  respec ­
tively. None of these differences  were significant.  Pig performance  did 
not deteriorate  with increasing  period  of effluent  storage.
An experiment  is currently  in progress  in which  the performance  of 
pigs given an all-meal  or effluent  containing  diet is being compared  in 
both individual  and group-penning  situations.  Results  to date indicate  
that performance  on the diet containing  silage effluent  is as good as on 
the all-meal  diet in both cases.
The experimental  work to date has shown  that effluent  can replace  
150 g/kg of the dry matter  of the finisher  diet of bacon  pigs resulting  in 
a substantial  saving  in feed costs.

LABORATORY  STUDIES  ON GRASS  SILAGE
R. K. WILSON,  A. V. FLYNN  and D. COLLINS  
The Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
About  25% of farm silages  in this country  are poorly  preserved  with 
pH values of 4.7 or greater^ In an attempt  to explain  this result the 
effects  of nitrogen  fertiliser,  wilting,  grass genera  and ensilage  technique  
on silage fermentation  were examined  in laboratory  silos.
In three experiments,  application  of N seven  weeks  before  cutting  had 
little effect on silage quality.  Wilting  was unreliable.
Grass genus had a very significant  effect. It was jTOssible  to rank 
grasses for silage making  as follows : ryegrass,  good; old permanent  
pasture,  timothy,  tall fescue,  bent grass, red fescue,  moderate;  yorkshire  
fog and cocksfoot,  poor.
Speed of filling had a large effect and slow filling,  accompanied  by 
heating  may account  for much poor silage.
Results  for 800 silages relating  grass, water soluble carbohydrate  
(WSC)  and silage pH are tabulated  and suggest  that a WSC level of 14% 
of DM (3% in juice) is required.
Physical  chemistry  calculations  show that pH in silage is largely  the 
result of interaction  of lactic acid and ammonia.

Between  1970 and 1976 there was little Improvement  in silage  quality.  
While in 1977 dry matter  and crude protein  content  increased  as did 
in vitro  dry matter  digestibility,  preservation  was poor. There  was a trend

FEED FACTORS  AFFECTING  INTAKE  AND BEEF  
PRODUCTION  BY SILAGE  FED CATTLE
V. FLYNN
The Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
While it has for long been recognised  that digestibility  is the major  
factor  determining  intake and animal  production  potential  of dried for­
ages, this relationship  has been less well defined  for silages.  The apparent  
inconsistency  in the relationship  for silages has to some extent been 
attributed  to the nature  of the ensiling  fermentation  and to a depressing  
effect of extensive  fermentation  on silage intake. Consequently  it has 
often been considered  desirable  to increase  the dry matter  content  of 
herbage  by wilting  before ensiling  in order to restrict  the fermentation  
and raise the feeding  value of the silage.
Analyses  of the results  of Grange  feeding  trials in which  40 different  
but well preserved  silages  were fed show a clear relationship  between 
dry matter  digestibility  (DMD)  and production  by 400-500  kg beef cattle.  
DMD values  of 61%, 66%, 69% and 74% have been associated  with 
daily  liveweight  gains of 250 g, 470 g, 670 g and 860 g respectively.  Daily  
carcase  gain has been 560 g on several  of the silages  in the 74% DMD  
class. It must be noted that production  on 74% DMD silage is close to 
that expected  on similar  cattle over an entire grazing  season. This sug­
gests that proper  ensiling  may have little or no effect on the production  
potential  of herbage.
The results  of several  trials comparing  forages  differing  in dry matter  
content  have shown no beef production  advantage  in favour  of higher  
dry matter  forage.
An attempt  was therefore  made to quantify  the effects  of dry matter  
content  and of ensiling  per se on the intake and production  potential  of 
herbage.  During  summer  1977 two groups  of 10 cattle were fed either  
fresh grass or grass wilted for 24 hours. The trial was continued  for 15 
weeks. In the middle  of each week fresh and wilted grass, represen ­
tative of the herbage  fed in that week,  was ensiled. The silages  were fed 
in sequence  after four months  storage  to two groups  of 10 cattle. Similar 
animals  (initial  liveweight  435 kg) were used for grass and silage  parts of 
the experiment.  The mean daily dry matter intakes  of unwilted  and 
wilted grass and silage were 1.98, 1.90, 1.86 and 1.89% of mean live- 
weight. The corresponding  daily carcase  gains were 420 g, 430 g, 430 g 
and 370 g.
These results indicate  that a well preserved  silage can support  the 
same level of beef production  as the grass from which  it is derived  and 
that dry matter  content  per se does not raise the beef production  poten ­
tial of forage.

EFFECTS  OF CARBOHYDRATE  AND  NITROGEN  SUPPLEMEN ­
TATION  ON THE INTAKE  AND UTILIZATION  OF SILAGE  BY
SHEEP

The efficiency  with which nitrogen  (N) in silage is utilized  may be 
restricted  by degradation  of herbage  protein  to non-protein  nitrogen  
(NPN)  during  ensilage.  In addition,  fermentation  of soluble  carbohyd ­
rate during  ensilage  may limit the energy  available  for ruminal  microbial  
protein  synthesis.
The effect upon animal  performance  of feeding  grass silage alone or 
supplemented  with protein  (casein,  17.1g/kg  fresh silage),  NPN (urea,  
4.56g/kg)  or soluble  carbohydrate  (sucrose  20.6g/kg)  was studied  using  
12 store wether  lambs  in a triple 4x4 Latin Square  experiment.  Para ­
meters measured  included  voluntary  intake, rumen fermentation  and 
blood metabolites.  Eight  of the sheep  were kept in metabolism  cages  for 
digestibility  and balance  studies.  Each period  lasted  21 days with excreta  
being collected  over the final 10 days.
The silage used was of good quality  as indicated  by its composition  
and the performance  of animals  when receiving  silage alone. The effects  
of supplementary  casein  and urea were similar;  DM intake  was depressed  
by 12-13%  and the animals  lost weight,  whilst  levels  of rumen  NH. and 
serum urea, intake and urinary  excretion  of N were raised. Supplemen ­
tary sucrose  did not significantly  affect intake or liveweight  gain but 
reduced  rumen  pH and raised blood glucose  levels. Dry matter  digesti ­
bility, blood pH and N retention  were not significantly  affected  by 
treatment.

THE EFFECTS  OF CEREAL  PROCESSING  AND OF ZINC  
SUPPLEMENTATION  ON THE PERFORMANCE  OF LAMBS
J. L. L’ESTRANGE
Department  of Agriculturai  Chemistry,  University  College,  Glasnevin,
Dublin  9.
A factorial  design  experiment  was carried  out with 42 early weaned 
lambs fed barley based concentrate  ration in which the barley  was fed 
either whole or loose, ground  and loose or ground  and pelleted  after  
mixing  with other ingredients.  In addition,  with each main plot treatment  
the effect of a high level of zinc supplementation  (400 ppm) was com­
pared with a low level (34 ppm) in relation  to the protective  effect of 
zinc against  copper  toxicity.
Live-weight  gain was similar  for the three barley treatments  at ap­
proximately  320 g/day,  but the food conversion  ratio was significantly  
better  on the whole  barley  treatment.  This treatment  resulted  in a higher  
ratio of acetic  to propionic  acid in rumen  fluid of the lambs  accompanied  
by a higher  pH. There  was no appreciable  effect of barley  treatment  on 
the melting  point  or fatty acid composition  of subcutaneous  or perineph ­
ric fat of the lambs.
Copper  toxicity  did not occur on any treatments  but the storage  of 
copper  in liver was considerably  reduced  by the high zinc supplementa ­
tion. Copper  storage  in liver was higher on the pelleted  than on the 
unpelleted  diets. The high zinc supplementation  improved  food intake  
and live-weight  gain of the lambs. It did not affect the pH or volatile  
fatty acids in the rumen  fluid or the melting  point and fatty acid com­
position  of the carcass  fat.

REPLACEMENT  OF CONCENTRATES  WITH ROOTS  IN THE  
DIET OF EARLY  WEANED  LAMBS
S. FITZGERALD
The Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuani,  Co. Galway.
In a system  of accelerated  lamb production,  i.e. three lamb crops in 
two years, the lambs are weaned  at 5-6 wks. of age and subsequently  
reared  on a concentrate  diet. To reduce  feed costs,  two experiments  have 
been carried  out to determine  the extent that concentrates  can be re­
placed with pulped  roots in the diet of such lambs. The lambs were  
introduced  to concentrates  as a creep  feed at three weeks  of age, weaned  
onto concentrates  at 5-6 weeks and after a transitional  period of 7-10 
days were allocated  to diets in which concentrates  were replaced  by 
varying  proportions  of roots. The roots were supplemented  with soya 
bean meal to provide  16% crude protein  in the dietary  dry matter  (DM),  
similar  to the concentrate  diet, with minerals  plus vitamins  added. The 
lambs  were slaughtered  at 38 kg liveweight.
In Trial 1, the proportion  of concentrates  fed in the diet from wean ­
ing until slaughter  was 100, 75, 50 and 25% of the total DM intake.  
Intake  of concentrates  in the mixed  diets was either  restricted  or reduced  
gradually,  with roots fed to appetite.  The roots fed consisted  of a high 
DM fodder  beet variety  Monorosa  (19% DM).
In Trial 2, the proportion  of concentrates  fed was 100, 50, 25 or 5% 
of total intake. In this case a low DM root, yellow  globe mangel  (10%  
DM) was used.
Daily  liveweight  gains in Trial 1 were 284, 263, 278 and 262 g/day  on 
the diets containing  100 to 25% concentrates,  respectively.  Replacing  con­
centrates  with a high proportion  of roots (75%)  increased  days on trial 
(90 to 96 days) increased  daily DM intake/lamb  (937 to 990 g) and total 
DM intake  (86 v 98 kg/lamb)  and resulted  in an increase  in feed conver ­
sion ratio from 3.33 to 3.80 kg DM/kg  lamb gain.
In Trial 2, daily liveweight  gains were 272, 273, 265 and 260 g/day  
for diets containing  100 to 5% concentrates  respectively.  As in Trial 1, 
replacing  concentrates  with a high proportion  of roots supplemented  with 
protein  and minerals  (95%)  resulted  in a longer  fattening  period (89 v 
97 days), a higher  daily DM intake (876 v 985 g/lamb/day)  and total 
intake  (78 v 96 kg/lamb)  and an increased  feed conversion  ratio (3.31 v 
3.82 kg DM/kg  Iwt. gain). There were no differences  between  diets in 
carcass  weight,  killing  out % or gut contents  in either  trial.
The results indicate  that pulped roots, supplemented  with protein,  
minerals  and vitamins,  can substantially  replace  concentrates  in the diet 
of early weaned  lambs  at approximately  half of the cost, resulting  in only 
slight reduction  in lamb growth  rates but with an increase  in feed con­
version  rate due to the higher  DM intakes  of roots. Lambs  were able to 
consume  large amounts  of roots  even of a low DM content  at a relatively  
young age. Assuming  that the soya bean meal supplement  used was 
equivalent  to the concentrate  diet in energy  value,  then 1 kg concentrate  
DM was equivalent  to 1.2 kg root DM in terms of feed conversion  
efficiency  to liveweight  gain.

THE RELATIVE  EEFICIENCY  OF FOOD UTILIZATION  BY 
FRIESIAN  BULLS  AND STEERS

A combined  nutritional  balance  and comparative  slaughter  trial using  
20 animals  compared  Friesian  male (E) and castrate  male (C) cattle  when 
pair fed at two planes  of nutrition  (M and H) over the liveweight  (LW) 
range 130-400  kg. Animals  were placed  on nutritional  balance  on four 
occasions  during  the period. Liveweight  gains for each treatment  were 
(kg/day) : EH 1.10, EM 0.91, CH 0.93, CM 0.79. There were no sig­
nificant  differences  between  the digestive  efficiency  of bulls and steers.
Preliminary  results  for the carcass  data showed  that the bulls pro­
duced slightly  more lean meat and less fat than the steers. Chemical  
analysis  of the edible  portion  of the carcass  showed  that bulls deposited  
more protein  and significanlty  less fat. Daily carcass  protein  gain was 
significantly  higher  for the bulls but daily carcass  energy  gain was not 
significantly  different.

THE GENETIC  IMPROVEMENT  OF LOWLAND  SHEEP  
J. P. HANRAHAN
The Agricultural  Institute,  Belclare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
The lowland  ewe population  in this country  consists  of purebred  ewes  
of lowland  breeds  (mainly  the Galway  breed)  and ewes derived  from the 
hill breeds (Blackface  Mountain  and Cheviot).  Since hill breeds con­
tribute  to the lowland  population,  their role must be examined  when  
considering  the genetic  improvement  of this population.  It is well estab ­
lished  that biological  efficiency  and economic  efficiency  are both strongly  
influenced  by variations  in the number  of lambs reared  per ewe. That  
this aspect  of our lowland  sheep  population  needs  to be improved  is clear  
when our ewe flock performance  is compared  with that of the United  
Kingdom  and N. Ireland. The following  results  emerge  when the per­
formance  of lowland  spring  lambing  flocks  is examined  :
No. of lambs  reared  per ewe to the ram
U.K.  — 1.43
N. Ireland  — 1.35
Ireland  — 1.20
Our level of output  per ewe is 20% below  that in the U.K. From  the 
results of ewe breed comparisons  in Ireland  and the U.K., it can be 
concluded  that most of the difference  between  the two countries  is due 
to the genetic  limitations  of our main lowland  breed —the Galway.
A long term selection  experiment  for increased  litter size has been 
underway  in a Galway  flock since 1964 and to-date  a response  of 15% 
has been achieved.  However,  while  this shows  that within  breed selection 
can increase  litter size, the rate of improvement,  when  viewed  against  the 
required  improvement  in the national  flock, is such that this approach  
is not likely  to generate  appreciable  change  in the national  Galway  flock  
before  the end of the present  century.  Consequently,  immediate  improve ­
ment of the Galway  breed  must be pursued  through  crossing  to introduce  
genes for increased  prolificacy.  Results  under research  and commercial  
conditions  have shown  that f Galway  x ^ Finn ewes give an increase  of
0.3 to 0.4 in litter size compared  with the Galway.  In addition,  gross 
margin  per ewe has increased  by up to 40%.
It is concluded  that, since the hill breeds  are more prolific  than Gal­
ways (under  lowland  conditions),  crossbred  ewes from hill breed  mothers  
should  form as large a portion  as possible  of the lowland  population.  The 
remainder  of the lowland  flock shou ’d be improved  Galway  types like the 
J Galway  x J Finn. If this objective  was attained  and improved  ram 
strains  were used as sires of the crossbred  ewes, then lambs  reared  per 
ewe could be rapidly  increased  to 1.45 for our lowland  sheep  industry.

Newcasle  P.O., Co. Dublin.
During  the autumn  of 1977, 46 adult ewes were treated  with a horse  
anterior  pituitary  extract  (HAP)  in association  with intravaginal  proges ­
tagen to induce multiple  ovulation.  The ewes were bred by artificial  
insemination  at a predetermined  time after the end of HAP treatment.  
Prostaglandins  (PGF 2Q! and E2) were added to the diluted  semen used 
in the insemination  of 17 sheep. Laparotomies,  performed  for the pur­
pose of egg recovery,  showed that all of the inseminated  ewes had 
ovulated,  shedding  a total of 362 eggs of which 246 were recovered.  
Addition  of prostaglandins  to semen resulted  in a significantly  higher  
percentage  of fertilized  eggs.
A total of 43 fertilized  eggs which had been stored in the ligated 
rabbit  oviduct  were transferred  at rates of one to four {ter animal  to the 
uterine  horns of 18 adult recipient  ewes using local anaesthesia  and a 
laparotomy  crad'e  for rapid egg transfer;  12 ewes became  pregnant  with 
a total of 25 foetuses.
FACTORS  AFFECTING  OESTROUS  BEHAVIOUR  IN BEEF
CATTLE
SHEELAGH  O’LEARY  and J. F. ROCHE  
The Agricultural Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Difficulty  in detecting  oestrus is a limiting  factor in the use of 
artificial  insemination  in beef cattle. Oestrus  behaviour  was induced  in 
ovariectomised  (OVX)  beef heifers  using  oestradiol  cyclopentylpropionate  
(ECP)  and the time from ECP injection  to onset  of oestrus  behaviour  and 
the duration  of oestrous  behaviour  was recorded.
ECP administration  at various  times in relation  to the removal  of a 
progesterone  releasing  intravaginal  device  (PRID)  showed  that adminis ­
tering  ECP 24 hours  before  PRID  removal  significantly  increases  the time 
from ECP injection  to onset of oestrous  behaviour.  An injection  of 
progesterone  at the onset of oestrous  behaviour  significantly  shortened  
its duration  in OVX heifers  given ECP but did not shorten  the duration  
of oestrus  following  PRID  removal  in intact  heifers.  In the intact  heifers, 
the interval  from the end of oestrus  to ovulation  was longer in those  
that received  progesterone  at the onset of oestrus  than in those that did 
not.
Subjecting  the OVX heifers  to stress before ECP injection  did not 
affect either the time from ECP injection  to the onset of oestrus  behav ­
iour or the duration  of oestrus  behaviour.

HALOTHANE  SENSITIVITY  AND MEAT  QUALITY  IN 
IRISH  PIGS

The improvement  of the pig as an efficient  meat producing  animal  
has been associated  with two closely  related  problems,  namely,  an in­
crease  in the susceptibility  to stress  which  may cause  sudden  death  during  
handling  and transport  for example,  and an increasing  incidence  of pale,  
soft and exudative  (PSE)  meat which  is an undesirable  raw material  for 
manufacturing  processes.
In recent  years Dutch  research  workers  have found  that stress  suscep ­
tible pigs show an adverse  reaction  to the anaesthetic  gas halothane.  As 
a result of this, a specific  test has been developed  whereby  pigs which  
react positively  to halothane  are considered  to be susceptible  to stress 
and likely  to produce  PSE meat.
A total of 464 young pigs entering  one of the two national  testing  
stations  have been subjected  to the ‘halothane  test ’ between  October  
1976 and February  1978, comprising  350 Landrace,  66 Large  White  and 
48 Irish Welsh. The average  weight  at testing  was 24,5 kg. A total of 19 
pigs reacted  positively  to the test, 16 (4.6%)  of the Landrace  and 3 (6.3%)  
of the Irish Welsh. No reactors  were found  in the Large  White  breed.
Meat quality  data in the form of pHj readings  were analysed  for 549 
pigs (castrates,  females  and culled boars) from the two national  test 
stations  for the period  May 1976 to January  1977. The mean  pH, values  
were 6.14 ± .02 (258 pigs), 6.31 ± .02 (284 pigs) and 6.12 ± .12 (7 pigs)  
in the Landrace,  Large White and Irish Welsh  breeds  respectively.  The 
pH, in eight slaughtered  reactor  pigs was 5.88.
While the incidence  of reactors  was relatively  low in Ireland,  it was 
concluded  that in order to prevent  an increase  in the incidence  of halo­
thane sensitivity  and the undesirable  effects  associated  with this condition,  
all young boars of the Landrace  and Irish Welsh breeds  submitted  for 
performance  testing  should  be routinely  tested with halothane,  and that 
reactors  should  be culled.

EFFECT  OF TEMPERATURE  AND HUMIDITY  ON SOWS  
AND LITTERS
P. B. LYNCH
The Agricultural  Institute,  Moore  park, Fermoy.
Two experiments  were carried  out in controlled  environment  rooms  
at Moorepark.  The first experiment  involved  16 sows at each of two 
temperatures  27°C and 16°C from day 110 of pregnancy  to weaning  at 
31 days old. Sow feed intake  was significantly  higher  (P<0.01)  and lacta ­
tion weight  loss lower (P<0.05)  at 16° C. The newborn  pigs at 16°C  
had lower rectal temperatures  at 12 hrs (P<0.01)  and 36 hrs of age 
(P<0.05),  and were heavier  at weaning  (P<0.05).  Sow respiration  rate 
and rectal temperature  were higher at 27°C both before farrowing  
(P<0.01,  P<0.10  respectively)  and after farrowing  (P<0.01  and P<0.05).
In the second  experiment  two levels  of humidity  75-80%  and 67-70% 
RH were compared  at 27°C with 24 sows on each treatment.  None  of the 
parameters  measured  including  sow feed intake,  sow weight loss, sow 
respiration  rate and rectal  temperature,  was significantly  affected  by treat ­
ment.
INHIBITORY  SUBSTANCES  IN MILK
F. H. AUSTIN
Department  of Veterinary  Medicine  and Pharmacology,  
University  College,  Dublin.
The presence  of antibiotics  in milk is an inevitable  consequence  of the 
treatment  of dairy cows with these drugs. The persistence  of antibiotic  
residues  depends  upon the antibiotic  itself, the complete  formulation  of 
the product,  the route of administration  to the animal  and is further  sub­
ject to wide individual  variations  within  the animal  itself.
There is intense  competition  in the veterinary  antibiotic  market  with 
at least 40 separate  organisations  marketing  their own brand of product.  
There  are at least 70 different  formulations  of intramammary  tubes  on the 
market  with a further  86 or more injectable  preparations  of antibiotics.  
Each one of these products  require  to be tested to determine  effective  
withholding  times for milk.
The market  requirement  for milk is that it should  be free from anti­
biotics,  i.e. there is a zero tolerance  set for the presence  of antibiotics  in 
milk. Reputable  scientists  recognise  that this is a scientific  impossibility  
and merely  means  that no antibiotic  must be detected  in milk irrespec ­
tive of what test is used. The tests used to detect antibiotics  in milk 
are generally  non-specific  in nature  and are referred  to as tests for inhibi ­
tors. The TTC and Inter tests have been widely  accepted  both here and 
in the U.K. for a number  of years. However,  a newer  more sensitive  test 
known  as the DELVO  P test is now gaining  broad  acceptance  in Ireland  
and is creating  problems  for the pharmaceutical  industry,  the milk pro­
ducer  and the consumer.  Attempts  to clarify  some of the issues  involved 
were discussed.
