Influence  of Pasture  Type on 
Animal  Production
V. CONNOLLY
Agricultural  Institute.  Oakpark,  Carlow.
The influence  of pasture  type on animal  production  has been the subject  
of much research  and debate  for many years. There  are some aspects  on 
which there is general  agreement.  For example,  pastures  with a good 
white  clover  balance  are more productive  than those without  this legume.  
In Ireland  and U.K. the more productive  pastures  have reasonably  high 
levels of ryegrass.  There is much less agreement  on other aspects  such 
as the relative  merits  of different  varieties  of ryegrass.  Differences  be­
tween ryegrass  varieties  in terms  of dry matter  yield under frequent  and 
infrequent  cutting  are well established.  There is, however,  no reliable  
way in which productivity  under cutting  can be translated  into animal  
performance.
The results  presented  in this paper  deal with the relative  performance  
of four varieties  of ryegrass  measured  in terms  of animal  production  over 
a period  of six years. Three stocking  rates were imposed  on each of the 
four varieties  as follows  :
Varieties :
— Tailteann : Early Poor persistency
— S24 : Early Good persistency
— S23 Late Good persistency
— Reveille
Stocking  rates : (at 
— Low 
— Medium  - High: Early
turn-out) kg/ha
2,000
2,500
3,000Tertaploid,  medium  
persistency
In such experiments  it is necessary  to include  varying  stocking  levels 
in order to arrive at valid conclusions.  This is the reason  for the very 
high stocking  rates which  severely  depress  animal  performance.
The level of nitrogen  fertiliser  use was 245 kg/ha/annum  in five 
applications.  The duration  of the grazing  season  was from the first week 
of April to the first week  of November  and the grazing  cycle  was 20 days. 
Stocking  rates were reduced  by 45% in July after five grazing  cycles.
Results
Liveweight  gain from each variety  averaged  over stocking  rates for 
each year is shown  in Table  I. Productivity  was high. On the best treat ­
ments  (Reveille  and S 23 medium  stocking  rate) production  was never

less than 1100 kg/ha  liveweight  gain in any year. The first year (1975)  
showed  a very high level of production,  this is a phenomenon  frequently  
associated  with new re-seeds  where  the performance  in the initial  year is 
some 10-20%  higher  than in subsequent  seasons.
Differences  between  varieties  are summarised  in Table 2 in terms of 
carrying  capacity  relative  to S 24 = 100.

The main features  of these results  are :
S 23 and Reveille  were consistently  superior  in stock carrying  capacity  
to S24 and Tailteann  was poorer  than S 24 except  in the first harvest  year. 
The degree  of superiority  of S 23 and Reveille  over the whole season  is 
about 10% relative  to S 24 and about 16% relative  to Tailteann.  Dry 
matter  yield data over a period  of two years  obtained  by frequent  cutting  
of these four varieties  in a separate  experiment  are presented  in Table 3.
These  results  show that dry matter  yield as measured  by cutting  is not 
a good guide to animal  performance.
Seasonal  differences
The varieties  showed  large differences  in seasonal  production  and 
these are summarised  in Table 4. The grazing  season  was divided  into 
two periods  ; (1) April to July and (2) July to end of October.

♦ In 1975 Period  1 =80 days; stocking  rate was reduced  after four cycles  of grazing  
because  of drought  conditions.
Future capital  developments  include  the erection  of extra cubicles 
for beef cattle,  installation  of cubicles  in hayshed  for extra yearlings  and 
the extension  of the slatted  area for wintering  sheep.
These results  show that the stock carrying  capacity  of the tetraploid  
in the first period relative  to all other varieties  was very high. It is of 
interest  to note that S 23 (a late variety)  is better than S 24 (an early  
variety)  in this period  (with the exception  of 1975 when the duration  of 
Period  1 was shorter  than usual). This was due to two factors:
(1) Period  1 covers  the peak production  of all varieties;
(2) S 24 is not nearly  as good in terms of animal  production  in this 
early  period  as would  be expected  on the basis  of dry matter  yield  
data.
S 23 and Reveille  produced  similar  total annual  liveweight  gains and 
the differences  between  these two varieties  were mainly  seasonal. The 
seasonal  pattern  of growth  of these two varieties  is shown  in Fig. 1. The 
major disadvantage  of S 23 is low production  in the first 60 days after  
turn out while the main weakness  of Reveille  is low production  in the 
July/August  period.
Another  aspect  of seasonal  productivity  is summarised  in Table  5. This 
shows the proportion  of the total annual liveweight  gain which was 
obtained  in the period  April  - July (100 days). The results  demonstrate  
the degree to which production  is concentrated  into this early period. 
Even for a late variety  such as S 23, 75% or more of the total annual  
potential  liveweight  gain is obtained  at this time.

Although  the performance  of S 23 was superior  to the other varieties  
from mid-July  onwards,  the carrying  capacity  of all swards  during  this 
second  part of the grazing  season  was low. The stocking  rate reduction  
of 45% which  was made at this time was not great enough  to maintain  
liveweight  per animal  at a level comparable  to that of Period 1 at all 
stocking  levels.
Persistency
Table  6 summarises  the persistency  levels  of the four varieties.  These  
results  were based  on dry matter  yield of the sward  components.
As expected  S 23 showed  the highest  persistency  level. The tetraploid  
varieties  are generally  reputed  to have low persistency  levels. These  data 
show that Reveille  persisted  well at all stocking  rates and was equal to 
the values  obtained  for S 24.

Summary
The data collected  over six years show  that pasture  type as influenced  
by the sown  variety  has an effect  on animal  output. The results  obtained  
here are restricted  to a high nitrogen  input system. In a low nitrogen  
system where greater reliance  would be placed on clover then the 
superiority  of S 23 is likely to decrease  but the tetraploid  would very 
likely  retain  its position  because  it is compatible  with good clover  growth.  
The results  emphasise  the high animal  output  capacity  of some of the 
new tetraploid  varieties. The data refer specifically  to the earlier  tetra ­
ploid perennial  varieties  such as Reveille.  Greater  use of such tetraploids  
in mixtures  designed  primarily  for grazing  or one silage cut plus grazing  
would  seem desirable.

A Demonstration  of High  Beef Output  
on a Conimereial  Farm
E. NAUGHTON  
Moyliss,  Roscommon.
A. KILCLINE
Committee  of Agriculture,  Roscommon
In 1974 a three year trial was initiated  for the purpose  of demonstrating  
the effects  of stocking  rate on beef output  per acre. The trial was under ­
taken on part of E. Naughton ’s farm, in co-operation  with the Advisory  
Service  and Department  of Agriculture.
The farm consists  of 138 adjusted  acres and the soil type is a heavy 
brown  earth suitable  for all livestock  and tillage  enterprises.  Tradition ­
ally the farm in common  with other farms  in the vicinity  was an extensive 
dry stock/sheep  enterprise  farm. Fertilizer  application  has been increased  
over the past 10 years and pH and soil fertility  is currently  being main ­
tained  at a high level.
Layout  of trial
Cattle  were stocked  on the allocated  areas at three different  levels up 
to July when the stocking  rates were reduced  for the remainder  of the 
grazing  season. The details  were as follows :

Fertilizers
A basal dressing  of 3 cwt. 0.10.20  per ace was applied  in November.  
Application  of nitrogen  fertilizer  consisted  of;
2 cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all plots on March  1 
1 cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all plots in June/July  
1^ cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all ‘High ’ plots in July 
1 cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all plots in August/September
Results
Liveweight  gains per animal  and per acre are summarised  in Tables  
1 and 2. The results show that whilst the greatest  liveweight  gain per 
animal  was achieved  on the medium  stocking  rate, the highest  gain per 
acre was obtained  on the high stocking  rate.

It is concluded  that intensive  stocking  is feasible  on this farm, which  
is representative  of the surrounding  area, and that there is potential  for a 
much  greater  volume  of beef output  per acre than that achieved  in tradi ­
tional practice. To realise this objective,  the following  management  
details  are essential ;
1. Rest pasture  during  winter.
2. Maintain  soil fertility.
3. Apply  N fertilizer  six weeks  before  initial  grazing.
4. Good grass swarth  at time of cattle turnout.
5. Good  fencing  and water  supply.
12
6. Rest paddocks  before  grazing.
7. Control  of fluke and worms.
Farm development  plan
The development  plan, using  experience  gained  from the stocking  rate 
trial, is aimed  at extending  a high stocking  rate over the whole  farm. The 
development  is phased  as follows :

The targets  include  the production  of 85 beef cattle from weanling  
purchased  18 months  earlier,  the maintenance  of 160 ewes by 1981 and a 
tillage  rotation  to provide  the opportunity  for establishing  high yielding 
pastures.
For servicing  this expansion  in stock numbers  the following  capital  
programme  has been implemented :
• erection  of feeding,  housing  and slurry accommodation  for 60 
fattening  cattle;
• cubicles,  silo and slurry  pit for 30 weanlings;
• covered  slats for 100 ewes;
• farm roadway.

Reducing  Winter  Feed Costs  
in Beef Production
M. DRENNAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
The three most important  factors  which determine  the profitability  of 
fattening  cattle in winter  are;
1. Total feed costs.
2. Animal  performance.
3. The autumn  to spring  cattle price increase.
The total non-feed  cost of keeping  a fattening  animal  for a 140 day 
winter  period  will vary with circumstances  but for the present  discussion  
a figure of £55 is taken. Included  in this cost are total interest  charges,  
repayments  on building  and other overhead  costs,  transport  and market ­
ing, mortality  and dosing  costs. It is appreciated  that these costs may be 
substantially  lower in many instances  particularly  when repayments  on 
buildings  do not apply.
Cattle  price increases  are likely  to make smaller  contributions  to pro­
fits in the coming  years than in the recent  past and thus more emphasis  
will need to be placed  on feed costs and animal  performance.  The effects  
of these two factors  on returns  are shown in Table 1 where the price  
increase  is taken at only £5 per 100 kg. Using  this price increase  a daily  
gain of 0.7kg per day is required  in order to break-even  when total feed 
costs are as low as £50 for a 140 day winter  period. The data show that 
high rate of gain and low feed costs are very important  if profitability  is 
to be maximised.

Chemical  treatment  of straw
Methods  have been developed  whereby  the feeding  value of straw  
can be improved  by treating  it with a chemical.  Both sodium  hydroxide  
and ammonia  treatment  methods  have been investigated  at Grange  but
15
no data are available  on the latter method  with fattening  animals. The 
results  of a trial in which  fattening  bulls (400 kg initially)  were fed 5 kg 
concentrates  (75% barley, 23% soyabean  and 2% minerals/vitamins)  
per head daily and either untreated  or sodium  hydroxide  treated  barley  
straw  to appetite  is shown  in Table  2.

Livewt.  gain (kg) (187 days) 155 161
Carcass  gain (kg) 83 104
Daily straw DM intake (kg) 5.3 5.6
Although  there were only small differences  between  treatments  in live- 
weight gains the killing-out  percentages  of animals  fed the sodium 
hydroxide  treated  straw were significantly  greater  than when untreated  
straw was fed. Thus over 187-day  feeding  period  carcass  weight  gains 
of animals  fed untreated  and treated  straws  were 85 and 104 kg respec ­
tively. Daily straw  dry matter  intakes  were 5.3 and 5.6 kg for untreated  
and treated  material  respectively.  The dry matter  digestibility  of untreated  
and treated  straws  were 45 and 61% respectively.  While  digestibility  was 
improved  as a result of treatment  it should be noted that the final 
material  was of relatively  low feeding  value. When  the cost of treatment  
(about  £20 per tonne of straw)  and the increased  straw intake are con­
sidered  the increased  gain from treatment  is only about  sufficient  to meet 
the added  costs.
Fodder  beet roots
A number  of experiments  have been carried  out in which pulped  
fodder  beet roots were compared  with barley as a supplement  to grass 
silage for fattening  cattle. The silages  were fed to appetite  in each ex­
periment  and were in general  of high digestibility  and properly  preserved.
In six experiments,  silage was fed alone to one group  of animals  and 
a second  group  was fed supplementary  barley  (2^ kg in four experiments  
and 5.0 kg in the other two experiments)  with silage. Other treatment  
groups  received  a similar  level of supplementary  dry matter  as an alter ­
native to barley  either as fodder  beet alone or as fodder  beet/soyabean  
meal. A summary  of these experiments  is presented  in Tables  3 and 4. 
The results  show that when fodder  beet alone was fed the extra carcass  
produced  was only 57 percent  of that obtained  from a similar  level of 
supplementary  barley  dry matter. However,  as a supplement  to silage, 
fodder  beet/soyabean  meal gave additional  carcass  gains which were 91

that the depression  in silage intake from the same quantity  of supple ­
mentary  dry matter  was the same for the various  supplements.
Molasses
At present  prices  molasses  is a relatively  cheap  feed when compared  
with barley  as a supplement  for fattening  animals  fed high quality  silage.  
For the purpose  of the comparisons  molasses  was assumed  to have an 
energy  value 70 percent  of that in barley.  The supplements  fed with silage  were :
(1) 3.0 kg rolled barley.
(2) 4.3 kg molasses.
(3) 3.6 kg molasses  plus 0.45 kg soyabean  meal.
The results  in Table 5 show that when additional  protein  was pro­
vided as soyabean  meal the supplement  of molasses  gave carcass  gains  
similar  to that obtained  from barley.

Information  is lacking  where molasses  forms a higher  proportion  of the 
total diet and this aspect  is at present  being investigated.
Comparison  of different  diets for fattening  cattle
In order to examine  the possible  role of fodder  beet, molasses  and 
treated  straw in rations  for fattening  cattle, diets based on these feeds  
are compared.  The usable yields and production  costs of the various  
crops are shown  in Table  6.

This table shows that the high yield of fodder  beet per acre offsets  the 
higher  production  costs compared  with barley  and grass silage resulting  
in similar  costs per unit of feed energy  for the three crops. Three  diets  
using different  supplements  with silage  calculated  to produce  a daily gain

vitamins)  per animal  daily is compared  with these in Table  8 in terms  of 
feed costs and acres required  per 100 cattle  for a 140-day  feeding  period.

Using  diet A (based  on silage  and purchased  barley)  as standard,  feed 
costs per animal  is reduced  by £9.50 per head as a result of replacing  
purchased  barley  by molasses/soyabean  meal (diet B). The land require ­
ments  are similar  for diets A and B. While  the diet based  on fodder  beet 
is the most attractive,  it must be remembered  that production  costs are 
high and these results  are dependent  on high yields per acre. Although  
the diet based on treated  straw and concentrates  is only slightly  more  
expensive  than diet A the acreage  required  is increased  by almost  50 
percent  as all feed except  soyabean  meal is home produced  and per acre 
production  from barley  is low.
The data illustrate  the importance  of (a) obtaining  high yields  of high 
quality  inaterial  with home produced  feed and (b) the feed cost per unit 
of digestible  energy  with purchased  feeds.
Level  of barley  feeding  with silage
The optimum  level of barley for fattening  cattle fed silage depends  
on a number  of factors. To estimate  this level a brief summary  of feed­
ing experiments  carried  out at Grange  is now presented  and economic  
returns  are calculated,  using various  winter cattle price increases  and 
barley  prices.

The data presented  in Table  9 are the average  results  from a number  
of experiments  in which  cattle  were fed grass silage  alone  or with different  
levels of supplementary  barley. The responses  from feeding  1.8 and 3.6 
kg of barley  per animal  daily were then calculated  and adjusted  to a 140- 
day feeding  period. The responses  are shown  in Table 10.

Carcass  weight 10.9 20.0
The average  daily liveweight  gain of animals  fed silage  alone  was 0.57 
kg which  demonstrates  that moderate  to high quality  silages  were used in 
these studies. When calculated  over a 140-day  feeding  period,  animals  
fed 1.8 and 3.6 kg barley  daily gained  23 and 36 kg more carcass  weight 
than those  fed silage  alone. Feeding  1.8 and 3.6 kg barley  daily depressed  
silage  intakes  by 10.0 and 18.5 percent  respectively.  A good response  in 
terms of animal  performance  was obtained  from feeding  the first 1.8 kg 
of barley  daily but increasing  the levels of supplementation  from 1.8 to 
3.6 kg resulted  in a major decline  in the liveweight  and carcass  weight 
responses  to supplementation.

From these results,  the financial  returns  were calculated  for a farm  
example  involving  a winter  feeding  period  of 140-days  where  600 tonnes  
silage  are available.  The number  of cattle  (400 kg initially)  which  can be 
carried  for 140 days is 100, 111 and 123 where  0, 1.8 and 3.6 kg of barley 
are fed respectively.
In order  to place the returns  to barley  feeding  in their proper  prospec ­
tive, the financial  returns  from feeding  silage alone are shown  in Table  
11 using various  purchase  and selling prices. As used here, financial 
return  means  the difference  between  the sale price of animals  and cost of 
animals,  housing,  dosing  etc., including  the interest  on money  invested 
in these items where this is applicable.  A charge  for labour  is not in­
cluded  in the costs. This table shows that when silage only is fed, a 
winter  cattle price increase  of £8 to £9 per 100 kg. is required  to break ­
even. The price increase  required  to break-even  would  be greater  at lower
20
levels  of production.  The extra returns  obtained  from feeding  1.8 and 3.6 
kg of barley  per head daily with silage  are shown  in Table 12 when  barley  
is charged  at £105 per tonne.

Purchase  price £80 per 100 kg
The extra returns  from meal feeding  is the difference  between  that 
obtained  when barley  is fed and that obtained  when silage alone is fed. 
No charge  is made for additional  housing  where  extra cattle are carried  
as a result of meal feeding  because  it is assumed  that adequate  housing  
is available.
Although  feed costs per animal  are £43, £65 and £88 where  0, 1.8 and 
3.6 kg of barley are fed respectively  economic  returns  are improved  in 
all instances  from barley  feeding.  This improvement  in returns  illustrates  
the importance  of the increased  rates of gain obtained  from feeding  
barley. The optimum  level of barley  depends  on the cattle  price increase,  
with 3.6 kg only proving  as economical  as 1.8 kg when  the price increase  
is over £5 per 100 kg. However,  if barley  is charged  at £125 per tonne  
(Table 13) an extremely  high price increase  is required  in order  to justify  
the feeding  of 3.6 kg barley  per animal  daily.
Table 13

5 1089 312
10 1579 1245
Purchase  price £80 per 100 kg
This shows  that the cost of barley  becomes  increasingly  important  as the 
level of barley  feeding  is increased.  As interest  charges  are included  in 
the cost of barley and considering  the expected  price for finished  cattle
21
in spring  the optimum  level of barley  will be about 1.8 kg in many  cases.  
It should be noted however  that the above figures  do not include  the 
advantages  expected  from growth  promoters  which  substanially  improve 
returns  in all instances  as shown  in Table 14.

In this table it is assumed  that returns  are improved  by £20 per animal  
as a result  of the growth  promoters.
Conclusions
Apart from cattle price increases  the most important  factors  to con­
sider in obtaining  good returns  from winter  fattening  are :
1. High animal  performance.
2. High yields per acre of high quality  material  as illustrated  by fodder  
beet.
3. Low  cost per unit of feed energy  for purchased  feeds.

The Use of Growth  Promoters  
in Beef Cattle
J. F. ROCHE
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Growth  rate of animals  is affected  by many factors  such as previous  and 
present  plane of nutrition,  sex of animal,  breed,  environment,  season  and 
health  status. Bulls will grow faster than steers,  steers grow faster than 
heifers  and removal  of the ovaries  from heifers  further  depresses  growth  
rate. The effects  of sex on growth  rate are mediated  through  hormonal  
effects.
Because  of the known  effects of hormones  on growth  rate, various  
growth  promoting  implants  have been developed.  These  can be classified 
generally  as follows :
1. Oestrogens —female sex hormone —the manufacture,  preparation,  
packing  or sale of any animal  remedy  containing  oestrogen  to which  
the regulations  apply  is prohibited,  save under  licence  of the Minister  
for Agriculture.  Synovex-S  is the most common  one used in the U.K.  
This product  contains  progesterone  and oestradiol  and it has recently  
become  available  commercially  in Ireland,  through  veterinary  sur­
geons.
2. Androgens —male  sex hormones —these are similar  in action to tes­
tosterone  which is present  in bulls and trenbolone  acetate  (Finaplix)  
is the one most commonly  used.
3. Non-hormonal  compounds— simple  chemicals —affect  growth  rate and 
resorcylic  acid lactone  (Ralgro)  is the most common  one used in this 
category.
The commercially  available  growth  promoters  in Ireland  at present  
are shown  in Table 1.
Side effects
Ralgro  or Finaplix  have shown  no undesirable  side effects  following 
use, such as abnormal  behaviour,  raised  tail head, lactation  in males  etc. 
If Finaplix  was repeatedly  used, it is possible  that some male behavioural  
characteristics  would  develop.  These  two compounds  when used properly  
are safe to animal  and man.
Some side effects  have been reported  on the use of growth  promoters  
containing  oestrogens  (Synovex)  such as increase  in mounting,  riding,  in­
creased  aggression  and raised  tail heads. At time of insertion  of implants,  
it is important  that they are not crushed  or inserted  on wet days because  
there can be a greater  release  rate from the implant  resulting  in worse  
problems.  In addition,  it is important  not to mix implanted  cattle with 
strange  cattle  as this can trigger  off fresh behavioural  problems.

Mechanism  of action
Growth  promoters  generally  increase  tissue growth  and particularly  
muscle  growth  at the expense  of fat. There  appear  to be different  mechan ­
isms of action.
(i) Direct action of the compound  in the target tissue. The hormone  
binds  to a receptor  in the cell, thereby  initiating  a series  of reactions  
which  result in increases  in DNA  synthesis.  Androgens  work in this 
fashion  (Finaplix).
(ii) Indirect  action  on the brain and pituitary  gland  resulting  in increased  
release  of growth  hormone.  Growth  hormone  then acts on target  
tissue as just described  to increase  protein  synthesis.  Ralgro  and 
oestrogens  appear  to work in this manner.
The net result  is an increase  in nitrogen  retention  in the tissue  and a 
decrease  in urinary  excretion  rate of nitrogen. Thus, these com­
pounds  work  more  by increasing  efficiency  of conversion  of food into 
muscle  than by increasing  feed intake.
Use of either  compound  once
It is claimed  that either Ralgro  or Finaplix  will increase  growth  rate 
and feed efficiency  in animals  on pasture  or fed on roughage  and con­
centrate  diets. Experiments  have been carried  out at Grange  and Ballina-  
lack on finishing  steers and results  to date for Ralgro  are summarized  in 
Table 2 and for Finaplix  in Table 3. Ralgro  significantly  increased  the 
mean liveweight  gain. There was variation  in liveweight  gain from trial 
to trial of the order of 0 to 20% increase  with an average  increase  of 
10%. Carcass  weight  was also increased  by a mean  of 7 kg. over controls.

Experiments  with Finaplix  show no significant  increase  in liveweight

14% increase  over controls.  Likewise,  mean  carcass  weight  was increased  
by 6 kg. over controls  in these trials.

Repeated  use of Ralgro
Trials were carried  out to determine  if a second  implant  of Ralgro  
60 days after the first will give a further  increase  in performance.  Five 
hundred  and sixteen  animals  on four farms, mainly  Friesian  X, were 
allocated  to three groups : (1) untreated,  (2) Ralgro  at start of experiment  
and (3) Ralgro  at start and repeated  after 60 days. The minimum  length  
of treatment  on any farm was 130 days.

There  was variation  from farm to farm but from the above  results  in 
Table 4 it does not appear  worthwhile  to re-use Ralgro  60 days after 
the first implantation.  Whether  or not a response  would be obtained  to 
the second  implant  if a longer  interval  was used has not been tested.
Trials were carried  out in the winter  of 1975 on 815 finishing  beef 
steers  fed on silage and concentrates  to determine  if either  implant  alone  
or if both together  would  affect daily liveweight  gain and carcass  weight.  
The animals  were allocated  at random  into four groups :
Group 1; Untreated  controls.
Group  2: Ralgro  given  at start of experiment.
Group  3: Finaplix  given  about  30 days after start of experiment.  
Group  4: Combination  treatment  of Ralgro  initially  followed  by Fina ­
plix in about  30 days.
Animals  were weighed  throughout  the experiment  and the mean and 
daily liveweight  gains are given  in Table  5. Either  growth  promoter  alone  
gave a significant  increase  in growth  rate. The combination  treatment  
gave a further  additive  increase  in growth  rate over either  compound  used 
alone and this was significant.  Carcass  weights  were available  for 596 
animals  on two farms and the mean carcass  weights  for groups 1, 2, 3 
and 4 respectively  were 310 ± 2.05, 319 ± 2.01, 316 ± 2.01 and 328 ± 2.04. 
Animals  on the first farm were slaughtered  after 98 days and after 135 
days on the second  farm. Again  significant  increases  in carcass  weights 
over ‘controls ’ for either compound  were obtained  and the combination  
treatment  gave a further  significant  increase.

Can Ralgro  and Finaplix  be inserted  on the same day ?
A trial was conducted  to determine  whether  it was necessary  when 
using the combination  of Ralgro  and Finaplix  to wait 30 days before
28
inserting  Finaplix.  There were 423 animals  on two farms allocated  at 
random  to 3 groups :
(1) Control  group.
(2) Implanted  with Ralgro  at start of experiment  followed  in about 30 
days by Finaplix.
(3) Implanted  with both Ralgro  and Finaplix  at start of the experiment.  
There  was a significant  (P<0.01)  increase  in final liveweight  and daily
liveweight  gain of steers treated  with growth  promoters  compared  with 
controls  (Table 6). Animals  were slaughtered  after mean duration  of 
132 days. There was also a significant  (P<0.001)  increase  in carcass  
weight  of treated  steers  compared  with controls.  There  was no difference 
in final liveweight  gain or carcass  weight  for steers receiving  both com­
pounds  on the same or different  days. Thus, both compounds  can be 
inserted  on the same day and still get the same effect as inserting  them  
30 days apart.

Repeated  use of Ralgro  and Finaplix
A trial was carried  out to determine  if re-implanting  steers  65-70  days 
later with Ralgro  and Finaplix  further  increased  growth  rate compared  
to steers  given the combination  treatment  once. There  were 453 animals  
on three farms  allocated  at random  to three  groups :
(i) Control.
(ii) Implanted  with Ralgro  and Finaplix  at start of experiment.
(iii) Implanted  with Ralgro  and Finaplix  at start of experiment  and re­
implanted  with Ralgro  and Finaplix  65-70  days later.
Re-implantation  65-70  days after initial implantation  significantly  in­
creased  final liveweight,  daily liveweight  gain and carcass  weight  com­
pared to steers given the combination  treatment  once (Table 7). This 
treatment  should  only be considered  where  animals  are being kept for at 
least 130 days and are on a high plane of nutrition  from start of treat ­
ment.

Effectiveness  at pasture
The purpose  of the next experiment  was to determine  whether  results 
being achieved  on silage and concentrates  over the winter  months  could 
be obtained  when animals  were on pasture.  At the start of the experi ­
ment,  all implants  were inserted  into the base of the ear.
Either growth promoter  when used alone significantly  (P <; 0.05)  
increased  final liveweight  and daily liveweight  gain (Table  8). Resorcylic  
acid significantly  (P < 0.01) increased  carcass  weight but trenbolone  
acetate  did not. The reason  for this discrepancy  is not clear. The use of 
both growth  promoters  again gave significant  (P<0.01)  increase  in final 
liveweight,  daily liveweight  gain and carcass  weight  compared  either  with 
both compounds  used alone or compared  with performance  of control  
steers.

Use in female  cattle
In contrast  to the results  in steers,  the results  in heifers  or cull cows  
are not as clear and can be summarized  as follows :
(1) Marginal  response  obtained.

(2) Ralgro  and Finaplix  not additive.
(3) Finaplix  is the implant  recommended.
(4) Monensin  could  also be considered  for use as a feed additive.
Use in calves  and weanlings
Ralgro  is the growth  promoter  one would consider  using in calves. 
Two trials have been carried  out to date in uncastrated  calves  from 3-5 
months  of age. Calves  in Trial 1 were Friesian  bull calves  while  those in 
Trial 2 were multiple  suckled  Friesian  or Charolais  cross animals. The 
liveweight  gain of control  and Ralgro  treated  animals  respectively  were
57.5 ± 1.9, 60.9 ± 1.9 in Trial 1 and 89.7 + 1.9 and 86.6 ± 1.9 in Trial 2. 
No increase  in daily liveweight  gain was obtained  in these  trials  with bull 
calves. However,  in other trials with steer calves  we have got a 10-15%  
increase  in growth  rate in calves varying  in age from ten days to four 
months.

One trial has been carried out in Ballinalack  on 8-9 month old 
Friesian  bulls with Ralgro. Animals  were allocated  at random  to two 
groups  of 26 each : (1) untreated  control  and (2) treated  with Ralgro.  
The initial and final liveweights  after 88 days were 189 and 222 kg. for 
control  weanlings  and 191 and 225 kg. for weanlings  given Ralgro.  From  
these limited  trials with uncastrated  calves or weanlings,  no effect of 
Ralgro  on liveweight  gain was obtained.
Feed intake
Experiments  have been carried  out in Grange  to determine  whether  
implanted  steers have a parallel  increase  in feed intake in relation  to 
increased  level of weight  gain. Either  Ralgro  or Ralgro  + Finaplix  in­
creased  feed intake by 2-4%. Thus, growth  promoters  work mainly  by 
increasing  conversion  of feed into meat.
31
Carcass  composition
The results of commercial  vacuum  pack cutting  for estimating  the 
weights  of lean meat, fat trim and bone are shown in Table 9. The 
increase  in carcass  weight  following  Ralgro  and Finaplix  is mainly  lean 
meat, a result similar  to that in bulls. In contrast,  there is the normal  
increase  in fat and lean in the carcass  following  Romensin,  a situation  
comparable  to that in steers  given more energy.
Possible  combinations  to use
In steers  the following  combinations  can be used ;
1. Female  + male growth  promoters:  the two are additive  for example,  
Ralgro  + Finaplix,  Synovex  + Finaplix.
2. A growth  promoter  + feed additive : the two are additive  for example,  
Ralgro  + Romensin,  Synovex  + Romensin.
3. Fernale  + male growth  promoter  + feed additive : the three are not 
additive  to date, for example,  Ralgro  + Finaplix  + Romensin.
In female  cattle Relgro  + Finaplix  are not additive;  use either Fina ­
plix or Romensin.
Factors  affecting  response  to growth  promoters
Response  is affected  by plane of nutrition  and animals  should be 
gaining  at least 0.5 kg per day in order to get a good response  from 
growth  promoters.  Where  animals  gained  less than 6.25 kg. per day, the 
response  was very poor. Therefore,  growth  promoters  can be used on 
finishing  cattle fed on good quality  silage  and concentrates  or in animals  
turned  out to grass from April to July. MFC  results  from the U.K. indi­
cate that the best growth  responses  were obtained  in animals  which  were 
implanted  at turnout  to grass in spring. Response  is also affected  by sex; 
it is clear from the data that steers show larger  responses  than heifers  or 
cull cows. It is also clear that in order to achieve  maximum  response  
cattle must be free of endo and ectoparasites.
Residues  of growth  promoters
Many  of the anabolic  compounds  used in animal  production  have the 
effect of altering  the levels  of the natural  growth  hormones  in the animal.  
Natural  hormones  are safe to use provided  that levels in blood  and tissue 
do not exceed  the normal  levels found under a variety  of physiological 
situations.
Synovex-S  implants  increased  the levels of oestradiol  17 beta in 
plasma  after implantation.  Levels  were still raised  60 days after implan ­
tation but by 120 days the levels were similar  to that in non-implanted  
steers. Finaplix  residues  of trenbolone  acetate  have been found in vari­
ous tissues  63 days after implantation  in amounts  similar  or lower than 
normal  levels of testosterone  in bulls. Ralgro  is absorbed  slowly at a 
fairly*  constant  rate from the implants.  Using  tritium  labelled  resorcylic 
acid safe amounts  of residues  were found  in muscle,  liver, kidney  and fat 
65 days after implantation.
32
Limitations
1. Animals  must not be slaughtered  for 60-65 days after implantation  in 
order  to ensure  that residues  are low or undetectable  in meat.
2. Breeding  males or females  must not be treated  with hormonal  type 
growth  promoters.
3. Insert implants  in the ear only as there is a residual  amount  of com­
pound  at the site of implantation  for many months.  Since the ear is 
disposed  of, this does not create  any hazard.
4. There  is variation  from farm to farm in response  obtained.
5. Fluctuations  in beef prices  should  be borne  in mind when deciding  to 
use implants.  If beef prices  suddenly  decline  treated  cattle  should  not 
be sold until the recommended  withdrawal  period  has elapsed.
The Ralgro  + Finaplik  combination  is effective  for about 120-130  
days. Thereafter,  the animals  will gain weight  at the normal  rate. The 
only limitation  on date of slaughter  is to ensure  that the recommended  
withdrawal  period  has elapsed.
Conclusions
Growth  promoters  produce  an economic  response  in steers but they 
must be used properly.  In finishing  beef cattle the use of growth  pro­
moters  is one effective  way to improve  profitability.  Thus, every effort  
must be made to ensure  that this aid remains  available  to beef producers  
by proper  use of the compounds.

Recent  Developments  in 
Dairy  Cow Nutrition
P. A. GLEESON
The Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark,  Fernioy,  Co. Cork.
The major ingredients  of the dairy cow ’s diet are grass (60%),  silage  
(30%)  and concentrates  (10%).  The importance  of silage  quality,  quantity  
and good preservation  was discussed  by the author  in this Journal  in 
1978, Volume  13, page 65. This paper describes  in more detail the use 
of concentrates  in the diet of the dairy cow. In addition  the age and 
weight  at first calving  of heifers  are discussed.
Energy  content  of the diet
Presently  many feeds for ruminants  are expressed  as Mega Joules  
(M.J.)  of Metabolisable  Energy  (M.E.)  per kilogram  of dry matter. From  
these values  the energy  content  of the diet can be determined.  Most pub­
lications  only contain  a mean value of the individual  feed ingredients.  
However,  great variations  can occur.
The energy  value of the formulated  diet is influenced  by the oil con­
tent, fibre level, ash and dry matter  content  of the ration. High fibre 
values  will reduce  the feeding  value as will high levels  of ash and mois ­
ture in the diet. Increasing  the oil level will tend to increase  the energy 
value of the ration. Fats or oils contain  a high gross energy level 
(approximately  39 M.J./kg)  as compared  with protein  or carbohydrate  
(approximately  17.1 M.J./kg)  and the feeding  of fat or oil is a potential  
method  of increasing  energy  intake. High energy  diets are essential  for 
high yielding  cows in early lactation  due to their low intake  capacity  at 
this time. Fat or oils can be fed in either  protected  or unprotected  form. 
The purpose  of protecting  the fat is to reduce  the breakdown  of fat in the 
rumen. The protection  is achieved  by encapsulating  the fat droplet  in a 
layer  of aldehyde  treated  protein.  The research  findings  on feeding  unnro-  
tected fat are variable.  In general  data suggest  that with roughage  diets  
the effect of high inclusion  of fat in the diet does not give increased  
output  of milk.
The effect  of tallow  added  to a concentrate  diet was studied  at Moore ­
park. A preparation  containing  tallow  and protein  (75 :25) was prepared  
as a fine mix and a ration  formulated  to contain  9% oil in the concen ­
trate was compared  with a control  ration  containing  3.75%  oil.
Thirty  spring  calving  cows were fed al libitum  silage plus 7.25 kg of 
a 16% protein  ration for a three week preliminary  period  after calving 
and were then assigned  to either  of three treatments  for an eight week  
experimental  period  as follows :
(1) Ad libitum  silage plus 7.25 kg of dairy ration ( 18% CP) normal  
energy.
35
(2) Ad libitum  silage plus 7.25 kg of dairy ration  (18% CP) including 
added  fat (high energy).
(3) Ad libitum  silage plus 6.6 kg of dairy ration (18% CP) including 
added fat but energy  intake of the concentrate  is equalised  to the 
level of treatment  1. The composition  of the dairy rations  are shown 
in Table 1 and the chemical  composition  in Table  2.

Energy  concentration  (M.J./kg  DM) 12.8 13.8
Both rations  were of good quality,  low in fibre and ash and high in dry 
matter  concentration.  The energy  density  of both rations  was high 11 5 
M.J./kg  as fed for the control  and 12.5 M.J./kg  for the high energy  
ration.
The results  are presented  in Table 3. Group  A, receiving  7.25 kg of 
the control  ration,  had a similar  performance  to Group  C, receiving  6.60 
kg of the high energy  ration,  in milk yield,  fat yield,  protein  yield,  fat %, 
protein  % and liveweight  changes.  Group  B receiving  7.25 kg of the high 
energy  ration produced  significantly  more milk than Group  C and also 
more fat and protein.  There  was no significant  difference  between  A and
36
B in any of the parameters  measured.  A digestibility  trial was carried  
out in conjunction  with the experiment  but there were no differences  in 
the digestibility  of the dry matter,  energy  or fibre on any of the 3 diets.

The results  of this trial would not justify  the inclusion  of tallow  at 
high levels in dairy rations  to increase  energy  density.  It must be noted  
that the control  ration  was of high quality  and possibly  greater  dilTerences  
might  occur if this were not so. The results  emphasize  that it is possible  
to formulate  high quality  rations  with normal  ingredients,  available  to 
the compounding  industry  without  resorting  to the inclusion  of high fat 
levels in the diet which may cause digestive  upsets  and reduced  digesti ­
bility of the diet. The form of the added  fat or oil may also be important  
but the best responses  obtained  from the addition  of high levels  of fat or 
oil in the diet is when they are protected  by the addition  of aldehyde  
treated  protein  to encapsulate  the fat droplets.
The protein  content  of dairy rations
The two major components  in concentrate  rations  are energy and 
protein,  but minerals  and vitamins  are also included.  There  is little criti­
cal information  available  on nutritive  value of silage protein  and on 
protein  supplementation  of grass silage. In many silages,  50% of the 
crude protein  is composed  of non-protein  nitrogen.  Under  such circum ­
stances,  although  the crude  protein  intake  of the cow maybe  theoretically  
adequate,  there maybe  a response  to additional  protein.  In two feeding 
trials at Moorepark  involving  180 individually  fed cows, the effect of 
varying  the protein  content  of the concentrate  was examined  with average  
and poor quality  silage  as the basal feeds. Concentrates  were formulated  
to contain  three levels of protein  (12, 15 and 18%) and were fed at 3.0,
5.5 and 8.0 kg per day to nine groups  of cows with each silage. The 
concentrates  were composed  of barley  and soyabean,  and contained  2% 
mineral  vitamin  mixture.  The experimental  feeding  period  in early lac­
tation was eight weeks,  and cows then uniformally  treated  on pasture  
for 12 weeks. In Table  4 the milk yields  for the eight week experimental  
period  and for the period 1-20 weeks are presented  and in addition  the
37
margins  over concentrate  costs are also shown. The price of the con­
centrates  was adjusted  in relation  to the crude protein  concentrations  in 
the diet. The results  indicate  that there is little response  to protein  at the 
low level of feeding.  However,  when the feeding  levels increased  to the
5.5 and 8 kg per day there was a response  in all cases from 12 to 15% 
crude protein  and only at the higher  feeding  levels was there a response 
from going  from 15 to 18% crude  protein.  The results  presented  in Table  
4 are data from one of the silages  fed in this experiment.  When  the results  
of both experiments  are examined  it is concluded  that a feeding  level of 
7 kg a day at 16% crude protein  is the most economic  at the present  
feed price-milk  ratio. However,  if feeding  levels exceed 8 kg a day 
it maybe  beneficial  to Increase  the level of protein  to 18%. The data 
further  suggest,  particularly  in the eight week experimental  period,  an 
inter-changeability  between  energy  and protein.  This is illustrated  when 
the feeding  level of 5.5 kg per day at 18% crude  protein  is compared  with 
the 8 kg feeding  level at 12% protein  where  similar  milk production  was 
obtained  for both groups. This result occured  in both experiments.  The 
protein  content  of a concentrate  had no effect on silage intake. As the 
level of concentrate  feeding  increased  the intake  of silage  was significantly 
decreased.  Liveweight  changes  during  the eight week experimental  period 
reflected  the level of feeding  with greater  body weight  loss occuring  at 
the lower  feeding  levels. Milk fat and milk protein  percentages  were not 
affected  by the level of protein  in the concentrate.  As would  be expected,  
milk protein  percentage  increased  with the level of concentrate  feeding.

Flat versus  variable  feeding
levels  of concentrates  to spring  calving  dairy cows
There  is much  discussion  at the present  time on the methods  of feed­
ing concentrates  to dairy cows. This mainly  arises from the higher  milk
38
yields presently  been obtained  on many dairy farms. Many people  con­
clude  that with higher  yields  it is necessary  to allocate  the concentrates  in 
relation  to yield. This has resulted  in the installation  of feeders  into many  
milking  parlours  to allow allocation  of concentrates  in relation  to yield.  
The inclusion  of feeders  in parlours  may be for the purpose  of overcom ­
ing the problems  of handling  large quantities  of concentrates  for dairy  
herds. An experiment  has been carried  out at Moorepark  comparing  the 
feeding  of fixed levels of concentrates  to lactating  cows with varying 
concentrate  feeding  levels in relation  to yields. One group of cows was 
fed 7.3 kg of concentrates  per cow per day for an eight week period  while 
a second group was fed the same total quantity  of concentrates  but 
allocated  to each cow in proportion  to her yield. The milk yields of the 
cows in each group  varied  between  3^ to 6 gallons  at the initiation  of the 
experiment.  The results  of the experiment  are presented  in Table 5.
Table 5

Milk protein % 3.10 3.08
Silage dry matter  intake as percent  of 
bodyweight 1.61 1.40
Liveweight  change  (kg/day) 0.06 -0.32
The results indicate  that there was no significant  difference  in milk 
yields or milk composition  for either treatment.  It can be concluded  
from this experiment  that provided  there is no undue competition  for 
concentrates  at the feeding  trough  there is no nutritional  justification  for 
including  expensive  methods  of feeding  in dairy farming.  Close  examina ­
tion of the data show that those cows on the variable  feeding  rate receiv ­
ing the higher  levels of feed reduced  their silage intake as the level of 
concentrates  increased,  and similarly  those on the lower feeding  levels  
tended  to eat more silage.
Age and weight  at first calving
Due to the seasonal  calving  nature  of the Irish Dairy  Industry  heifers 
entering  the dairy herd calve at two or three years of age. The effect of 
both age and weight  at first calving  is being studied  at the Agricultural  
Institute  Field Station,  Ballyragget,  Co. Kilkenny.  Friesian  spring  calving  
heifers  have been divided  into four treatment  groups  to compare  the effect  
of weight  at first calving  on lactation  performance.  Two groups  had a
39
target weight  of 450 kg weight  before  calving  and were stocked  at 0.95 
and 0.75 acres per animal  after calving.  The other  two groups  were also 
stocked  at 0.95 or 0.75 and had a target  weight  of 525 kg before  calving.  
These  stocking  rates provide  grazing  and silage  requirements.  Three  year 
old calving  heifers  were also stocked  at either  0.95 and 0.75 animals  per 
acre and had a pre-calving  weight  of 565 kg. The two year old calvers 
completed  three lactations  by the end of 1978 and the three year olds 
have completed  two lactations.  For ease of presentation  the stocking  rate 
groups  are combined  and the results  are summarised  in Table  6.

In the first lactation  the two year olds weighing  525 kg produced  sub­
stantially  more milk than two year olds calving  at 450 kg. During  the 
summer  and autumn  of 1976 feed supplies  were scarce  and these animals  
had little opportunity  to gain weight  between  the first and second  lacta ­
tions, and their pre-calving  weight  in 1977 differed  very little from their  
pre-calving  weight  in 1976. This resulted  in a disappointing  milk perfor ­
mance  during 1977. However  during  that period  the animals  increased  
substantially  in body-weight  as indicated  by their pre-calving  weight  at 
the start of 1978. The milk production  performance  in 1978 increased  
substantially  over the 1977 figures. To date the heavier  two year old 
calvers  have over a 100 gallons  more milk produced  at the end of the 
third lactation.  Delaying  calving  to three years of age did not greatly  
improve  the milk lactation  performance  in the first lactation.  Modest  
milk increases  between  first and second  lactation  were recorded  for these  
three year old calving  heifers  even though  they did increase  in weight 
between  first and second  lactations.  The two and three year old calvers 
were born in the same year but the milk production  at the end of 1978 
shows  that the three year old calvers  have 600 gallons  less milk produced  
than the two year calvers  to date. The early indications  are that two year 
olds at the heavier  weights  (525 kg) have a lower  culling  rate than either
40
of the other two groups. While this experiment  is still in progress  one 
could  indicate  that the pre-calving  target  weight  for heifers  should  be over 
500 kg calving  at two years and there is little advantage  to be gained  in 
delaying  calving  to three years of age if the heifers  are welt grown  as two 
year olds.
The effect  of level of concentrate  feeding  to dairy cows  
on a whole  farm system  basis
An experiment  to study the effect of pre- and post-calving  feeding 
levels  of concentrates  to dairy cows on a whole  farm system  basis is pre­
sently in progress  at the Agricultural  Institute  Field Station,  Solohead,  
Co. Tipperary.  There are four treatment  groups : herds A and B are 
stocked  at 1.17 acres per cow and herds  C and D at 0.96 acres per cow. 
Herds  A and C are fed 2.7 kg of concentrates  daily to all heifers  and first 
lactation  animals  in the prepartum  feeding  period. Post-calving  feeding  
levels for these groups  amount  to 5.5 kg of concentrates  daily to all ani­
mals from calving  until March  31st; and 2.7 kg thereafter  until the middle  
of May. All cows in herds B and D are fed 2.7 kg of concentrates  per 
day in the pre-calving  period  which  commences  in late November.  These  
two groups  of cows are fed 9 kg of concentrates  post-calving  until March  
31st and are then reduced  to 4.5 kg daily until the middle  of May. The 
first years results  (1978)  are presented  in Table  7.

The low meal groups  A and C were fed less than 500 kg of the con­
centrates  per cow and the high meal feeding  groups  B and D had an 
intake  of 860 kg and 750 kg of concentrates  respectively.  There  was no 
response  to increased  concentrate  feeding  levels at the low stocking  rate 
and there was an advantage  of 43 gallons  at the higher  stocking  rates.  
When one studies  the margin  over concentrates  there was no economic  
advantage  to feeding  the higher  levels  of feeding  at either  the low or high 
stocking  rates. This is the first year of this experiment  and therefore  the 
results  must be treated  with caution  but they do indicate  that care must  
be taken that excessive  amounts  of concentrates  are not fed to spring  
calving  cows resulting  in reduced  profitability  on the farm.
41
A similar  type of experiment  is in progress  at Moorepark  where  the 
concentrate  feeding  levels post-calving  over the entire  grazing  season  are 
being studied. The experiment  involves  four experimental  groups;  
Groups  A and B are stocked  at 1 cow per acre for the entire season 
and C and D are stocked  at 0.8 acres per cow. Groups  A and C are 
fed the lower levels of concentrates  approximately  500 kg per cow 
and Group  D and B are fed higher  concentrate  feeding  levels amount ­
ing to approximately  one tonne over the total lactations.  Groups  A 
and C are fed 7.3 kg of concentrates  per day post-calving  until the 
middle  of April when meal feeding  ceases with the exception  of 0.5 
kg of concentrates  to carry calcined  magnesite  until the end of May. 
No concentrates  were fed in the pre-calving  period,  with the excep ­
tion of the in-calf heifers. Groups B and D were fed 7.3 kg of 
concentrates  from calving  until the mid May when concentrate  feeding 
ceased. From early July until mid August  supplementary  feeding  at the 
rate of 3.2 kg a day was introduced  to groups  B and D as milk yields  
were declining  at over 2\% per week at this period.  Concentrates  were 
introduced  to both B and D in early September  at the rate of 3.2 kg of 
concentrates  per day until drying  off in mid-November.  This experiment  
then allows  a comparison  of more normal  management  groups,  A and C 
with groups  B and D where  higher  inputs  of concentrates  are fed to over­
come possible  feed deficits  during  the mid summer  period  and at the end 
of the grazing  season  where  herbage  availability  is declining.  The results  
for 1978 are presented  in Table  8,

The feeding  of an additional  500 kg of concentrates  resulted  in in­
creased  milk output  of over 100 gallons  for both stocking  rates, resulting  
in a response  of 1 kg of extra milk/kg  of concentrates  fed for both stock ­
ing rates. At present  concentrate  prices (£130) ton) this would not be 
economical.  However  if cheaper  feed ingredients  were available  there  
maybe some economic  justification  of higher levels. In Table 9 the 
responses  to the additional  meals over the different  periods  in the lacta ­
tion are shown. They indicate  clearly  that the continuation  of concen ­
trates from mid April to mid May gave a very poor response  in milk
42
yield. Better  responses  were obtained  to mid lactation  and late lactation  
feeding. But again the feeding  levels are not economically  justified  at 
concentrates  costing  between  £125 and £130 a ton.

This experiment  is also in its first year and it is not possible  to make  
definite  conclusions  on the feeding  of the additional  concentrates  particu ­
larly during  the mid and late lactation  periods. Half of the animals  in 
this experiment  were in their first lactation.
Cull cows
Data from a cull cow nutrition  experiment  at Moorepark  were used 
to demonstrate  the effect of level of nutrition  and body condition  on ani­
mal performance.  The object was to provide  information  on liveweight  
gains attainable  by cull cows and to determine  the economics  of over­
wintering  them. It was possible  during  the trial to examine  the effect of 
condition  and to relate  condition  changes  to liveweight.
Thirty-five  non-pregnant  cull cows from spring-calving  herds were 
assembled  and divided  on the basis of body condition  into high and low
43
score groups. These groups  were fed moderate  quality  silage and con­
centrates  as follows :
High score —ad libitum  silage.
High score —ad libitum  silage + 4 kg concentrates  daily.
Low score —ad libitum  silage.
Low score —ad libitum  silage + 4 kg concentrates  daily.
The trial lasted  92 days (7/11/77  to 9/2/78).  The concentrates  used con­
tained 16% crude protein;  silage intakes  were measured.  At the end of 
the trial the animals  were slaughtered  and six carcasses  from each group  
were divided  into muscle,  fat and bone components.  Performance  and 
carcass  disection  data are given in Tables  10 and 11, respectively.

All groups  increased  liveweight  during  the trial. Low score animals  
had a slightly  higher  rate of gain and consumed  an extra 0.4 tons of silage  
per animal.  There  was a good liveweight  response  to concentrate  feeding 
and rate of gain for these  cows was double  that of the silage  only groups. 
They consumed  less silage,  substituting  concentrates  for silage  at the rate 
of 1 kg concentrate  dry matter  for 0.4 kg silage dry matter. All groups  
improved  condition  and attained  good scores within the 92 days.
The low score groups  had lower killing-out  percentages;  they had 
lighter  carcasses  and csonsequently  a lower total yield of lean meat, fat 
and bone (Table  11).
Carcasses  from high score cows yielded  more lean meat but also gave 
much greater  yields of fat. This was especially  true for the concentrate  
fed group.

Modern  Milking
J. O’SHEA
Agricultural  Institute.  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
This review of modern  milking  requires  some definition  of the term  
“modern ”. A survey  of milking  practices  and equipment  in Ireland  was 
carried  out in 1960 and the results  of that survey  provided  the impetus  
for subsequent  milking  research. For the first time, research  reports  
named the makes of equipment.  Previously,  components  which were 
tested  in Research  Institutes  were identified  only by code numbers.
Table 1 shows the percentage  of the herds of different  sizes which 
were milked  in different  types of sheds  and the milking  rates of the herds. 
The outstanding  feature  of the data was the low number  of cows milked  
per man per hour.

Table 2 shows that a large percentage  of herds which had milking 
machines  were hand-milked  for part of the year. Ten per cent of the 
farmers  in the survey  had reverted  to hand-milking  from machine  milk ­
ing. Their  reasons  for this decision  are given in Table  3.

Present  situation
In 1979 it is not unusual  to find milkers  milking  70 cows per man per 
hour with a low incidence  of mechanical  faults, low levels of mastitis  
and producing  milk of high bacterialogical  quality. What has happened  
in the meantime  to cause  these changes?
After the 1960 survey studies  were commenced  on seven aspects  of 
milking  and milking  equipment;  the activities  were highly inter-related  
and are separated  only for convenience.  Similar  activities  have also been 
initiated  in some other Institutes  and milking  machine  manufacturers  
have also played a major role in the developments.  The inter-related  
studies  sought  to improve :
(1) Mechanical  efficiency  of milking  equipment.
(2) The adverse  effect of milking  machine  on infection.
(3) The standard  of installation  on farms.
(4) Maintenance  standards  of farms.
(5) Cleaning  of equipment  on farms.
(6) Milking  shed design.
(7) Number  of cows milked  per man per hour.
Performance  tests
To ensure  durable  and properly  functioning  milking  equipment,  milk ­
ing machines  and components  were tested under controlled  conditions  
and reports  were issued on their performaice.  This resulted  in a major  
improvement  in the quality  of components  on the market  (Table  4).
The improvement  in performance  indicated  by Table  4 underestimates  
the actual improvement  because  the standards  were being  raised  as years 
progressed.  Manufacturers  have generally  replaced  faulty components  
by satisfactory  components  from other manufacturers  until they had 
sufficiently  improved  their own components.  By way of comparison,  the

Machine  milking  and mastitis
Several experiments  in Moorepark  show the relationship between
irregular  vacuum fluctuations  and increased new infections  (Table 6).

Larger vacuum  pumps and pipes are now being installed  to improve  
vacuum  stability  and in response  to higher  reserves  vacuum  regulators  
have higher  capacities  and greater  sensitivity.
More recent  results  have shown  a relationship  between  liner slip and 
high new infection  rates (Table  7).

Manufacturers  are now trying  to improve  the stability  of the liners on 
cows ’ teats to reduce  the risk of infection  and to minimize  the disruption  
to milk incurred  by slips and fall offs.
Standard  of installation
Milking  machines  will be properly  installed  if farmers  request  that 
machines  are installed  to the Irish standard  IS 187 and get a written  
agreement  from the installer  that the machine  will be so installed.
Maintenance
Installers  generally  provide  a routine  maintenance  chart. Farmers  
should  follow  these instructions.  Technicians  have been trained  at Moore ­
park and more recently  in the Regional  Technical  Colleges  for testing  of 
milking  machines.  Every machine  should  be tested at least once a year 
by such a trained  technician  and his recommendations  should be fol­
lowed. There is evidence  that faults develop  on milking  machines  on 
many  farms  due to bad maintenance  (Table  8).

Cleaning  of milking  machines
Cleaning  problems  are minimal  in properly  installed  machines.  Simple 
cheap methods  of cleaning  have been developed  and have proven  very 
satisfactory.  Ease of cleaning  is monitored  during  performance  tests on 
components.
Milking  shed design
A booklet  on milking  shed design  is available  from The Agricultural  
Institute.  Milking  sheds should  have pipelines  rather  than recorder  jars. 
Herring  bone sheds should have two stalls per unit; sheds should  not 
generally  have feeders  or automatic  cluster  removers.  To record  yields 
milk meters can be used at 3 - 5 week intervals  for recording  yields.  
Double-up  parlours  (1 stall per unit) are only 60% as efficient  (cows  
milked  per unit per hour)  as two stall per unit plants.
Automatic  cluster  removers  were originally  designed  to prevent  in­
creased  mastitis  due to over-milking.  However,  there was no evidence 
available  to suggest  that over-milking  increased  mastitis.  The effect of 
cluster  removers  on herd milking  rates in a New Zealand  survey  was 
variable.  There  was an increase  in output  of up to 25% in milking  rate 
where  milkers  had corrected  wrong  routines  (spending  a lot of time trying  
to avoid over-milking).  At the other  end of the scale there was a depres ­
sion of up to 8% in output  due to using automatic  cluster  removers.
Throughput  of cows
The number  of cows milked  per man per hour will largely  be deter ­
mined by the number  of units handled  and this in turn will be deter ­
mined by the milking  shed design and properly  functioning  milking  
equipment  which  needs  no alterations  during  milking.  Machine  stripping  
can be omitted  with clusters  which have low strip yields and this will 
allow more units to be used.
Ancillary  equipment
As the duration  of machine  milking  is reduced,  the ancillary  activities  
such as yard-washing,  cleaning  of the milking  machine,  etc., are becoming 
a greater  percentage  of total time spent in the milking  shed. Conse ­
quently,  increased  attention  is being given at Moorepark  to ancillary  
equipment  such as different  types of in-parlour  feeding  automatic  cluster  
removers,  automatic  recorder  jar emptying,  yard-washing  and stand-by  
generators.
Electronics
In the past few years there has been a continuing  proliferation  of elec­
tronic equipment  for performing  various  functions  in milking  machines.  
Whilst  some of the future  improvements  in milking  equipment  will be by 
means  of electronic  devices,  not many advantages  have yet been proved.  
Manufacturers  should be required  to conduct  adequate  testing  of new 
equipment  or ideas before  they are sold to the consumer.  Farmers  should
53
be aware  of those features  which  are fashions  and those which  are neces ­
sities.
Summary
1. Performance  testing  ensures  that milking  equipment  available  to Irish 
farmers  is as good as is available  anywhere  in the world.
Machines  will be properly  installed  if specified  to IS 187.
Maintenance  on farms and a yearly  test by a technician  is essential. 
Milking  shed design  should  be simple  and proliferation  of equipment  
which  serves  no useful  purpose  should  be avoided.
Up to 70 cows per man per hour can be milked  in simple  milking 
sheds with good simple  milking  equipment.

This paper examines  a few possible  constraints  and questions  that arise 
from continued  growth  in milk output  in Ireland.  As the economic  condi ­
tions under  which  further growth  in output  might  take place  will be deter ­
mined mainly  by decisions  in Brussels,  a few comments  on the E.E.C.  
Commissions  proposals  are appropriate.
E.E.C.  Commission  Proposals
principle,  namely, that any measures  applied should be common  
measures  applying  throughout  the Community  so that Irish producers  are 
maintained  in a similar  competitive  position  with producers  elsewhere  in 
the Community.  This is the central  principle  of the Common  Agricul ­
tural Policy. The underlying  theory  is that under a system  of common  
measures  production  will tend to locate  itself in the regions  best suited  to 
it. The favourable  consequences  of this principle  for Irish milk produc ­
tion over the past six years are clear from Fig. 1. The relative  growth  
rates in milk supply  of the different  countries  strongly  suggest  that even
if Community  production  is no longer  to expand  into the future,  Irish  
production  can still expand  considerably,  so long as the principle  of 
common  measures  applying  throughout  the Community  is preserved.  But 
the introduction  of special  measures  to be applied  on a regional  or a sup­
plier basis, resulting  in regions  or suppliers  with a higher  output  growth  
paying  higher  penalties,  would be contrary  to the Common  Agricultural  
Policy,  and would  mean that a common  policy  for milk would  no longer  
exist.
Future  milk output  in Ireland
If milk output  continues  to increase,  will further  supplies  come from  
increased  yields or greater  cow numbers?  Study of past performance  
(Fig. 2) shows  that :
(i) In the decade  before  E.E.C.  membership  1963-1973,  creamery  milk 
output  increased  by nearly  67%; two thirds  of this increase  was due 
to increased  cow numbers  and one third was due to increased  yield.
(ii) Since E.E.C. membership  in 1973 creamery  output increased  by 
42%. However,  almost  two thirds of this increase  was due to in­
creased  yield,  with only one third due to greater  cow numbers  (Table
1). Yields  at present  are estimated  at 650 gals, per cow on average  
and have increased  by about 140 gals, on average  since E.E.C.  mem ­
bership  in 1973.

Milk yield
Let us consider  the factors which contributed  to increased  yields.  
Meal feeding  levels increased  from 4| cwts. per cow in 1973/74  to about  
9J cwts. per cow in 1978 and milk yields  increased  by 140 gals, per cow 
in this period  (Table  2). How much have meals  contributed  to increased  
yields? It depends  on making  an assumption  on the response  from in­
creased  meal feeding. Assuming  7 lbs. meals/gal.,  it is estimated  that 
about 78 gals, was produced  from extra meals. On this basis about  half 
of the 140 gal. increase  was therefore  due to other factors,  i.e., improved  
husbandry  and breeding,  better grassland  management,  more selective 
culling,  earlier  calving,  etc. The increase  in meal feeding  has been associ ­
ated with a more favourable  milk to meals  price ratio (Table  2).

In the future  it is unlikely  that the milk/meal  price ratio will become 
more favourable.  Hence,  further  yield increases  will depend  more on the 
other aspects  of dairy husbandry  as listed above.
Cow numbers
In discussing  growth  in cow numbers  it is more relevant  to consider  
total cows rather than the creamery  herd only. One of the surprising  
aspects  of E.E.C.  membership  to date is that total cow numbers  have 
remained  static. While creamery  cow numbers  have grown,  this growth  
has merely  replaced  the fall in beef cow numbers,  and from the latest  
figures  close to zero growth  will be true for 1979 also. In contrast,  there  
was a steady  growth  of about 3% per annum  in total cow numbers  in 
the decade  prior to E.E.C.  membership  (Fig. 3).
In explaining  the lack of growth  in total cow numbers  since 1973, the 
cattle crisis in 1973/74  is of foremost  consideration.  However,  there are 
other  factors  which  merit  discussion ;
1. the culling  rate, as a percentage  of the total cow herd;
2. the replacement  rate, as a percentage  of the total cow herd.
By definition  if the inflow  of heifers  or the replacement  rate is greater  
than the culling  rate, the herd increases  in sizes.
In general,  up to 1973 the culling  rate averaged  17% and the replace-  
rate was 20%. Hence,  growth  in the total cow herd was 3% per annum.  
The culling  rate fluctuates  much more widely  as can be seen from Fig. 4, 
between  the extremes  of 12-25%,  compared  with a very steady  replace ­
ment rate. The periods  of rapid  growth,  1963 - 1965 and 1970 - 1973 were 
associated  mainly  with a large drop in the culling  rate.

Since 1973 the culling  rate has moved  on average  to about 20%. the 
replacement  rate has remained  at 20% with the result  that there has been 
no growth  at all in the total herd. The points  arising  with regard  to future  
herd growth  are :
1. Has the culling  rate now moved  permanently  to a higher  level of 20% 
and will it possibly  move even higher  over the next few years due to 
the disease  eradication  programme?
2. If (1) is accepted  then there can be no herd growth  until the replace ­
ment rate moves  towards  25% of the herd, i.e. proportionately  more 
heifers  would  need to be directed  for breeding,  and fewer for beef.
Heifers  for breeding  or beef
The breakdown  of the utilisation  of heifers  as between  breeding  and 
beef in recent years provides  some interesting  insights.  From approxi ­
mately  2 million  cows over 800,000  maiden  heifers  are utilised  each year 
either  for breeding  or for beef production.  A breakdown  of heifer  utilisa ­
tion for the past five years shows very consistently  that about 45% of 
maiden  heifers  were utilised  for breeding  and about 55% for beef (Table  
3). The 45% for breeding  corresponds  to the 20% replacement  rate in 
the cow herd outlined  earlier. Now if the replacement  rate is to move  
towards  25% of the cow herd to provide  cow herd growth  in the future,  
then the breakdown  in the utilisation  of maiden  heifers  must be reversed.

For beef as % of total 54.2 56.8 54.2 54.1 53.6
' Perliminary  estimate
In Other  words.  55 -60%  of maiden  heifers  must be allocated  to breeding, 
leaving  40-45%  for beef production.  This change  in the utilisation  of 
heifers would firstly have important  implications  for breeding  policy.  
Secondly,  from an economic  view point,  schemes  for retaining  heifers  for 
breeding  instead  of selling  heifers  as beef animals  may be required,  par­
ticularly  in the case of the beef cow herd.
Increased  milk output —implications  for 
processing  sector
If creamery  milk supplies  continue  to increase,  what are the implica ­
tions for the processing  sector? The need for extra capacity  depends  
firstly on the seasonality  of milk supplies.  This subject  has been dis­
cussed  in detail at previous  conferences  (1). Hence,  only a summary  of 
the conclusions  is given here.

Irish manufacturing  milk supplies  are highly  seasonal,  unlike  the re­
mainder  of the E.E.C.  (Fig. 5). In butter  manufacture,  if production  in 
the peak month  is taken to be at 100% factory  capacity,  then overall 
capacity  utilisation  in the year in Ireland  is slightly  over 50%. In contrast  
o this, all other E.E.C.  countries  have a corresponding  capacity  utilisa ­
tion of the order  of 70 - 80% (Table  4).

u pattern  it to move in the long-term  towards  that of say
Holland  (Fig. 5) it would mean that present  processing  capacity  could 
hand e l,200 million  gallons  compared  with 853 million  gallons  actually  
handled  m 1978. This would represent  a major saving in investment  
costs at processing  level. Further  savings  at processing  level with a more 
even supply  pattern  would arise in labour  costs, fuel and power costs 
milk assembly  and in product  storage  and stock finance.
On the other hand, a Dutch  type milk supply  pattern  would involve  
a substantial  amount  of autumn  calving  and much  higher  milk production  
costs. Estimates  of the increased  milk production  costs are based here 
on a three year experiment  carried out by An Foras Taluntais  at 
allyraggett  a few years ago (2) in which specialised  autumn  calving 
and spring calving  herds were maintained,  i.e. present  day costs are

applied to the physical  performance  levels in the experiment.  From  
this work it is concluded  that autumn  calvers  would require  at present  
about lOp/gal.  extra over the whole  of the lactation  to compensate  for 
their increased  costs, mainly  due to the increased  meal feeding.  A Dutch  
type milk supply  pattern  would involve  about 45% autumn  calving  and 
55% spring  calving,  as derived  from the shape  of lactation  curves. Hence  
the 45% autumn  calving  at a production  cost increase  of about lOp/gal.  
is equivalent  to a 4.5p/gal.  milk production  cost increase  when spread  
over the total milk supply.
The total savings  at processing  level from a Dutch  type milk supply  
pattern  have been estimated  at about  2ip/gal.,  which  is very considerable  
in processing  cost terms,  but is only about  half of the increased  milk pro­
duction  cost. Hence,  it was concluded  that movement  to autumn  calving 
for a proportion  of the creamery  herd, to give a milk supply pattern  
similar  to Holland,  would not be advantageous  in overall  terms for the 
Irish creamery  industry.
This is not to suggest  that our calving  dates should  remain  static. The 
mean calving  date for the creamery  herd at present  is centred  on March,  
but has been moving  forward  steadily  over the past couple of years. 
Examination  of lactation  curves  for January  and April calvers,  based  on 
a sample  of 1,200 cows in Moorepark  herds,  shows  that lactation  for a 
January  calver  is 10 months  in duration  and is evenly  spread  through  the 
year, whereas  the lactation  for an April  calver  is about  8 months  in dura ­
tion and reaches  a peak in May/June,  the period  of the creameries  over­
all peak supply  (Fig. 6). Hence  movement  towards  earlier  calving  should 
result  in some improvement  in capacity  utilisation  at the processing  level.
All the above discussion  on seasonality  has been related  to storable  
products.  Some level of autumn  calving  would be desirable  in the 
development  of short life products,  which firstly require  more milk in 
winter  than is currently  available  and secondly,  give sufficient  returns  to 
economically  support  a level of autumn  calving  on farms.
Efficiency
The prospect  of limited price increases  in the immediate  future  
places more emphasis  on improvements  in efficiency  at all levels of the 
industry  as a means  of increasing  returns.
One important  area where efficiency  can still be improved  is milk 
assembly.  It is many years since bulk collection  was first discussed,  and 
now over 50% of milk in the country  is collected  in bulk. However,  the 
branch  creamery  system has remained  in many areas and is operating  
side by side with bulk collection.  The consequences  are ;
1. For bulk collection,  while many suppliers  still deliver to branch  
creameries,  bulk tankers  must travel long distances  to collect  a full 
tanker  load thus increasing  bulk collection  costs.
2. The remaining  branch  creamery  system  is even more costly  than the 
original,  as the throughput  at a branch  falls when some of the big 
suppliers  change to bulk collection,  thus raising branch creamery  
operating  costs.
63
FIGURE  6

Studies  of branch  creamery  operating  costs in a number  of co-ops  in 
recent  years show that for branches  with greater  than 500,000  gals, per 
annum,  a 2p/gal.  cost would  be the norm,  whereas  for branches  receiving 
less than 500,000  gals, per annum,  a 3p/gal.  cost would  be typical  (Fig. 7).

The present  position  in many  cases is that when some large suppliers  
leave branches  and transfer  to bulk, the branches  are changed  from the 
greater  than 500,000  gals, category  to the less than 500,000  gals, category.  
In other words,  the branch  creamery  system,  which is already  a very 
costly system  of assembly,  is becoming  even more costly. Both systems, 
branch  and bulk, are at their highest  cost when both are operating  side 
by side. It is surely  time that the final stage in implementing  bulk collec ­
tion was reached.

A Comparison  of the Economics  
of Milk Production  in 
Ireland  and Great  Britain
H. C. HUGHES
Extract  from the British  Milk Marketing  Board,  LCP Information  Unit
Report.
This extract  from the Report  compares  the results,  both physical  and 
financial,  for the two main samples  of farms in Ireland  and in England  
and Wales. It should  be remembered  that the results  are simple  averages  
and as such conceal  a wide range of individual  performance.
Physical  results
The physical  results  for the two samples  of farm are shown  in Table
1).

Stocking  rate (LSU per ha) 1.75 1.90
Nitrogen  use (kg per ha) 170 250
The farm size of the LCP sample  was 50 per cent greater  than that of 
the Irish sample. Land appeared  to be utilized  more intensively,  as 
measured  by a greater  rate of nitrogen  application  and a higher  stocking  
rate.
The management  of the herds as reflected  by milk yield and concen ­
trate input varied  widely,  the LCP farms obtaining  an extra 1,710 litres 
of milk per cow whilst  consuming  an additional  1,375 kg of concentrate.  
This pattern  reflected  a complete  dominance  of spring  calved  animals  in 
the Irish herds,  whilst  the LCP sample  comprised  animals  calving  at all
67
times  of the year. Further,  Ireland  has historically  suffered  low milk prices, 
encouraging  a low cost system,  while in the U.K. far more emphasis  has 
been placed  on yield per cow.
Financial  results
At the time of this study there was no difference  in the value of 
Irish and U.K. currency.  However  market  prices in the two countries  
differ; an outline of the cost of the major commodities  has been 
abstracted  from the two samples  (Table  2).

The most commonly  used measure  of dairy cow efficiency  is margin  
over concentrate,  made by combining  the physical  results  with the price 
levels indicated  above. This margin  for the Irish farms  was £292 per cow 
compared  with £295 in the case of the LCP sample.  These  figures  were  
surprisingly  similar  when one considers  the radically  different  approach  
to concentrate  feeding  coupled  with the difference  in milk output.
Incorporation  of the other costs and returns  attributable  to the dairy  
enterprise  enabled  construction  of the gross margin  shown in Table 3.

The greater  return  obtained  by the Irish for their calves  was balanced  
by a higher cost of replacement  heifers,  and their reluctance  to buy in 
roughage  feeds saved them £16 compared  with their LCP counterparts.  
The net result was an almost  identical  gross margin  per cow, but with 
the LCP herds being 75 per cent larger their total gross margin  was 
almost  £23,000  compared  with £13,000  for the Irish sample.
The whole farm gross margin  was obviously  influenced  by the mar­
gins made by other enterprises;  the Irish figures  in Table 4 being some ­
what higher than the LCP figure mainly  because  of the high transfer  
value of heifers  and the small amount  of concentrate  fed to them. This 
high transfer  value did at the same time reduce  the dairy herd margin.  
Coupling  the gross margins  with fixed costs enabled  a trading  account  
to be calculated  as shown  in Table  4.

The trading  account  shows that the Irish farms had substantially  
higher  profit  than the LCP sample.  This was despite  a smaller  herd size 
and a slightly  less favourable  milk price to concentrate  cost ratio. Thus,  
the Irish converted  a shortfall  of £7,500  in gross margin  to an advantage  
of over £4,000  in terms of profit. This disparity  was highlighted  by an 
examination  of the profit  achieved  per hectare.  A comparison  of each of 
the fixed cost items shows that the Irish are geared to a low input
69
approach,  as was seen earlier  in the case of concentrate.  This approach  
has been fostered  over the years when a relatively  low milk price was the 
order  of the day.
The period  between  1972 and 1978 has brought  a fourfold  increase  in 
milk price,  due to entry to the E.E.C.,  general  inflation,  and government  
action  over the green pound. The first two points  apply equally  to the 
UK but there remains  much greater  scope for price increase  by devalua ­
tion. Whilst  in the U.K.,  inflation  has put great pressure  on to the already  
high level of fixed costs,  in Ireland,  where  the costs  are historically  low, the 
effect  has been far less. Consequently  much  of the increased  milk revenue 
has immediately  been translated  into profit.
The cause of the large fixed costs in U.K. dairying  may well be that 
the LCP herds, in gearing  themselves  up to higher  yields, have at the 
same time adopted  systems  incurring  higher fixed costs, resulting  in 
decreased  rather  than increased  profits.
The low level of fixed costs recorded  on the Irish farms is surprising. 
Observation  of the equipment  on the farms  did however  explain  the posi­
tion. Very little fixed equipment  was present,  indicated  by the lower 
power,  machinery  and depreciation  charges.  Typically  the farmer  owned 
a second hand tractor  plus a fertiliser  distributor  and very little else. 
Major  tasks such as silage making  were often undertaken  by contractor.  
Whilst  most dairy cows were housed,  the buildings  used were simple  and 
intended  for only a relatively  short life. Further,  young  stock tended  to 
be outwintered  far more  than was the case in this country.  With almost  all 
land in Ireland  being owner-occupied  there was no rent to pay and with 
the majority  of land being in the family  for generations  there was little 
mortgage  commitment.  Further,  the low-key  nature of the businesses 
resulted  in very low bank borrowing.
The net result was that the fixed costs were one third of the level 
operating  in the LCP herds,  leading  to a profit of around  £12,500  com­
pared with the £8,000  obtained  by the LCP sample. However,  as was 
mentioned  above,  the Irish farms incurred  no rent and were less heavily 
committed  financially  than the LCP sample. Although  this is obviously 
important  when assessing  the returns  accruing  to the farmer  himself,  it is 
an unsatisfactory  measure  of business  efficiency.  A more  suitable  estimate  
can be made in terms of management  and investment  income  as shown 
in Table  5.
The difference  in profit was reduced  to some extent by the removal 
of the high interest  charges  prevailing  on LCP farms,  and imposition  of 
rental  charge  on the wholly  owner-occupied  Irish farms. Despite  this, the 
Irish sample  obtained  a management  and investment  income  30 per cent 
higher  than that prevailing  on the LCP farms. This was achieved  on a 
smaller  farm which was operating  a far simpler  system of dairy cow 
management.
Whilst  management  and investment  income  is commonly  used as a 
measure  of business  efficiency,  farmers  are more often concerned  with the 
cash position  of the business,  particularly  the availability  of cash to meet 
required  capital and private  expenditure.  A projection  of the trading

Cash surplus 3,171 -3,082
Note : (a) calculation  shown in Appendix  4
It can immediately  be seen from Table 6 that the difference  in profit  
was accentuated  in cash flow terms. The Irish farms  made a surplus  of 
over £3,000  whilst in contrast  their LCP counterparts  made a deficit  of 
£3,000.
This was partly due to the lower profit made by the LCP sample,  
aggravated  by a greater  proportion  of this profit being increase  in valua ­
71
tion, and also to the higher  commitments  of the LCP farms in terms of 
capital and private  expenditure.  Net capital investment  was markedly  
higher than that made by the Irish sample. This would appear  to be 
due to three reasons:  (1) the dairying  system  adopted  is far more inten ­
sive, thus requiring  greater  capital  investment  to maintain  itself; (2) the 
relatively  low profit levels perhaps  in certain  cases stimulate  investment  
to increase  the size of the business;  (3) increased  investment  is a means  
of reducing  the tax burden.
In Ireland,  however,  an extensive  dairying  system  is practiced  and, far­
mers paid no tax before 1974. Further,  the predominant  reaction  to low 
profits  in the past has been to tighten  the belt rather  than intensify.
However  whilst the LCP capital  expenditure  was higher  in absolute  
terms,  the figures  were almost  identical  on a per hectare  basis. This might  
be taken  as evidence  that the Irish, as a result  of current  profitability,  are 
now embarking  on a capital  improvement  programme.  Such expenditure  
will be further  encouraged  when the effects  of taxation  are realised.
The attitude  to capital  investment  was also reflected  in the approach  
to private  spending.  Despite  the large profit made in the current  year,  
private  spending  of £2,750  was small compared  with the £4,023  spent by 
LCP farmers.
Whilst  cash is important,  it may often be satisfactory  from a business 
point of view to increase  an overdraft  in particular,  or liabilities  in gene ­
ral, so long as asset values  are increasing  at a rate to compensate  both for 
this and inflation.  With the rapid escalation  in land values  over the past 
year, both samples  were able to achieve  this comfortably,  but a better  
assessment  of the business  position  of the two samples  can be made by 
comparing  the balance  sheets  at a single  point in time. (Table  7).
The most obvious  difference  was in land values,  mainly  due to the 
Irish being entirely  owner occupiers  whilst in the LCP sample  half of 
the land farmed  was rented.  Further,  land values  in Ireland  were higher  at 
around £4,500 per hectare compared  with an average  of £3,000 in 
England  and Wales. Otherwise  the most salient  point was the difference  
in liabilities,  the LCP sample  having  far higher levels of commitment,  
synonymous  with the more intensive  nature of the business  referred  to 
earlier. One aspect  of Irish policy with regard  to borrowing  seemed  to 
be a desire  to take as much money  as possible  in the form of a long-term 
loan. This contrasts  with the LCP sample  where  a much higher  propor-  
portion  of the borrowing  was taken  as bank overdraft.
Combining  the farm profitability,  as expressed  in terms of manage ­
ment and investment  income,  with the tenants  capital  taken from the 
balance  sheet showed  a return of 23 per cent for the Irish farms, as 
against  11 per cent for the LCP sample.  These  figures  confirm  the outline  
drawn  above  of a currently  more prosperous  Irish dairy industry.

Thus we have a picture  of Irish dairying  being on a solid financial  
base that has existed  for some time. However,  high profits  have now 
been added  to this foundation  and this is beginning  to reflect  in increased  
capital  investment  and private  drawings.  If current  levels of profit con­
tinue,  it seems  inevitable  that this change  will accelerate.

The Scope  for Irish Dairying  in an 
E.E.C.  Context
DR. T. O’DWYER
Milk Products  Division,  European  Economic  Communities,  Brussels.
The future of dairying  in Ire'and  is inevitably  and closely linked to 
policies  established  and pursued  at the European  level. Europe  now has 
a hand in virtually  every aspect  of dairying.  Yet perhaps  the strength  of 
those policies,  and sometimes  their weakness,  is the great bulk of econ ­
omic activity  which takes place within  the industry  with no direct  inter ­
ference from public bodies. The aspects of strength are primarily  
associated  with allowing  the economic  forces to take their normal  and 
natural  courses.  The weakness  is related  to the fact that so much public  
funds  are 'how involved  directly  and indirectly  in supporting  the industry  
that public bodies  at the European  level have a definite  obligation  in 
directing  the future  course  of the industry.  That obligation,  in particular,  
concerns  the growth  rates and future  size of the industry.  Recent  policy 
initiatives  by the Commission  are directed  primarily  towards  containing  
the overall size of the industry  within reasonable  limits and associate  
that industry  size with market  requirements.
Market  analysis
The market  situation  in the dairy sector has been analysed  in con­
siderable  depth in recent  years and especially  in COM (78) 430 final of 
the 25th September.  The salient  points in its conclusions  are that pro­
duction  continues  to increase  and demand  is at best static.
On the production  side, increases  in milk output  are almost  completely  
associated  with increases  in yield/cow.  Cow numbers  have been remark ­
ably stable  over the last decade  at about  25 million.  Yield  per cow which  
in the late sixties  would appear  to have been increasing  at about 1.7%  
per vear. increa.sed  by 2.5% in recent  years and in 1978 yield increased  
by 4%. It is Quite c'ear that yield is increasing  at an increasing  pace and 
no place has that been more true than in Ireland.  These yie’d increases  
are no doubt  resulting  from improved  breeding  but in particular  they are 
the resu't of better herd management  and improved  feeding,  especially  
using higher  levels of concentrate.  Even if the ratio of milk price/feed  
price doesn ’t improve  and perhaps  deteriorates  in the future,  yields  will 
continue  to increase  as more and more producers  get to appreciate  and 
understand  the economic  and technical  relationships  involved.
On the demand  side, the relationships  are much more complex  and 
segmented.  Basic consumer  habits differ widely  throughout  the Com ­
munity. The French consume  high levels of butter and cheese; the 
British  and Irish consume  a lot of butter and drink milk; the Italians  
drink wine, and their consumption  of cheese  is rather  low. Strong  pres­
77
sures exist, both naturally  and through  changing  life styles and through  
market  forces,  towards  reducing  butter  consumption.  Cream  and cheese  
consumption  continues  to increase.  Overall,  the Community  has been 
remarkably  successful  in maintaining  consumption  levels,  in milk equiv ­
alent terms,  in spite of the market  forces,  not improved  by the general  
sluggish  economies  throughout  Europe  and indeed  throughout  the world.
The end result,  in market  terms,  is one of ever increased  production  
and inilk deliveries  to dairies  and just about  static  demand.  The extent  of 
the inilk surplus  in the Community  was estimated  at 10% in 1976. It has 
continued  to increase  since. The extent  of surplus  perhaps  can be more 
strikin^y  expressed  in terms  of product.  Of the milk delivered  to dairies  
m the Community,  some 40% is converted  into butter  and skimmed  milk 
powder.  On the solids-non-fat  side, of the 2 million  tons of skimmed 
milk powder  produced,  some 90% is sold with levels  of support  varying  
between  45 and 90% of the intervention  price. When  skimmed  powder  is 
purchased  into intervention  at say 95 u.a./lOO  kg, it is stored  for say 2 
years,  costing  a further  24 u.a./ 100 kg and is then sold for incorporation  
into pig and poultry  rations  at about 15 u.a. /100 kg. It is surely  clear to 
most jieople  that this is not an economic  proposition  in the long term. 
Increasing  milk output is sometimes  rationalised  for Europe by the 
possibilities  which  exist for further  sales on the world market.
The Community  has already  a very large share of the world  market  in 
dairy produets.  The total world market  is very small compared  with 
world production.  In the developed  regions  of the world,  markets  are 
more than adequately  supplied  with domestic  production  and hence tend 
to be protected.  In the less developed  parts of the world,  the required  
infrastructure  does not exist, for handling  food aid from the Community.  
A considerable  backlog  of earlier  years ’ commitments  still remains  to 
be shipped.
In spite of that gloomy  picture  of the market  situation,  intervention  
stocks  of skimmed  milk powder  have been reduced  significantly  in recent 
years. While production  of powder  increased  by close to 200.000  tons 
in 19178, public  stocks  were reduced  by close to 300.000  tons. This was 
the direct result of the scope and efficiency  of the huge arsenal of 
measures  which the Commission  now has at its disposal  in this sector.  
However,  such an effort is at a large financial  cost hence we continue  
to strive  for more  effective  use of the funds  available.  From  a Communitv  
point of view intervention  tends to be very expensive  and it is much 
less costly if the skimmed  milk can be used directly  for say pig feed 
thus avoiding  the costs  involved  in drying,  financing  and storage.
Against  this background,  it is important  to understand  the dilemma  
racing  the Community  in this sector. It is not just sufficient  to focus on 
the financial  costs which run to some 42% of the Community  budget  in 
agriculture  and 28% of the overall  Community  budget. Some 20% of 
the producers  milk price is accounted  for by this budgetary  input Yet 
m the light of the foregoing  market  situation  and market  return  it surely 
justify  further  expanding  milk output  on a Community
78
d)Policy  objectives  and constraints
In the light of the above situation  the Commission  spelt out its 
objectives  and the guidelines  within  which policy should  be formulated  
over the next years. These  policy  guidelines  are as follows  :
a) to stop the increase  in milk production,
b) to avoid all measures  which run contrary  to this objective  and, in 
particular,  all aids to investment  given by public  funds  at the Com ­
munity  or national  level, which  favour  higher  production  and which  
are still given  at the level of the farm and at the level of the processing  
and marketing  enterprises,
c) to put the stress,  where possible,  on measures  which allow the level 
of consumption  to be maintained,  to increase  the outlets  for milk and 
to reduce  the milk production  potential,
to take the necessary  additional  measures  which  will take account  of 
the social situation  of small milk producers  working  in particularly  
difficult  conditions.
The Commission  also indicated  that these guidelines  would be im­
plemented  against  the background  of a number  of constraints  facing  the 
Community,  which effectively  limit the possibilities  for action. These  
restraints  have been identified  as follows  ;
a) The price relation  between  milk fat and protein  and vegetable  fat 
and vegetable  protein  which is influenced  by the differing  levels of 
external  protection.
The socio-economic  situation  of many small producers  farming  in 
regions  which  offer hardly  any alternative  possibilities.
The limited  outlets  available  on the world market,  either because  of 
restrictions  in certain  third countries  or because  of the high cost of 
additional  exports.
The continuation  of agri monetary  measures.
The general  economic  situation  in the Community  which  is character ­
ised by a high level of unemployment.b)

Commission  proposals
It was in the light of these guidelines  and constraints,  which  seem to 
be generally  understood  throughout  the Community,  that the Commission  
recently  made its proposals  to the Council.  The essential  elements  of 
these proposals  are :
1) No price increase
2) Co-responsibility
3) Continuation  of non-marketing  and conversion  premia
4) Temporary  suspension  of investment  aids
5) Aids to consumption.
1) Price: Price is an essential  element  of any policy aimed at 
reducing  the incentives  for any increase  in output. One may well argue  
about  the degree  of response  to price but there is little argument  about  
its direction.  Individual  producers  in the short term may well increase  
output  in order to maintain  income,  but globally  the response  must be 
of a classical  nature. Maintaining  price over a period is an effective  
decrease  in real terms. However,  production  technology  continues  to
79
advance.  Hence the impact of a non increase  in price is somewhat  
limited,  especially  when green rates are likely to ehange.  This in no way 
detracts  from the importance  of price in policy formulation  and in 
attempting  to bring a better  equilibrium  between  milk output  and con­
sumption  at a Community  level. Although  price is an essential  and 
necessary  element  of pwlicy it is not adequate  to deal with the current  
market  situation.
2) Coresponsibilify  levy : In recognizing  that price in itself is not 
adequate  as a means  of solving  the milk problem,  the Commission  was 
then faced with a series of options  which perhaps  could be summarized  
in the following  list :
a) Quota  arrangements —global  or individual
b) Reduction  of intervention  prices
c) Levy.
a) Quotas  : The Commission ’s view on this point is clearly  expressed 
in COM(78)  430, p. 26, paragraph  48 “Although  a system  of quotas  could 
have an immediate  effect, the Commission  is not in favour  of such a 
system. Such measures  would  be difficult  to reconcile  with the Commun ­
ity’s approach  based on free decision  and internal  trade; it would be 
almost  impossible  to construct  such a policy  without  some inequity  be­
tween different  producers  or regions  of the Community;  production  
quotas  tend to fossilize  the existing  structure;  quotas  would  be extremely  
difficult  to negotiate  and even more difficult  to change,  and consequently  
there is a risk that in due course there would be a return to surplus  
production ”. The substance  of that paragraph  cannot  be refuted  but it 
should  be c'early  recognized  that quotas  are a practical  approach  to the 
problem.  Since they are likely to breakdown  to a member  state division 
of entitlements  in one wav or another,  they are therefore  likely to be 
acceptable  to a number  of member  state administrations.  Hence those 
who fear the imp'ementation  of quotas should be the first to work  
towards  realistic  policy  alternatives.
b) Reduction  of intervention  prices  : Last vear the Commission  pro­
posed a temporary  suspension  of intervention  buying  for skimmed  milk 
powder  during  the winter  months.  It did so in the belief that prices  for 
the skim sector could be maintained  without  reliance  on intervention  
buying  throughout  the year. It did so also with a view to removing  one 
of the unnecessarily  high cost elements  in the milk sector even for a 
limited  period. Other reasons  were to encourage  people to use liquid 
skim directly  for feeding  and to introduce  at least some slight element  
of uncertainty  into the milk market. The proposal,  though  gaining  very 
considerable  support  in the Council,  was not accepted.
The Commission  thus examined  the related approach  of linking  
intervention  buying-in  prices to levels of milk output. As milk output  
increased,  buying-in  prices wou'd be reduced  by a related percentage.  
Such an approach  wou ’d be logical  economically  and would  have a direct  
impact both on producers  and consumers.  It is the tried and tested 
classical  approach  to output  problems  in an industry.  It has the further  
advantage  of being  simple  and straight  forward  to administer and control.
80
It would be the Commission ’s intention  to have had such an approach  
being  adopted  to protect  the ^cio-economic  weaker  sector  of the industry  
from a too drastic change in their situation.  Nevertheless,  the clear  
reaction  to that option  by the member  states  since the Commission  put it 
forward  as a possibility  last September  has been negative.  The interven ­
tion system,  rather  than perhaps  the objective  which lies behind  it, has 
become  sacrosanct.
c) Levy proposals : The option chosen by the Commission  in the 
light of the analysis  and consultations  undertaken  is that of a new ap­
proach  to the coreponsibility  levy. The essential  elements  are as follows ;
i) Level  would be associated  with the changes  in milk output  on a 
Community  basis. For every one per cent increase  in milk output,  
the levy would  be two per cent subject  to a continuing  minimum  of 
two per cent. Transitional  measures  would be established  for the 
period 1st June 1979 to 31st January  1980. The reference  periods  
would  remain  constant  thereafter.  The elements  are shown  in Table  
1.

1.2-79-31.5.791.2.80-31.5.80 1.10.80-31.1.81 2
After the transitional  period of eight months  ending  31.1.1980,  the 
reference  periods  wouM remain  fixed, the base periods  would be 
moved  forward  annually.  Milk deliveries  in the appropriate  base 
period  would  be compared  with the average  deliveries  in the approp ­
riate reference  period and the increase  in deliveries  in percentage  
terms would be multiplied  by the relevant  coefficient  to arrive at 
the level of levy, as a percent  of the target  price which  would  be ap­
plicable  for a further  four month  period. The ground  rules would  
thus be established  by the Council  and the system would have a 
considerable  degree  of automaticity  in the long term while providing  
for some variability  between  application  periods.
81
ii) With a view to protecting  the income  of small producers  with few 
other alternatives  to milk production,  a system  of exemptions  on the 
following  basis are provided  for :
— principal  occupation  is farming,
— under  55 years  of age or between  55 and 60 years  of age and enter  
into a commitment  to cease farming  at the age of 60 years,  con- 
sistant  with directive,  72/160,
— deliver  not more than 60,000  litres of milk per year,
— agricultural  holding  not more than 25 hectares,
— undertake  not to increase  their number  of dairy cows,
— not have more than one dairy cow per hectare.
This approach  can certainly  safeguard  the income  of small farmers  
while having  some deference  to the intensity  of farming  and thereby  
to the use of concentrates.  Commission  estimates  indicate  that when  
these exemptions  are combined  with those presently  existing  in the 
“hill” regions  and southern  Italy,  some 28 f)er cent of milk producers  
delivering  some 12 per cent of the milk would in fact be exempt.  
The corresponding  figures  in Ireland  are 18 per cent and 8 per cent,  
respectively.
iii) The corresponsibility  group would continue  to advise  the Commis ­
sion on the promotion,  advertising  and research  programmes  which  
should  be continued  at about  the present  level.
iv) Such an approach  to the levy is likely in the Commission ’s view to 
be effective  as a disincentive  to further  increases  in milk output  on 
a Community  basis. It is also equitable  between  producers  and 
makes  a great deal of economic  sense.
3) Non marketing  and conversion  premia  : Though  the results  todate  
have not been startling,  nevertheless,  this programme  has had a con­
siderable  degree of success. Up to the end of December  1978, some  
700,000  cows have been accounted  for which reduces  the potential  for 
milk output  by fairly  close to 3%. The response  has been very different  
between  member  states and even between  regions  within  member  states.  
In general,  most people  are favourable  towards  it. Farm leaders  and 
national  administratons  who strongly  favour  its continuity  and enlarge ­
ment are particularly  impressed  with the need for its acceptance,  applica ­
tion and encouragement  in member  states other than their own. This 
type of programme  can be very effective  if the premiums  are high 
enough;  but also if unemployment  benefits  were high enough  nobody  
would  need to work. Where  would  the money  come from ? However,  it 
is proposed  to continue  it for another  year and to the extent that the 
total programme  proposed  by the Commission  is adopted  by the Council,  
it is likely to become  attractive  to a larger  group  of producers  who have 
some other uses for their available  resources.
4) Temporary  suspension  of investment  aids : It appears  totally  
illogical  to continue  to use Community  and national  public  funds  at farm  
and factory  level to further  enlarge  the size of the industry  at a time when 
the central  objective  of any reasonable  policy  in this sector  inevitably  has 
to be to limit its future  growth  to a minimum.  Hence  the Commission ’s 
proposal  for suspension  of aids to investment  at all levels  of the industry,
82
subject  to some exceptions  in very particular  cases. The proposal  is not, 
as has been suggested,  that all investment  should cease but that this 
investment  should  not be assisted  from public  funds. It seems  even more  
illogical  that the member  states (who shall be nameless  !) who claim to 
have a comparative  advantage  in milk production  and who claim to 
produce  milk more efficiently  than anybody  else, should  be foremost  in 
their  opposition  to this proposal.  It would  appear  to be difficult  to defend  
aids to investment  at the manufacturing  level in circumstances  when  
most of the aids heretofore  granted  at that level have yet to be taken up. 
There is little doubt but that all investment  aids in recent  years in this 
sector have led either directly  or indirectly  to further  increases  in milk 
output.
5) Aids to consumption : It has already  been indicated  that adequate  
measures  are now available  to meet the requirements  as they arise in the 
skim sector. However  the butter  sector  is the cause  of increasing  concern  
as stocks rise steadily. In spite of high export refunds  for butter and 
butter  oil, sales at reduced  prices  for pastry  and ice cream  manufacture,  
sales to armies  and non-profit  making  institutions,  for the manufacture  of 
butter concentrate  and reduced  prices for butter for people on social  
assistance,  some further  measures  are clearly  necessary.  Short  term sales 
at reduced  prices,  the so-called  Christmas  butter schemes,  were reason ­
ably successful  in 1977 and 1978—but much more so in the former  than 
the latter. In view of this, the Commission  is proposing  an enlarged  
general  butter subsidy  scheme. Whereas  under present  legislation,  if 
member  states grant a butter  subsidy  of 56 u.a./ 100 kg, the Community  
contribution  is 23 u.a. On the basis of the Commission ’s proposal,  at 
the level of 56 u.a., the Community  contribution  would  be 42 u.a. /100 kg. 
Such a scheme  should  be attractive  to a number  of member  states  besides 
those already  implementing  the butter  subsidy  scheme.
Implications  for Irish dairying
The above paragraphs  outline  the environment  within  which,  on the 
basis of the Commission ’s proposals,  the Irish dairy industry  will be 
operating  in the future. It is an environment  where prices  in real terms  
shall decrease  somewhat  and where aids to further  investment  shall be 
considerably  limited. It is also a situation  where a levy on milk, asso­
ciated  with the level of changes  in milk output  at the Community  level, 
will become  an integral  part of Community  policy. The level of the levy 
should  be such as to provide  a real disincentive  to further  increases  in 
global milk output. Small farmers,  with no other alternatives,  will find 
their income  situation  adequately  protected.  Milk will continue  to be a 
profitable  business  at all levels for those operating  efficiently.  Total out­
put will to a continuing  degree have to be associated  with market  
requirements.  Producers  under  the above proposals  can plan on a sound 
and constructive  policy  being implemented  well into the future  providing  
adequate  scope for enterprise  and technical  and managerial  ability. The 
policy  provides  for equity  between  producers  right throughout  the Com ­
munity  under their varying  circumstances  and thus taking  into account  
their long-term  interests.

EIGHTH  EDWARD  RICHARDS-ORPEN  MEMORIAL  LECTURE
Some  Aspects  of Recent  Research  
in Dairying
F. J. GORDON*
Ai’riciillural  Research  Institute.  Hillshorough,  N. Ireland.
Introduction
I would like to sincerely  thank the Trustees  of the Edward  Richards-  
Orpen Memorial  Trust for inviting  me to present  this Eighth  Memorial  
Lecture.  When  I received  the invitation  I recognised  that it would  not be 
an easy task to pre.sent  a lecture  fitting to the memory  of such a person  
as Mr. Richards-Orpen  about  whom  I have read so many  tributes.  Never ­
theless  I felt that I must accept  the invitation  if the dairy industry  is to 
benefit  from the total research  effort which is being expended  under the 
the favourable  grass-growing  conditions  which  we enjoy throughout  Ire­
land. Indeed  it is because  of this importance  of grass in our ruminant  
based systems  that so much of the nutritional  research  work carried  out 
in other countries,  such as Great Britain,  is of relatively  little direct  value  
in our environment.
The tremendous  potential  for grass  growth,  and hence  animal  produc ­
tion, from grassland  in Ireland  has been recognised  for many years but, 
even yet, I do not think that this is fully appreciated  let alone exploited.  
For example,  the yields of grass dry matter  recorded  in variety  testing  
work at Crossnacreevy  near Belfast  is 60 per cent greater  than the average  
of the other sites for similar  trials throughout  the United  Kingdom  (1).
When research  in dairying  was initiated  at Hillsborough  ten years 
ago it was considered  that the major  effort must be devoted  to exploiting  
this potential  of grass or grass products.  During  this period  a number  of 
different  aspects  have been investigated,  but I intend  to speak  only on the 
following  three areas :
1. Development  of a spring-calving  system.
2. Silage  quality.
3. Protein  nutrition  on indoor  diets.
While the research  work carried  out under 1 above  has been concerned  
solely  with a specific  system,  that under  2 and 3 has been of a more gene ­
ral nature and has implications  for dairy management  irrespective  of 
season  of calving.
1. Development  of a spring  calving  system
In any grass-growing  environment  in which  efficient  milk production  
is required  it is obvious  that a system  which  attempts  to match  the chang ­
ing requirements  of the dairy cow throughout  it’s lactation  to the quantity

and quality  of the feed available  must be of major importance.  This is 
the basis of the spring-calving  system  and for this reason  a considerable  
part of our research  programme  at Hillsborough  has been devoted  to 
developing  such a system. However,  as all those involved  in research  are 
aware,  a research  programme  aimed  at establishing  optimum  systems  for 
any type of animal  production  is extremely  difficult.  This difficulty  arises 
not only because  of the problems  brought  about by the large scale and 
long-term  nature  of the trials, but also because  some basic assumptions  
must be made when establishing  the ‘bare framework ’ of the system  on 
which to build the details. In the present  context  the basis framework  
consisted  of making  broad  decisions  on the calving  pattern  to be adopted,  
the time at which animals  are likely to be able to go to pasture  in the 
spring  and the type of conserved  grass to be used for winter  feed. An 
example  of the implications  of these decisions  is demonstrated  by the fact 
that if a research  programme  was superimposed  on a system  based on 
hay as against  silage for the winter  feed this would affect the answers  
which  would  be obtained  to questions  such as what is the optimum  level 
of nitrogen  fertiliser  and optimum  concentrate  inputs. We assumed  that 
the basic  system  would  have the following  framework :
I. Due to ground  conditions  prevailing  in the North  of Ireland  animals  
will require  to be maintained  indoors  for a minimum  period  of five 
months  and will not be at pasture  until early or mid-April.
Grass  conserved  as silage  should  be the basal winter  diet as it allows  a 
greater  exploitation  of the growth  potential  of grass.
Calving  should  commence  on January  1st and be as compact  as pos­
sible thereafter.
The decision  to calve  early,  relative  to the onset of the grazing  period,  
was based primarily  on the fact that information  produced  by Wood  (2) 
from a survey  of milk yield data from the Milk Marketing  Board for 
England  and Wales  demonstrated  that there was a consistent  decline  in 
lactation  yield with progressively  later calving  after January.  This was 
later confirmed  in an analysis  of data from Hillsborough  (3) which 
showed  a mean decline  in lactation  yield of 220 kg for each month ’s 
delay in calving  between  January  1st and April 1st. A relatively  similar  
decline  of 180 kg/month  has been reported  by Cunningham  (4).
Commencing  with this basic system,  revolving  around  block-calving  
starting  on January  1st, giving  grass silage as the basal diet during  the 
winter period and grazing  pasture  from early April until grass growth  
declines  or land becomes  too wet for grazing  in the autmn,  the object  has 
been to establish  the optimum  inputs  of some of the major  variables  in 
the system. These  include  the amount  of nitrogen  fertiliser  which  should  
be applied  to the grass,  the stocking  rate to be used and the quantity  of 
concentrate  required  to supplement  the basal diets of silage  or grass.2.

Nitrogen  for grazed  pasture
The optimum  level of any input is dictated  by the cost of that input  
relative  to the value of the product  produced,  coupled  with the response 
relationship  between  the input and the product  output. In the case of 
fertiliser  nitrogen  this response  relationship  has been the subject  of more
86
discussion  and debate  over the past 20 years than probably  any other  
input. The response  to nitrogen  has been measured  in terms  of grass dry 
matter  output  in many  grass  cutting  experiments,  but a smaller  number  of 
experiments  have been designed  to assess  the response  in terms  of animal  
output  either as milk or beef. Currently  our thinking  is based on the 
results  from a three year trial, carried  out by my former  colleague  Roger  
Marsh  at Hillsborough  (5) during  the early 1970 ’s, in which  he character ­
ised the relationship  between  nitrogen  input and beef output. This rela­
tionship  indicated  that a substantial  response  in animal product  was 
obtained  up to about 400 kg nitrogen  per hectare. In earlier  work (6) 
carried  out with dairy cows, again over a three year period,  grazed  on 
pasture  receiving  400 and 700 kg nitrogen  per hectare  a marginal  increase  
of only 7 per cent in milk output  at the higher  nitrogen  level was detected.  
The combination  of these two studies  led us to the conclusion  that the 
optimum  nitrogen  input for grazing  under intensive  stocking  conditions  
was likely to be of the order of 400-450 /kg per hectare  and this, there ­
fore, was the level adopted  in the system.  It is recognised,  however,  that 
this recommendation  is not in line with recommendations  in the Republic  
of Ireland  and this is a source  of some concern.  For example  McFeely,  
Butler  and Gleeson  (7) have recommended  a maximum  nitrogen  input of 
250 kg per hectare  with intensive  dairying,  while Collins,  Drennan  and 
Flynn (8) have stated that it is difficult  to recommend  levels of nitrogen  
above 120 kg per hectare  for beef cattle. This disparity  in recommenda ­
tions cannot  be taken lightly  and because  of its importance  we hope in 
the present  year to re-examine  the response  to nitrogen  through  the dairy  
cow.
Nitrogen  for conserved  grass
As ground  conditions  in Northern  Ireland  require  that dairy cows be 
housed  for a period  ranging  from 5 - 6 months  each year there is a very 
large requirement  for conserved  forage. In the practical  context  this may 
best be achieved  through  the use of specialised  conservation  area man­
aged separately  from the grazing  area rather than trying to integrate  
conservation  and grazing  into a single system. With this approach  the 
optimum  nitrogen  input for conservation  can be determined  directly  from 
cutting  trials and an example  of the results  obtained  from one such trial 
carried  out at Hillsborough  (9) is given in Table 1.

400 12570
600 14290
800 14730
87
From results  of this type it has been concluded  that the response  of cut 
herbage  to nitrogen  is considerable,  even to levels above 400 kg per 
hectare,  and that this sort of level can be readily  adopted  for conserva ­
tion.
Stocking  rate at pasture
The optimum  stocking  rate in any dairying  system  will obviously  be a 
function  of the quantity  of grass which  can be produced  per hectare  and 
the nutritional  requirements  of the animals  utilising  this grass. With the 
levels  of nitrogen  used at Hillsborough  relatively  high yields  of grass dry 
matter  are achieved  with amounts  of around 11,000  kg dry matter  per 
hectare  consumed  by cows being regularly  recorded  (10). If a metabol-  
isible energy  value for grass of 11.5 MJ per kg dry matter  is assumed,  
the level of grass energy  output  per hectare  should  be capable  of sup­
porting  around  5.0 cows producing  an average  daily milk yield over the 
the grazing  period  of 15 kg, while  at the same time gaining  in bodyweight  
at the rate of 0.4 kg per day (using  the ME requirements  of Friesian  
cows as given by MAFF,  DAFS  and DANI)  (11). In the first two years 
of our stocking  rate experiments  rates of 6.4 and 4.9 cows per hectare  
over the grazing  season  (3.2 and 2.7 cows per hectare  including  the con­
servation  area) were examined  (12). The results  obtained  from these are 
given under  Experiment  1 in Table  2.

Milk output/cow  at pasture  (kg) 2963 3181
Overall  stocking  rate—including  conservation  (cows/ha) 3.0 2.5
In summary  it was found that, while  the output  of milk produced  per 
hectare  of grazing  area was increased  by 17 per cent through  the use of 
the higher  stocking  rate, performance  per animal  was reduced  by about  
11 per cent. From these results  it was concluded  that, while the higher  
stocking  resulted  in a very high milk output  of over 16,500  kg per hectare,  
the depression  in performance  per cow at 276 kg was too great  to be used 
in the practical  context. However  when the lactation  curves of both 
groups  were compared,  it was apparent  that the use of a high stocking 
rate in early season  did not reduce  milk output  during  that period and
88
that the reduction  in milk yield per animal  only occurred  from late June  
onwards.  This led to the approach  of maintaining  high stocking  rates of 
about  6.4 cows per hectare  during  the early  part of the grazing  season  and 
reducing  this in steps as the rate of grass growth  declined  by introducing  
additional  land from the conservation  area to finish at around  4.9 cows  
per hectare  by late September.  By this approach  a high output  of milk 
per hectare  can be achieved  without  depressing  the performance  of the 
individual  animal  too severely.  An example  of the results  obtained  using  
this method  is given  in Table  2 (Experiment  2), in which  the mean  stock ­
ing rate of 5.6 cows per hectare  was obtained  by the systein  outlined  of 
starting  the grazing  season  at 6.4 cows per hectare  and finishing  at 4.9 
cows per hectare  (10). These results  indicate  that a very high level of 
milk output  per hectare  at 16,985  kg could  be produced  with a depression  
in individual  animal  yield of about  7 per cent.
While  the approach  outlined  above  goes some way towards  producing  
high outputs  of milk per hectare  without  reducing  yield per cow too 
severely,  it must be recognised  that the conflict  between  high output  per 
hectare  and high output  per cow remains  one of the major  problems  in 
grass utilisation  and the problem  is likely  to increase  as we steadily  move 
towards  higher  yielding  cows.
There  have been various  attempts  to solve this problem  by manipula ­
tion of the grazing  system. Examples  of this have been the adoption  of 
systems  which  allowed  the higher-yielding  cows to selectively  graze  ahead  
of lower producers  and the use of systems  which  alternated  grazing  and 
cutting.  Neither  of these approaches  seem to offer much  hope  of success.  
An experiment  has also just been completed  at Hillsborough  investigat ­
ing another  approach  (10). To achieve  high outputs  of milk per hectare  
requires  firstly good grass growth  and, secondly,  that grass is grazed  
fairly severely  to ensure  that most of the grass is utilised.  However  it is 
known  that grazing  herbage  severely  reduces  grass intake  per cow and 
hence milk output  per cow. It was felt, therefore,  that if a system  was 
used which  only severely  defoliated  the sward  at intervals  rather  than at 
each grazing  the depression  in yield per cow might be lessened.  In the 
exfjeriment  a conventional  system,  which  involved  a severe  defoliation  at 
each grazing,  was compared  with two systems  in which the sward was 
severely  defoliated  at either alternate  or every third grazing.  All three  
systems  were maintained  at equal stocking  rates. The preliminary  results  
are given in Table 3.
These results show no advantage  for either of the two experimental  
grazing  systems.  In 1977, when the stocking  rate was sufficiently  high 
to depress  yield per animal  by 10 per cent on the conventional  system,  
there appeared  to be some advantage  from the system  where  severe  de­
foliation  was carried  out at every third grazing.  A similar  effect was not 
obtained  in 1978 but this may have been due to good grass  growth  in that 
year resulting  in a low depression  in yield per cow at the higher  stocking  
rate of only 4 per cent. It seems unlikely,  therefore,  that this approach  
of alternating  lax and severe  grazing  will offer any scope  for improvement  
although  I feel that the general  concept  still merits  some research  consi ­
deration.

Level  of concentrate  supplementation  during  the indoor  period
Where the winter  diet of the spring-calving  cow is to be based on 
silage the nutrient  requirement  of the fresh calved animal  will exceed 
those that can be supplied  from silage alone and the deficiency  has to be 
remedied  by the use of supplementary  concentrates.  However  the ques ­
tion of how much concentrate  to feed during  this period  is continually  a 
rnatter  for debate.  It could  be argued  that the quantity  can be determined  
simply  from a calculation  based on the theoretical  requirements  of the 
animal  and a knowledge  of the nutritive  value of the feeds. While such 
an approach  may satisfy  the nutritionist  it may not necessarily  provide  
the correct  answer  in terms of economics.  This can only be determined  
by firstly establishing  the way in which the animal  will respond  to a 
change  in concentrate  input and from this deciding  the optimum  econo ­
mic level of supplementation.  A series of three experiments  has been 
carried  out at Hillsborough  in order to provide  data on the response  in 
milk output  to a change  in concentrate  input. In all of these studies 
cows have had ad libitum  access  to medium-good  quality  grass silage  with 
“D”-values  of the order of 65 - 67 and metabolisable  energy  contents  of 
about 10.0 MJ per kg dry matter. No concentrates  were given prior to 
calving  and in each year the animals  have calved  from early January  until 
early March,  with a mean calving  date of between  January  18-25th  in 
any year. In each year the animals  went to pasture  during  early-mid  
April.
In Experiment  1 three levels of concentrate  of 3.8, 5.5 and 7.2 kg per 
day were used from calving until going to pasture in each of two 
years (13). At pasture  the cows were grazed  at a mean stocking  rate of
5.5 cows per hectare  without  any concentrate  supplementation  other than
90
for 7 - 10 days after turn out in the spring. The results  obtained  are given 
in Table  4.

Liveweight  at end of lactation  (kg) 606 606
Increasing  the concentrate  input not only increased  milk yield indoors  
but also resulted  in substantially  more milk being  produced  at grass. The 
overall  effect was therefore  that the higher  concentrate  input provided  
the greatest  economic  return.
In Experiment  2 a higher  level of supplementation  of 9.5 kg per day 
was compared  with that of 7 kg per day which  had been found  to be best 
in the previous  trial (12). Again  the experiment  was carried  out over a 
two year period  and the animals  were grazed  at a mean stocking  rate of 
5.7 cows per hectare.  The results  in Table  4 show that, while the higher  
level of concentrate  feeding  indoors  increased  the quantity  of milk pro­
duced during  the indoor  period,  it did not improve  total lactation  yield  
because  the animals  on the higher level of supplementation  tended  to 
produce  less at pasture.  The result  was obtained  even though  theoretical  
calculations  of nutrient  requirements  indicated  that the higher  level of 
supplementation  was the more nutritionally  correct  diet.
Because  of the scepticism  for these results  displayed  by those con­
cerned  with high concentrate  inputs  a further  experiment  was undertaken  
to examine  further  high concentrate  inputs  (14). In this trial (Experiment

3) 7.2 kg per day of concentrate  was compared  with a higher  input than 
that used previously  at 10.5 kg per day. The results  obtained  are given 
in Table 4. Again the higher concentrate  input increased  milk output  
indoors,  but reduced  the subsequent  performance  at pasture  with the 
net effect being  that total lactation  yield was not improved.
The conclusion  from this series of experiments  must be that when  
good quality  silage,  given ad libitum,  forms the basal diet the optimum  
level of concentrate  supplementation  is around  7.2 kg per day. Higher  
levels  than this cannot  be justified  even with animals  giving  5,100  kg milk 
per lactation,  which is the mean yield of all animals  used over the five 
year experimental  programme.
Pattern  of concentrate  supplementation
The research  work described  previously  had clearly  established  the 
optimum  level of concentrates.  However  the question  arises  as to whether  
concentrates  should  be allocated  at the same level per day from calving  
until going to pasture  or whether  it would be better to allocate  more  
concentrates  immediately  post-calving  in order to stimulate  production  
at the commencement  of lactation. For example  Broster  and his col­
leagues  at the National  Institute  for Research  in Dairying  (15) have sug­
gested that improved  feeding  during  the first four weeks after calving  
has a substantial  beneficial  effect  on production  throughout  the remainder  
of the lactation. A two year experiment  was therefore  undertaken  to 
compare  a flat-rate  feeding  system  in which each animal  received  the 
same level of concentrates  per day from calving  until going to pasture  
with a high/low  system  in which much higher  amounts  of concentrates  
were given  during  the first four weeks  after calving  (14). All animals  had 
access  to the same silage  and the total input of concentrates  was similar.  
The results  are given in Table  5.
Table 5
Effect  of pattern  of concentrate  allocation  after calving
Concentrate  allocation  system Flat rate High/low
Total concentrate  input (kg) 412 402
Milk yield indoors  (kg) 1851 1848
Milk yield at pasture  (kg) 3170 3048
Total lactation  yield (kg) 5021 4893
These  results  showed  that adopting  a high/low  system  had no beneficial 
effect on either  the amount  of milk produced  indoors  or during  the total 
lactation.  This, therefore,  eliminates  the need to use high concentrate  
inputs  during  the post-calving  period  when  digestive  upsets  are frequently  
encountered.
In this comparison  all animals  within each treatment  received  the 
same amount  of concentrates  irrespective  of the yield of the individual
93
cow. In a further  experiment  a flat-rate  feeding  system  in which  all ani­
mals received  the same quantity  of concentrates  was compared  with a 
high/low  system in which the concentrate  input for each animal  was 
related  to its milk yield with high yielding  animals  receiving  more and 
low yielders  less concentrate  (16). The effect on milk yield is shown  in 
Table  6.

Milk yield indoors  (kg) 1946 1954
Mean  yield after 10 wks. at pasture  (kg/d) 18.4 18.5
There was no effect of system  of allocation  on milk output  during  the 
indoor  period  and, while the experiment  did not embrace  a full lactation,  
the performance  during  the first ten weeks  at pasture  did not show any 
difference  in residual  effects.
The results of this and the previous  experiment  show that with a 
spring  calving  system  a uniform  daily feed allowance,  irrespective  of stage  
of lactation  and milk yield potential  of the individual  cow, will produce  
equivalent  results  compared  with more complicated  systems  which  either  
aim to achieve  high peak yields  or allocate  feed according  to milk yield.
Concentrate  supplementation  at pasture
The use of concentrates  as a supplement  for dairy cows at pasture  has 
been a feature  of the U.K. dairy industry  for many years. This practice  
has been founded  on a continual  attempt  by the dairy farmer  to provide  
for the nutritional  requirements  of the lactating  animal.  However  it must 
be appreciated  that the short term nutritional  requirements  of the animal  
are of much less importance  than is the economic  response  to any addi­
tional feed given,  provided  the long term nutrition  and health is not im­
paired. Leaver,  Campling  and Holmes  (17) reviewed  the results from 
experiments  in which  the response  in milk yield to concentrates  given at 
grass  had been assessed  and, in general,  the results  indicated  that between 
2 to 5 kg concentrates  were required  to produce  an extra 1 kg milk. How ­
ever most of the experiments  were conducted  with cows which  were not 
in early lactation  and high yielding  with the result that critics  have sug­
gested that the findings  may not be applicable  to the higher-yielding,  
spring-calving  cow. For this reason  an experiment  was carried  out at 
Hillsborough  to examine  the response  from cows calving  during  March  
and April (18). These cows were producing  on average  28 kg milk per 
day prior to going  to pasture  and were grazed  together  as a single  group  
at a stocking  rate of 5.5 cows per hectare  throughout  the experiment  
which  lasted for 14 weeks. The cows were given three levels of cereal-  
based supplement  of 0.45, 2.25 and 4.05 kg per day. There  was a good
94
supply  of grass available  throujghout  the experiment.  The mean perfor ­
mance  over the period  is given in Table  7.

These results  show that even with high-yielding,  spring-calving  cows  
the response  to additional  concentrates  when ample  grass is available  is 
extremely  low. It has now been shown  conclusively  that the major  reason  
for this small response  to supplements  at grass is due to the supplement  
depressing  the intake of herbage  by the aiiimal  with the net result that 
the total nutrient  intake  is only marginally  increased.  It has been argued  
that, while cereals  result in a considerable  depression  in herbage  intake,  
the effect could be reduced  by using supplements  which are more com­
plementary  to the digestion  of forages  in the rumen. Dried  grass was felt 
to be a possibility  and some work has been carried  out at Hillsborough  
to examine  if the inclusion  of this forage  in the supplement  mix, or giving  
a sole supplement  of dried grass, would improve  performance  (19). In 
essence  the results  have shown  that neither  the use of dried grass on its 
own nor it’s inclusion  as a proportion  of the supplment  has improved  the 
response  at pasture.
The above  results  demonstrated  clearly  that when  there  was a reason ­
able supply  of grass, concentrate  supplementation,  even to high-yielding  
animals,  was of no economic  benefit.  However  there are occasions  when  
grass is in short supply  and it seems  likely  that in such circumstances  the 
response  to supplementation  would  be greater.  Such circumstances  arose  
during  the very dry summer  period  in 1976 when  the rate of grass  growth  
was extremely  low. During  this period  of grass shortage  a trial was set 
up to assess  the effect  of providing  supplementary  feed (20). Three  treat ­
ments were applied  to a group of cows grazing  as a single group at a 
stocking  rate of approximately  4.5 cows per hectare.  In one treatment  no 
supplement  was provided  while in the other  two treatrrients  4 kg per day 
of a supplement  containing  9 or 21 per cent crude  protein  was given. The 
results  obtained  are given in Table  8.

The milk yield response  to both supplements  was considerably  greater  
than those  normally  reported  due to the very limited  supply  of grass avail ­
able. However  even in such circumstances  the response  of 0.6 and 0.8 
kg milk per kg of concentrates  for the high and low protein  supplements  
respectively  did not increase  the profitability  of milk production.  It may, 
however,  be worth  noting  that the response  tended  to be greater  with the 
higher  protein  supplement  and this is an area which  could merit research  
work if for any reason in the future supplements  should be used at 
pasture.
Performance  of spring-calving  system
The foregoing  discussion  has been concerned  with an examination  of 
the individual  components  of the spring-calving  system. However  
throughout  this experimental  programme  attempts  have been made to 
incorporate  each aspect into an overall  system  of management  for the 
existing  herd. The system  now adopted  therefore  incorporates  these re­
search  findings.  Basically  this implies  a block-calving  programme  com­
mencing  at the beginning  of January  and aiming  for completion  by early  
March. No concentrates  are given prior to calving  and all animals  are 
given a uniform  concentrate  input of 7.2 kg per day, irrespective  of yield  
potential  or lactation  number,  from calving  until going  to pasture.  Graz ­
ing commences  during  early to mid-April  at a stocking  rate of 6.4 cows  
per hectare  during  the early season  decreasing  in steps to reach 4.9 cows  
per hectare  by early August  and with about 430 kg N per hectare  being  
applied  over the grazing  season. No concentrates  are given at pasture,  
except  during  the first 7-10 days after turnout,  and from early October  
when all lactating  animals  receive  1.6 ke per day until drying  off. Animals  
are housed  with ad libitum  access  to silage from October  or November.  
The performance  for the herd during  the 12 month  period  ending  Decem ­
ber, 1978, embracing  all experimental  treatments  is given in Table 9.

This performance  indicates  that there is considerable  potential  for achiev ­

inputs  and is the basis for a very sound  dairying  industry.

Rearing  replacement  heifers
While  the management  of the dairy cow during  the productive  period  
of her life has been the major  area of research  work carried  out at Hills ­
borough,  an attempt  has also been made to provide  information  on the 
rearing  of the replacement  stock for the spring-calving  system. At the 
outset it was realised  that, with the relatively  small numbers  of replace ­
ments being reared per year at the Institute,  there was little point in 
becoming  involved  in some of the major  problems  such as age or weight 
at calving.  Instead  the approach  was adopted  that we could achieve  best 
results  by using all available  information  from other centres  throughout  
the world  on these basic questions  and use our resources  to evaluate  how 
the present  target performance  could be best achieved  within a grass  
environment.  The targets  which  have been assumed  are that two year old 
calving  is essential  on economic  grounds  and that, if adequate  lactation  
performance  is to be achieved,  a pre-calving  liveweight  of over 500 kg is 
required.  Furthermore  to achieve  an adequate  conception  rate a live- 
weight  of over 300 kg at mating  is required  and, indeed,  if the pre-calving  
target of 500 kg is to be met it is preferable  that animals  are approxi ­
mately  320 kg at mating.  The problem  in such rearing  systems  has always 
been that of achieving  adequate  growth  during  the early months  of the 
animals  life. A series of experiments  has therefore  been carried  out to 
examine  some of the factors  which might affect performance  during  this 
period.
Effect  of date of turnout  to pasture  during  the first year
In Northern  Ireland  weather  conditions  are generally  unsuitable  to 
allow young  calves  born during  the spring  to go to pasture  before  mid to 
late April. An experiment  was therefore  carried  out to examine  whether  
these animals  should  go to pasture  at this stage or, alternatively,  be re­
tained indoors  for a further  period in an effort to achieve  higher  live- 
weights  before  going  to pasture.  The experiment  was run for two seasons,  
in each season  animals  were put to pasture  either  during  late April,  late 
May or late June. In each case no concentrates  were given throughout  
the grazing  period  which lasted until mid-October.  The groups  retained  
indoors  received  2 kg concentrate  per day in addition  to grass silage. At 
pasture  all calves  grazed  together  as the leader  group  in a leader-follower  
system. The mean results  over the grazing  period  are given in Table 10.

97
During  the extra period when the animals  were maintained  indoors  
they grew considerably  faster  than the group  which  went to pasture  early.  
However,  when these groups  went to pasture  their subsequent  perfor ­
mance  was considerably  poorer  than the group  that had already  been at 
pasture. The result was that by the end of the grazing  season  the group  
put to pasture  early was of similar  liveweight  to the other two groups 
and had consumed  considerably  less concentrates  during the rearing  
period. In addition  the management  at pasture  had been much easier  
than when the animals  were retained  indoors.
From this experiment  it was found that where  animals  were given no 
supplementary  feed during  the pasture  period  a total input  of concentrates  
of approximately  375 kg per animal  was required  in addition  to silage  of 
63 “D” value during  the yearling  winter  to achieve  a mean liveweight  at 
mating  of 320 kg. The question  arose as to whether  providing  some of 
this concentrate  during  the previous  grazing  period would result in a 
better overall  performance.  An experiment  was set up to examine  the 
effect of providing  differing  proportions  of the concentrate  during  the 
grazing  period,  but maintaining  a constant  level of total concentrate  input  
per animal up to mating. Four treatments  were applied  with animals  
getting  0, 15, 36 or 57 per cent of their concentrates  during  the pasture  
period  and the remainder  during  the following  winter. All animals  were 
grazed  as a single,  leader  group  at pasture  and had ad libitum  access  to 
silage of approximately  63 “D” value during  the following  winter. The 
results  are given in Table 11.

Supplementary  concentrates  at pasture  resulted  in a slight improvement  
in liveweight  gain at pasture,  but the response  was small. By the end of 
the following  winter the group which had received  all its concentrates  
indoors  was heavier  than any of the other three groups,  indicating  that 
when adequate  high quality  pasture  is available  concentrate  supplemen ­
tation  should  be limited  to the indoor,  winter-feeding  period.
Type of concentrate  given  indoors
A further  trial has been completed  to assess  the effect of protein  con­
tent of the supplement  given in addition  to silage during  the yearling  
winter. Two supplements  consisting  of either a barley/mineral  mixture,  
containing  9 per cent crude protein,  and a barley/soyabean  mixture,  con-

in equal  amounts  of 2.1 kg per day. The effects  on silage  intake  and final 
liveweight  at the end of the winter  are shown  in Table 12.
Type of supplement  did not affect either silage dry matter  intake  or the 
liveweight  of the animals  at the end of the winter  period,  indicating  that

the cheaper  supplement  consisting  of barley  and minerals  is adequate  as 
a supplement  for silage  during  the yearling  winter.
Length  of dry period  at end of first lactation
With spring-calving  animals  in their first lactation  there is a tendency  
for body condition  to decline  considerably  during  the pasture  period,  with 
the result that the condition  of these animals  at the end of lactation  
is generally  below that of the mature  cow managed  in the same system.  
The question  arises  as to whether  this relatively  poor body condition  will 
affect subsequent  performance  and, if it does, how can it be improved.  
One approach  is to increase  the length  of the dry period  by terminating  
the first lactation  at an earlier  date. An experiment  is in progress  at the 
Institute  to examine  the effect of drying  animals  off four weeks earlier  
than normal. The preliminary  results  from this are given in Table 13.

Drying  the animals  off four weeks  earlier  than normal  increased  the fol­
lowing lactation  yield by 261 kg. However  an approximately  similar  
quantity  of milk was lost from this group  during  the first lactation,  due to 
the early drying-off,  with the effect that total production  assessed  over the 
first two lactations  was unaffected.  However  this study will continue  and 
will be extended  into subsequent  lactations  to establish  whether  there is 
any further  residual  effect.
2. Silage  Quality  
Interval  between  regrowths
The optimum  re-growth  interval  for grass for silage  has been the sub­
ject of considerable  debate  and the purpose  of some of our work has 
been to establish  the effect of different  re-growth  intervals  on milk pro­
duction.  To date two experiments  have been completed.  In the first 
experiment  re-growth  intervals  of 5 and 9 weeks  were compared  using a 
predominantly  perennial  ryegrass  sward (21). The resulting  silages  were  
offered  ad libitum  to lactating  cows with the same quantity  of concentrate  
being given with each silage. The effect of these treatments  on intake  of 
silage dry matter,  milk yield and liveweight  at the end of the experiment  
are given under  Experiment  I in Table 14.

Reducing  the regrowth  interval  from 9 to 5 weeks  resulted  in an 11 per 
cent increase  in silage  dry matter  intake  and 2.5 kg per day in milk yield.  
In the second  experiment  three silages  made after regrowth  intervals  of 
5, 7 and 9 weeks  were assessed  by again  offering  the silages  to dairy cows  
receiving  7.2 kg concentrates  per day (21). The results  are given under  
Expediment  2 in Table 14. The effect on intake  in this trial was greater  
than in the previous  one with a 33 per cent increase  in silage  dry matter  
intake being obtained  by decreasing  the regrowth  interval  from 9 to 5 
weeks. The effect on milk yield however  was similar  to that obtained  in 
Experiment  1.
102
Effect  of wilting  prior  to ensiling
A total of three experiments  have been carried  out to examine  the 
effect of wilting  prior to ensiling  on the milk producing  potential  of the 
resulting  silage (21). In all experiments  the unwilted  herbage  was ensiled  
within 15 minutes  of being mown by rotary mower  and all silages  were 
made with a precision-chop  harvester.  All silages had formic acid 
(Add-F,  B.P. Chemicals  Ltd.) applied  at the rate of approximately  2.2 
litres per tonne  of herbage  ensiled.  The length  of time required  to achieve 
the required  degree of wilt varied between  1 and 5 days in the three  
experiments.  Within  each experiment  cows on both treatments  received 
the same level of concentrate  supplementation  on a fixed daily basis.
The results  of the three experiments  are given in Table 15.

In Experiment  1 wilting  to 35 per cent dry matter  slightly,  but not sig­
nificantly,  improved  the intake  of silage dry matter  but had no effect on 
milk yield. In the second  experiment  wilting  to 47 per cent dry matter  
increased  silage intake by 11 per cent, but significantly  depressed  milk 
output. In Experiment  3 wilting  to 39 per cent dry matter  resulted  in an 
increase  in silage intake  of 10 per cent, but had no effect on milk yield.  
Over the three experiments  wilting  increased  intake  on average  by 8 per 
cent and reduced  milk yield by 2.5 per cent or 0.6 kg per day.
While  such results  do not give much encouragement  for wilting  there  
are however  two factors  which should be remembered.  Firstly fairly  
heavily  wilted silages  were used in all three experiments  and it is still 
open to question  as to whether  a response  might not be obtained  with 
more moderate  degrees  of wilting,  for example  to 25 - 28 per cent dry
103
matter. An experiment  is in progress  at present  to provide  data on this 
point. Secondly,  even if no benefit  is obtained  in terms of animal  pro­
duction  from wilting,  this does not in itself imply  that wilting  should  not 
be carried  out. The whole  concept  of wilting  is much  more  complex  than 
the effect on animal  production  and involves  pollution,  mechanisation,  
speed of harvesting,  ease of handling,  these being aspects  which each 
farmer  must take into account  in making  decisions  on the value of wilt­
ing. I also feel, however,  that there are areas within  silage  making  which 
have not to date been sufficiently  researched  to enable  the farmer  to make  
rational  decisions.  These include  the question  of the effects of silage ­
making  machinery  and harvesting  techniques  on the losses incurred  in 
silage  making  and subsequent  production  of the sward.
Protein  nutrition  on indoor diets
Over the past 20 - 30 years a considerable  volume  of research  work 
has been carried  out on the effect of level of protein  intake  on milk out­
put. In summary  it could be said that little response  has been obtained  
to increasing  protein  intake above that required  to meet theoretical  re­
quirements.  However,  there  are two aspects  which  must be borne  in mind 
before concluding  that all the answers  are known. Firstly,  the bulk of 
the evidence  has been derived  from experiments  in which  different  protein  
levels have been compared  on diets which supplied  theoretical  energy  
requirements  and, secondly,  hay has generally  been the basal diet. With 
regard  to the first point there is now sufficient  evidence  to show that there  
is an interrelationship  between  the response  to providing  additional  pro­
tein and the level of energy  intake (22). For example.  Fig. 1 shows  the 
effect on milk output  of giving  concentrates  of two protein  contents  over 
a range of feeding  levels ranging  from 0.25 - 0.58 kg per kg milk. These  
data were obtained  using cows given two concentrates  containing  either  
12 or 18 per cent protein  in addition  to a basal diet of hay which  supplied  
maintenance  energy  and protein  requirements.  The important  aspect  of 
these results was that at low rates of concentrate  supplementation  no 
benefit  was obtained  from using a concentrate  containing  more than 12 
per cent protein even though this theoretically  represented  a severe  
deficiency  in protein. However,  as the amount  of concentrates  was in­
creased  the increase  in milk yield obtained  from using  the higher  protein  
level became  larger and was greatest  at the highest  level of concentrate  
input. The results also show another  important  point which is that a 
given level of milk yield could be supported  by giving  two protein  con­
centrates  at different  rates. For example,  the 18 per cent protein  concen ­
trate given at the rate of 0.4 kg per kg milk supported  a yield of 16.9 kg 
per day which,  in turn, could alternatively  have been supported  by giving  
the 12 per cent protein  concentrate  at the rate of 0.48 kg per kg milk.  
This demonstrates  that there may be a degree of substitution  between 
protein  content  and feeding  level in the practical  situation,  which can 
become  very important  as the relative  prices  of protein  sources  and cereal 
grain change.
The work involving  intake discussed  above was carried  out with a 
basal diet of hay. However,  the majority  of cows on progressive  farms
104

within  the U.K. and Ireland  are given diets based on silage. In view of 
the fact that the crude protein  content  of silage is relatively  high, nutri ­
tionists  would argue that a low protein  supplement  would provide  for 
theoretical  protein  requirements.  There  is, however,  a growing  volume  of 
evidence  to question  this concept. For example.  Table 16 shows the 
results  from an experiment  in which  cows were given similar  amounts  of 
four concentrates,  but with the concentrates  varying  in protein  content  
from 10 to 21 per cent (23). All four concentrates  were given in addition  
to a basal diet of wilted  grass silage  with a “D” value  of 67.
While in theory  adequate  protein  was supplied  by the concentrate  con­
taining  13.7 per cent protein,  there was a considerable  increase  in milk 
output  up to 21 per cent protein  in the supplement.  A further  experiment  
was therefore  carried  out to examine  a wider range of protein  intakes  in
105

order  to establish  at what level of protein  in the concentrate  the maximum  
milk yield was obtained.  In this trial concentrates  with six protein  con­
tents ranging  from 10 to 29 per cent on a fresh basis were used (24). The 
effects  on milk output  are shown  in Fig. 2 and the relationship  between

milk yield and the percentage  protein  in the concentrate  can be described  
by the following  relationship :
Y = 8.95 + 1.0 X - 0.0205X'
where  Y = milk yield in kg/day  and X = percentage  protein  in the sup­
plement  on a fresh weight  basis. *
Using this relationship  it has been calculated  that for this particular  
silage maximum  milk yield is achieved  by giving  a concentrate  contain ­
ing 24.4 per cent protein  on a fresh basis. However,  economic  return  
is maximised  at the point where the cost of an additional  unit of 
protein  is offset by the returns  in terms of the additional  milk produced.  
At present  Northern  Ireland  prices,  a percentage  unit increase  in protein  
content  increases  the cost of the ration  by about  £1.20 per tonne. With  
milk at 1 Ip per litre an increase  of approximately  0.09 kg milk per day is 
required  to cover this cost and profit is therefore  maximised  at 22 per 
cent protein  content  in the concentrate.  £ven if the cost of increasing  
protein  content  were to double  relative  to the value of milk, profitability  
would still be maximised  with a concentrate  containing  around  20 per 
cent crude  protein.
There is, however,  one point with regard  to the response  to protein  
which as yet has been unexplained.  This refers to the fact that while 
the two previous  experiments  have shown  large responses  to protein,  a 
further  trial at Hillsborough  did not demonstrate  this effect. If the infor ­
mation  coming  from other centres  is also examined  it also appears  that 
there has been a response  in some cases but not in others. The question  
arises as to why this difference  is obtained —is it due to the animals  used 
in these trials or the silages  which  they have been given?
In an attempt  to answer  this point a changeover  trial has been carried  
out to determine  whether  the response  to increased  protein  is affected  by 
wilting  prior to ensiling.  In this trial a high digestibility  grass  was ensiled  
either directly  or after wilting  to 39 per cent dry matter. Each of these  
silages  was given with supplements  containing  13 or 21 per cent crude  
protein  on a fresh basis. The preliminary  results  from this trial are given 
in Table 17.

These results  showed  little response  to increased  protein  when the un­
wilted  material  was used yet, when the same material  was wilted,  a con­
siderable  and statistically  significant  increase  in yield was obtained  when  
the protein  content  of the supplement  was increased.  The response  of 
2.2 kg milk obtained  with the wilted material  is directly  in line with the 
response  obtained  in our earlier  trials.
Conclusion
In conclusion  let us now turn our thoughts  to some of the areas in 
which  further  research  is needed.  In this I do not want to produce  a cata­
logue of areas requiring  further  research,  but rather to concentrate  on 
what I consider  to be the major  areas within  the three topics  that I have 
discussed.
Firstly  the major  problem  confronting  us in the spring-calving  system 
is the conflict  between  maintaining  a high output  per animal,  in this case 
a high milk yield,  while ensuring  that our stocking  rates are high enough 
to efficiently  use the grass which  we grow. It has been seen that 250 - 500 
litres of milk per cow may be lost at high stocking  rates, a loss which  
cannot  be tolerated,  and an effect  which  will become  more  serious  as yield  
per cow increases.  It is likely, therefore,  that this will be an increasing  
problem  in the dairy industry  and I consider  that within the next few 
years this will be a major  factor affecting  the attitude  of the farmer. It 
is important,  therefore,  that research  workers  should  consider  ways of 
maximising  the use of grass without  severely  depressing  yield per animal.  
Unless  a solution  to this problem  is found farmers  will relax stocking  
rates and possibly  use supplementary  feeds in the quest for high milk 
yields  per cow. Both these  approaches  would  be detrimental  to the long­
term good of the industry.
Secondly,  with regards  to silage production  we are now at the stage  
where  the effects  of different  types of silages  on animal  performance  have 
been quantified.  However,  we seem to have completely  forgotten  that 
machinery  is required  to produce  silage  and remarkably  little information  
IS available  on the interaction  between  the machine  and the grass sward. 
For example,  what effect has machinery,  including  both type and weight  
of equipment,  on the quality  of the silage,  the losses  during  ensilage,  and 
subsequent  production  from the sward? It is now time that the best type 
of equipment  for silage making  has been identified  by research  workers  
and these requirements  met by the engineer,  rather  than indiscriminately  
using the equipment  produced  by manufacturers  which very often were 
designed  for conditions  completely  different  to those under which we 
operate.
Finally  our understanding  of silage supplementation  is still confused 
with, for example,  there being large and unexplained  differences  in the 
response  to supplementary  protein  between  silages. We must identify 
why this is so in order  that we can provide  a more correctly  balanced  sup­
plement,  both in terms  of energy  and protein,  for differing  types  of silages.  
We shall not be efficiently  using the feed available  until this can be 
achieved.

A COMPARISON  OF RED CLOVER  AND GRASS  SILAGES  FOR  
BEEF  PRODUCTION
R. W. J. STEEN
Agricultural  Research  Institute  uf N. Ireland,  Hillsborough,  Co. Down.
Two experiments  have been conducted  to compare  red clover and 
grass silages  for beef production  and to examine  the effects  of digestibility  
of red clover silage and the level of concentrate  supplementation  on 
animal  performance.  In the first experiment  red clover silages  of high 
and low digestibility  (700 and 600 g kg~' respectively)  were produced  by 
cutting  red clover  (van Hungaropoly)  at early and late stages  of maturity  
These silages and a grass silage (DMD 710 g kg-') which had been 
harvested  from a perennial  ryegrass  sward after a growth  interval  of 7 
weeks  were offered  ad libitum  to 48 British Friesian  steers (initial live- 
weight  229 kg) for a period  of 11 weeks.  The silages  were unsupplemented.  
Sdage  dry matter  intake  (kg day ') and animal  liveweight  gain (kg day-')  
for the three silages  were 7.75, 0.89, 6.91, 0.69, 5.59, 0.59 for the high 
digestibility  red clover, low digestibility  red clover and grass silages  
respectively.
In the second  experiment  red clover silage (DMD  625 g kg”') and 
grass  silage  (DMD  755 g kg"')  which  had been harvested  from a pierennial  
ryegrass  sward after a growth  interval  of 9 weeks were offered  unsup ­
plemented  or supplemented  with 2 kg of fortified  barley  per head per day 
to 48 British  Friesian  steers (initial  liveweight  332 kg) for a period  of 19 
weeks. Silage  dry matter  intake,  animal  liveweight  gain and carcase  gain 
data for this trial were presented.

INITIAL  RESULTS  OF A DAIRY  HERD  SURVEY  IN 
NORTHERN  IRELAND
W. J. McCAUGHEY,  C. H. McMURRAY  and E. A. GOODALL  
Veterinary  Research  Laboratories.  Storniont,  Belfast.
A stratified  random  sample  of 600 herds (230 cows per herd) was 
investigated  by interview.  Returns  were received  from 515 herds rep­
resenting  17% of all dairy cows. These returns  are being examined  for 
interactions  between  fertility  and those factors  which  have been consid- 
ered to influence  the results  achieved.
There was a significant  difference  between  the calving pattern of 
heifers  (concentrated  in October-November)  and cows (distributed  uni­
formly  from October  to March). This difference  may be the result of 
cumulative  time lost annually  through  reduced  fertility.
There was widespread  use of three breeding  policies,  i.e. Bull only,  
A.I. only and A.I. plus bull. Almost  equal numbers  of cows are mated  
by A.I. and by Bull. The overall  non-return  rate was 71%. Herds  using 
bulls for all breeding  had the highest  non return  rate; those  with A.I. had 
the lowest  and the dual policy  gave an intermediate  value. These  records  
resulted  in tighter  calving  patterns  in the herds  using bulls.
Only 40% of herds achieved  a target  of 10 cwt. heifers  calving  at 24 
months. Repeat  breeding  was a problem  associated  with underweight  
heifers  (< 950 lbs) at calving. Difficult  calving  and retained  placentae  
were frequently  reported  as problems  but resulted  in very few sales.  
Repeat  breeding  in cows was a more serious  problem  in the summer  
than in the winter  and frequently  the affected  cow was sold.
Fertility  was lower on farms  using over 300 units nitrogen  per acre on 
silage  grass. The data do not show that this was a direct  effect.
Emphasis  on heat detection  was highly variable  and was correlated  
with the breeding  policy adopted.  There appears  to be considerable  
scope for improvement  in this area.
The data collected  indicates  that a more detailed  study into the 
individual  animal ’s fertility  is necessary  before  detailed  interactions  can 
be determined.

A COMPARISON  OF CONSTANT  RATE  AND VARIABLE  
CONCENTRATE  FEEDING  FOR DAIRY  COWS
P. A. GLEESON
Agricultural Institute,  Moorepark,  Fernioy,  Co. Cork.
Thirty Friesian  spring calving  dairy cows were allocated  to two 
experimental  treatments  :
(1) fed silage ad libitum  with 7.27 kg (109 kg for the group)  of a 16 
percent  crude protein  dairy ration  per head per day;
(2) fed silage ad libitum  and a total concentrate  allowance  to the group  
of 109 kg per day but allocated  to cows in relation  to milk yield.
Cows  were assigned  to treatment,  after a minimum  period  of three weeks  
post calving,  based on the milk yield of the last week of the preliminary  
period.
The mean  milk yields  for this final week were 22 kg (range 16.3-27.1  
for treatment  1 and 22.2 (range 16.4-27.6)  for 2. The mean lactation  
number  was 6.4 and 6.1 for treatments  1 and 2 respectively.  Concentrate  
feeding  levels for treatment  2 were adjusted  at weeks  2, 4 and 6 based 
on milk yields  of the two previous  weeks. The experimental  period  lasted 
8 weeks. Cows  were individually  housed  and offered  silage at 10 percent  
in excess  of daily intake,  all refusals  being recorded  daily. The daily  
concentrate  allowance  was fed in two equal feeds. Milk yields were  
recorded  5 days per week,  milk fat and protein  determined  once weekly  
and liveweight  were recorded  once weekly.
There  were no significant  differences  between  treatments  in milk yield, 
milk fat or protein  percentage.  Silage  intakes  were lower  on the variable  
concentrate  group and cows lost more liveweight.  Those  cows in treat ­
ment 2 receiving  the greatest  amount  of concentrates  had a much lower 
intake  (1.3% l.wt) than the cows on the lower concentrate  levels (1.6%  
l.wt). The results  indicate,  in the absence  of competition,  that variable  
rate feeding  has no advantage  over constant  rate feeding  for cows at the 
same stage of lactation.
EMBRYO  MORTALITY  IN THE COW  
M. G. DISKIN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
Reproductive  failure is one of the major factors  affecting  output  in 
either  the beef or dairy  cow herds. Although  it is generally  accepted  that 
fertilization  rates following  either natural  or artificial  insemination  are 
normally  close to 90%, calving  rates to a single insemination  are closer  
to 50%. While  most reports  demonstrate  the existence  and extent  of this 
embryonic  loss few of them indicate  the timing  at which  it occurs.
Studies  were carried  out to determine  the fertilization  and embryo  
survival  rates at various  stages  after insemination.
Fertilization  rate was estimated  at 90% following  the use of frozen- 
thawed  semen. However  the embryo  survival  rate at Day 42 was 52%.  
The extent  and timing  of this embryonic  loss was discussed.  Advances  in 
this area could contribute  significantly  to an increased  reproductive  rate.

INCREASING  THE CALVING  AND TWINNING  RATE  IN THE
BEEF  HERD
J. M. SREENAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam.  Co. Galway.
The recent  decline  in beef numbers  will have serious  repercussions  on 
beef output  over the next few years.  Expansion  in the dairy  herd sufficient  
to offset this reduction  is unlikely,  due to levelling  off of milk prices.  
Increasing  the number  of calves  born is now an urgent  necessity  for the 
beef industry.  Management  can play a major  role in determining  repro ­
ductive  rate and intensive  management  will shorten  the post partum  
interval  and increase  the conception  rate.
Over the past few years part of the research  programme  in cow 
fertility  at Belciare  has been devoted  to the induction  of twinning  as one 
possible  means of increasing  the national  calf crop with particular  re­
ferences  to single  suckler  herds.
Two aspects  of twinning  are being  examined  :
1. Twinning  by PMSG  (mild superovulation)
The production  of a low level of twinning  by administration  of PMSG  
at low doses 500-800  i.u. in conjunction  with heat synchronization.  
This has given a twinning  rate of 10% and a 15% increase  in the 
conception  rate.
2. Twinning  by embryo  transfer
This involves  the collection  of embryos  from donor cows and their  
transfer  non-surgically  to the contralateral  uterine horn of bred 
recipients.  Pregnancy  rates of 60% and a twinning  rate of 60% of 
pregnant  animals  were obtained.

THE EFFECT  OF MONENSIN  ON THE PERFORMANCE  OF
STORE  LAMBS
A. KINSELLA  and J. L. L’ESTRANGE  
Department  of Agriculture  Chemistry,  U.C.D.,  GUisnevin,  Dublin  9.
Monensin  (Rumensin),  used as a feed additive,  has been found to 
improve  the feed conversion  ratio (FCR) of beef animals  on a wide  
range of diets. This effect is thought  to be due to an alteration  of 
fermentation  in rumen fluid resulting  in increased  propionic  acid and 
decreased  acetic acid production.  In the experiments  reported  here, the 
effects  of Monensin  on the performance  of store lambs fattened  indoors  
were studied.
In experiment  1, forty-eight  Cheviot  ram lambs were fed a whole 
barley-based  concentrate  diet containing  0, 15, or 30 ppm Monensin,  fed 
ad libitum  with or without  a supplement  of long hay. Monensin  at both 
levels improved  live-weight  gain and FCR but not significantly  so. It 
significantly  increased  the proportion  of propionic  acid in the rumen  
fluid of the lambs,  while it decreased  the proportions  of acetic  and butyric  
acids. The response  to Monensin  was significantly  greater  when hay was 
supplemented.
In Experiment  2, which was a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial  design,  forty-eight  
Cheviot  ram lambs were fed a whole barley or a molassed  beet pulp- 
based concentrate  diet, containing  0 or 30 ppm Monensin  fed ad libitum,  
with or without  a supplement  of long hay. Feed intake,  live-weight  gain 
and FCR were significantly  better on the beet pulp than on the barley  
treatments.  However,  Monensin  did not improve  the performance  of the 
lambs  and had little effect  on rumen  fermentation.  There  was little effect  
also caused  by hay supplementation.

GRAZING  BEHAVIOUR  OF SHEEP  AND CATTLE  IN 
MIXED  GRAZING
T. NOLAN,  J. CONNOLLY  and M. dc RANCOURT  
Agricultural  Institute,  Creagh,  Ballinrohe,  Co. Mayo.
A three year experiment  showed  that mixed grazing  increased  in­
dividual  weaned  lamb and 1^-year  old steer liveweight  gains by 10 to 
30%. The benefit  to either  species  increased  as the proportion  in the mix 
decreased.  This experiment  attempted  to explain  the role of complemen ­
tary grazing  with particular  reference  to sheep grazing  ‘fouled ’ herbage  
(High  Grass)  around  the cattle  dung  pat areas  which  cattle refuse.
The results  show that on an area basis both cattle and sheep had 
marked  preferences  for High as opposed  to Low Grass in terms  of time 
spent grazing. The sheep preference  was generally  twice that of the 
cattle. On a DM basis cattle grazed High Grass in proportion  to the 
amount  of High Grass  DM present  and sheep  preference  continued  to be 
about  twice that of cattle.
Comparisons  at the beginning  and end of grazing  a paddock  showed  
that both cattle and sheep preferences  for High Grass increased  sig­
nificantly  with time on both an area and DM bases. The increase  was 
far greater  for area (about 206%)  than for DM (about 68%). Sheep 
preference  was twice that for cattle at the start and finish of grazing  and 
for an area and DM bases.
Results  for four time periods  showed  that on an DM basis cattle  
preference  for High Grass was significant  for the first period only and 
was less marked  as the grazing  season  advanced.  On an area basis  cattle  
had a marked  preference  for High Grass during all periods. Sheep 
preference  for High Grass  was significant  during  the first and last periods  
and exceeded  cattle preference  by a factor of about two on an area or 
DM basis.

EFFECTS  OF EWE PROLIFICACY  ON SHEEP  INCOME
S. FLANAGAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
The effects of crossing  Galway  sheep with very prolific  breeds on 
litter size have been reported  previously.  However,  there was a lack of 
recorded  information  on the financial  consequences  arising  from the use 
of new sheep breeds. Consequently,  at Blindwell  ewe performance  and 
income  were compared  in two breeds  of lowland  sheep which differ 
widely  in prolificacy.  The two breeds,  Galway  and Improved  Galway,  
were managed  under commercial  farm conditions  and under the one 
system  of husbandry.
Over the two years 1977 and 1978 the Improved  Galway  breed pro­
duced on average  0.3 more lambs per ewe lambing  compared  with the 
Galway.  The superiority  of the Improved  Galway  for lamb sales (£) per 
100 ewes to the ram amounted  to 30% on average  over the two years. 
Gross  margin  per ewe was improved  by over 45% when Improved  Gal­
way ewes were used instead  of Galway  ewes.
It is concluded  that large cash benefits  are feasible  when sheep 
breeding  research  results  are translated  into farm practice.

BREED  DIFFERENCES  IN THE RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  
EWE BODYWEIGHT  AND PRODUCTIVITY
J. P. HANRAHAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam,  Co, Galway.
It is well known that there is a positive  relationship  between  ewe 
liveweight  and fecundity  (litter size). Since most studies  on this topic  
have used ewes of low to moderate  fecundity  and future interest  will be 
in more prolific  breeds  it will be important  to know whether  bodyweight  
is more critical  with very prolific  ewes. Also, if breed differences  exist  
in the bodyweight/fecundity  relationship  this would  imply  different  cost/  
benefit  functions.  The data reported  relate  to analyses  of ewe bodyweight  
/ litter size relationships  in Galway,  J Finn, Fingalway  and High Fertility  
flocks  which are part of the sheep breeding  research  flocks  of The Agri ­
cultural  Institute.  In addition,  factors affecting  ewe bodyweight  have 
been examined  in 15 pedigree  Galway  flocks  over two years. The within  
flock relationships  between  ewe bodyweight  and litter size and lamb  
growth  rate pre-weaning  have also been examined.  Bodyweight  in all 
cases refers  to weight  at the time of mating  (October).
The major  difference  between  the genetic  groups  studied  is in fecun ­
dity. The average  litter sizes (1972-1978)  were 1.4, 1.7, 2.0 and 2.0 for 
Galway,  i Finn,  Fingalway  and High Fertility,  respectively.  The relation ­
ship between  bodyweight  and litter size was examined  graphically  for 
each breed group  and 2-tooth  ewes were treated  separately.  For mature  
ewes the results  show a pronounced  breed difference  with essentially  no 
relationship  in the Fingalway  and High Fertility groups  and a pronounced  
positive  relationship  in the Galway  and Finn groups. In the case of 
2-tooth  ewes all breeds  showed  a positive  relationship  at low weights  but 
there was an apparent  plateau at higher weights  for the two high 
fecundity  breed groups.
The pattern  of relationships  seen for litter size were also evident  for 
ovulation  rate but the volume  of data was much smaller.
For pedigree  Galway  ewes the within-flock  regression  of litter size 
on bodyweight  (kg) was 0.012  + 0.003 in the 1974/75  data set and 0.011  + 
0.()04 in the 1975/76  data set. The relationship  between  lamb average  
daily gain and ewe bodyweight  was not significant  for the 1974/75  data 
set (0.0001+0.0004)  but was highly significant  in the second data set 
(0.()012±0.0003).  Flock  differences  accounted  for approximately  50% of 
variation  in age-adjusted  bodyweight.  Single-born  ewes were heavier  
than multiple  born ewes at all ages; the average  difference  was 2.8 kg. 
Ewe bodyweight  was also influenced  by litter size in the previous  spring  
—ewes which  produced  singles  were heavier  at weighing  in October  than 
ewes which produced  multiples.  This effect however  depended  on ewe 
age and flock.
Breed differences  in the ewe bodyweight/litter  size relationship  sug­
gest that bodyweight  at mating  is less critical  in highly  prolific  ewes with 
consequent  savings  on inputs  at this time which  may yield a higher  return  
at around  lambing  time.
CONTRIBUTIONS  TO IMPROVED  SOW PRODUCTION
N. WALKER
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of N. Ireland.  Hillsborough.  Co. Down.
Rearing  more bonhams  per sow per year invariably  increases  profits. 
Production  can commence  earlier  by mating  gilts at puberty  rather  than 
at a later oestrus  and is likely  to produce  more pigs per unit time. Puberty  
can be advanced  slightly  with various  stimuli  but does not appear  to be 
retarded  by rearing  gilts with contemporary  boars.
The frequency  with which  mature  boars  are used for mating  has some  
effect on litter size.
Re-establishing  pregnancy  in the weaned  sow, especially  after the 
first parity,  is an aspect  of management  where improvements  are often  
possible.  The social stimulus  of group-housing  newly-weaned  sows was 
not beneficial  under  our conditions.  However,  exogenous  hormone  given  
on the day of weaning  to primiparous  sows reduced  the mean time to 
conception  and increased  subsequent  litter size. Confirmation  of preg­
nancy  has been tested  with a commercial  ultrasonic  device  which,  together  
with vaginal  biopsy  data,  suggests  that the incidence  of pregnancies  which 
are terminated  around  mid-gestation  may warrant  further  consideration.
A comparison  of weaning  ages of 10, 25 or 40 days showed  that 
maximum  sow production  on a herd basis was achieved  with 10 day 
weaning.
It has been suggested  that lactating  sows have a latent heat three  
weeks  post partum  and that early-weaning  prior to this will result in a 
shorter  time to conception.  Our evidence  does not support  this thesis.  
Regardless  of weaning  age the productivity  of a sow herd is dominated  
by first and second  parity animals  and in particular  by the size of their  
litters.
The number  of pigs born per litter should  be increased  by all possible 
means  since it is now becoming  possible  to identify  the rearing  capabil ­
ities of the sow and to rear ‘surplus ’ piglets  artificially.

EFFECTS  OF PHYSICAL  FORM  OF DIET  AND  DIETARY  LEVEL  
OF SKIM  MILK  POWDER  ON PERFORMANCE  OF PIGS  
WEANED  AT 2-3 WEEKS  OF AGE
D. C. PATTERSON
Af^riciiltitral  Research  Institute  of N. Ireland,  HiUshorouf ’h, Co. Down.
A total of 180 pigs weaned  within 13-19 days of age, of 4.7 kg mean  
initial liveweight  and penned  in groups  of 6 were assigned  to a 3 x 2 
factorial  experiment  in which three physical  forms of starter  diet were 
each followed  by two physical  forms of grower  diet. The forms of 
starter  diet were pellets  (4.75 mm diam.),  ground  meal and flaky meal.  
The flaky form was created  by omitting  to grind the flaked  maize which 
was present  in the starter  diets at a level of 200 g/kg. The forms of 
grower  diet were pellets  (4.75 mm diam.)  and ground  meal. The change  
from starter to grower  occurred  at 12.5 kg liveweight  with both diets  
given  ad libitum.  Meal diets gave a higher  liveweight  gain from weaning  
to 12.5 kg liveweight  but the difference  between  the meal and pellet  forms  
was small during  the 12.5 to 25 kg liveweight  stage. Pelleted  diets gave 
superior  conversion  ratios during  both stages. The flaky meal form of 
the starter  diet gave a slightly  slower  growth  rate than the ground  meal 
form from weaning  to 12.5 kg liveweight.
In a 4 X 3 X 2 factorial  experiment  four levels of skim milk powder  
in the starter  diet were combined  with three times  of changeover  to the 
grower  diet and two levels  of skim milk powder  in the grower  diet. The 
levels of skim milk powder  in the starter  diets were 0, 100, 200 and 300 
g/kg,  the changeover  times  were 7, 14 and 21 days post-weaning  and the 
levels  of skim milk powder  in the grower  diet were 0 and 100 g/kg. All 
diets were offered  ad libitum.  Ninety-six  pigs weaned  at 19-22 days of 
age were allocated  to the experiment.  The greater  the skim milk content  
of the starter  diet the higher  the rate of liveweight  gain and the lower  the 
feed conversion  ratio. With each incremental  change  of 100 g skim milk 
powder  per kg starter  diet daily liveweight  gain increased  by about 17 
g/day  and feed conversion  ratio improved  by 0.03 units. The pigs grew  
faster when skim milk was included  in the grower  diet but there was no 
consistent  response  to variations  in the time when the starter  diet was 
replaced  with the grower  diet.

FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE EFFICIENCY  OF FEED  
UTILIZATION  IN PIGS
T. J. HANRAHAN
Agriculiural  Institute.  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
This experiment  was designed  to assess  the effect  of diet form on feed 
utilization  efficiency.  The Moorepark  standard  diet fed in meal form 
(control),  pelleted,  or with 2% added fat were compared.  Digestibility  
studies indicated  that the meal, pelleted,  and 2% fat diets contained  
3.035, 3.007 and 3.085 Meal D.E./kg  respectively.  The slightly  lower 
digestible  energy  content  of the pellets  corresponded  with their lower  dry 
inatter  and suggests  that pelleting  does not improve  the digestibility  of 
diets. The feeding  trial involved  576 pigs penned  in groups  of 16 and 
housed  in a conventional  type building  which was naturally  wentilated,  
with temperature  maintained  around  2 PC. All pens had a 1.83 meter  
feed hopper  and an ad libitum  supply  of water. Sufficient  feed to last a 
six hour feeding  period  was allocated  each morning.  Pigs fed the pelleted  
and fat supplemented  diets had feed utilization  efficiencies  5% and 2% 
respectively  better than the meal fed pigs. The improved  efficiency  on 
the fat supplemented  diet is no more than expected  from the digestibility  
data whereas  the pelleted  diet performed  above expectation.  This sug­
gests considerable  wastage  of feed in the case of the meal and fat 
supplemented  diets. Visable  feed wastage  was not observed.

Influence  of Pasture  Type on 
Animal  Production
V. CONNOLLY
Agricultural  Institute.  Oakpark,  Carlow.
The influence  of pasture  type on animal  production  has been the subject  
of much research  and debate  for many years. There  are some aspects  on 
which there is general  agreement.  For example,  pastures  with a good 
white  clover  balance  are more productive  than those without  this legume.  
In Ireland  and U.K. the more productive  pastures  have reasonably  high 
levels of ryegrass.  There is much less agreement  on other aspects  such 
as the relative  merits  of different  varieties  of ryegrass.  Differences  be­
tween ryegrass  varieties  in terms  of dry matter  yield under frequent  and 
infrequent  cutting  are well established.  There is, however,  no reliable  
way in which productivity  under cutting  can be translated  into animal  
performance.
The results  presented  in this paper  deal with the relative  performance  
of four varieties  of ryegrass  measured  in terms  of animal  production  over 
a period  of six years. Three stocking  rates were imposed  on each of the 
four varieties  as follows  :
Varieties :
— Tailteann : Early Poor persistency
— S24 : Early Good persistency
— S23 Late Good persistency
— Reveille
Stocking  rates : (at 
— Low 
— Medium  - High: Early
turn-out) kg/ha
2,000
2,500
3,000Tertaploid,  medium  
persistency
In such experiments  it is necessary  to include  varying  stocking  levels 
in order to arrive at valid conclusions.  This is the reason  for the very 
high stocking  rates which  severely  depress  animal  performance.
The level of nitrogen  fertiliser  use was 245 kg/ha/annum  in five 
applications.  The duration  of the grazing  season  was from the first week 
of April to the first week  of November  and the grazing  cycle  was 20 days. 
Stocking  rates were reduced  by 45% in July after five grazing  cycles.
Results
Liveweight  gain from each variety  averaged  over stocking  rates for 
each year is shown  in Table  I. Productivity  was high. On the best treat ­
ments  (Reveille  and S 23 medium  stocking  rate) production  was never

less than 1100 kg/ha  liveweight  gain in any year. The first year (1975)  
showed  a very high level of production,  this is a phenomenon  frequently  
associated  with new re-seeds  where  the performance  in the initial  year is 
some 10-20%  higher  than in subsequent  seasons.
Differences  between  varieties  are summarised  in Table 2 in terms of 
carrying  capacity  relative  to S 24 = 100.

The main features  of these results  are :
S 23 and Reveille  were consistently  superior  in stock carrying  capacity  
to S24 and Tailteann  was poorer  than S 24 except  in the first harvest  year. 
The degree  of superiority  of S 23 and Reveille  over the whole season  is 
about 10% relative  to S 24 and about 16% relative  to Tailteann.  Dry 
matter  yield data over a period  of two years  obtained  by frequent  cutting  
of these four varieties  in a separate  experiment  are presented  in Table 3.
These  results  show that dry matter  yield as measured  by cutting  is not 
a good guide to animal  performance.
Seasonal  differences
The varieties  showed  large differences  in seasonal  production  and 
these are summarised  in Table 4. The grazing  season  was divided  into 
two periods  ; (1) April to July and (2) July to end of October.

♦ In 1975 Period  1 =80 days; stocking  rate was reduced  after four cycles  of grazing  
because  of drought  conditions.
Future capital  developments  include  the erection  of extra cubicles 
for beef cattle,  installation  of cubicles  in hayshed  for extra yearlings  and 
the extension  of the slatted  area for wintering  sheep.
These results  show that the stock carrying  capacity  of the tetraploid  
in the first period relative  to all other varieties  was very high. It is of 
interest  to note that S 23 (a late variety)  is better than S 24 (an early  
variety)  in this period  (with the exception  of 1975 when the duration  of 
Period  1 was shorter  than usual). This was due to two factors:
(1) Period  1 covers  the peak production  of all varieties;
(2) S 24 is not nearly  as good in terms of animal  production  in this 
early  period  as would  be expected  on the basis  of dry matter  yield  
data.
S 23 and Reveille  produced  similar  total annual  liveweight  gains and 
the differences  between  these two varieties  were mainly  seasonal. The 
seasonal  pattern  of growth  of these two varieties  is shown  in Fig. 1. The 
major disadvantage  of S 23 is low production  in the first 60 days after  
turn out while the main weakness  of Reveille  is low production  in the 
July/August  period.
Another  aspect  of seasonal  productivity  is summarised  in Table  5. This 
shows the proportion  of the total annual liveweight  gain which was 
obtained  in the period  April  - July (100 days). The results  demonstrate  
the degree to which production  is concentrated  into this early period. 
Even for a late variety  such as S 23, 75% or more of the total annual  
potential  liveweight  gain is obtained  at this time.

Although  the performance  of S 23 was superior  to the other varieties  
from mid-July  onwards,  the carrying  capacity  of all swards  during  this 
second  part of the grazing  season  was low. The stocking  rate reduction  
of 45% which  was made at this time was not great enough  to maintain  
liveweight  per animal  at a level comparable  to that of Period 1 at all 
stocking  levels.
Persistency
Table  6 summarises  the persistency  levels  of the four varieties.  These  
results  were based  on dry matter  yield of the sward  components.
As expected  S 23 showed  the highest  persistency  level. The tetraploid  
varieties  are generally  reputed  to have low persistency  levels. These  data 
show that Reveille  persisted  well at all stocking  rates and was equal to 
the values  obtained  for S 24.

Summary
The data collected  over six years show  that pasture  type as influenced  
by the sown  variety  has an effect  on animal  output. The results  obtained  
here are restricted  to a high nitrogen  input system. In a low nitrogen  
system where greater reliance  would be placed on clover then the 
superiority  of S 23 is likely to decrease  but the tetraploid  would very 
likely  retain  its position  because  it is compatible  with good clover  growth.  
The results  emphasise  the high animal  output  capacity  of some of the 
new tetraploid  varieties. The data refer specifically  to the earlier  tetra ­
ploid perennial  varieties  such as Reveille.  Greater  use of such tetraploids  
in mixtures  designed  primarily  for grazing  or one silage cut plus grazing  
would  seem desirable.

A Demonstration  of High  Beef Output  
on a Conimereial  Farm
E. NAUGHTON  
Moyliss,  Roscommon.
A. KILCLINE
Committee  of Agriculture,  Roscommon
In 1974 a three year trial was initiated  for the purpose  of demonstrating  
the effects  of stocking  rate on beef output  per acre. The trial was under ­
taken on part of E. Naughton ’s farm, in co-operation  with the Advisory  
Service  and Department  of Agriculture.
The farm consists  of 138 adjusted  acres and the soil type is a heavy 
brown  earth suitable  for all livestock  and tillage  enterprises.  Tradition ­
ally the farm in common  with other farms  in the vicinity  was an extensive 
dry stock/sheep  enterprise  farm. Fertilizer  application  has been increased  
over the past 10 years and pH and soil fertility  is currently  being main ­
tained  at a high level.
Layout  of trial
Cattle  were stocked  on the allocated  areas at three different  levels up 
to July when the stocking  rates were reduced  for the remainder  of the 
grazing  season. The details  were as follows :

Fertilizers
A basal dressing  of 3 cwt. 0.10.20  per ace was applied  in November.  
Application  of nitrogen  fertilizer  consisted  of;
2 cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all plots on March  1 
1 cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all plots in June/July  
1^ cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all ‘High ’ plots in July 
1 cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all plots in August/September
Results
Liveweight  gains per animal  and per acre are summarised  in Tables  
1 and 2. The results show that whilst the greatest  liveweight  gain per 
animal  was achieved  on the medium  stocking  rate, the highest  gain per 
acre was obtained  on the high stocking  rate.

It is concluded  that intensive  stocking  is feasible  on this farm, which  
is representative  of the surrounding  area, and that there is potential  for a 
much  greater  volume  of beef output  per acre than that achieved  in tradi ­
tional practice. To realise this objective,  the following  management  
details  are essential ;
1. Rest pasture  during  winter.
2. Maintain  soil fertility.
3. Apply  N fertilizer  six weeks  before  initial  grazing.
4. Good grass swarth  at time of cattle turnout.
5. Good  fencing  and water  supply.
12
6. Rest paddocks  before  grazing.
7. Control  of fluke and worms.
Farm development  plan
The development  plan, using  experience  gained  from the stocking  rate 
trial, is aimed  at extending  a high stocking  rate over the whole  farm. The 
development  is phased  as follows :

The targets  include  the production  of 85 beef cattle from weanling  
purchased  18 months  earlier,  the maintenance  of 160 ewes by 1981 and a 
tillage  rotation  to provide  the opportunity  for establishing  high yielding 
pastures.
For servicing  this expansion  in stock numbers  the following  capital  
programme  has been implemented :
• erection  of feeding,  housing  and slurry accommodation  for 60 
fattening  cattle;
• cubicles,  silo and slurry  pit for 30 weanlings;
• covered  slats for 100 ewes;
• farm roadway.

Reducing  Winter  Feed Costs  
in Beef Production
M. DRENNAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
The three most important  factors  which determine  the profitability  of 
fattening  cattle in winter  are;
1. Total feed costs.
2. Animal  performance.
3. The autumn  to spring  cattle price increase.
The total non-feed  cost of keeping  a fattening  animal  for a 140 day 
winter  period  will vary with circumstances  but for the present  discussion  
a figure of £55 is taken. Included  in this cost are total interest  charges,  
repayments  on building  and other overhead  costs,  transport  and market ­
ing, mortality  and dosing  costs. It is appreciated  that these costs may be 
substantially  lower in many instances  particularly  when repayments  on 
buildings  do not apply.
Cattle  price increases  are likely  to make smaller  contributions  to pro­
fits in the coming  years than in the recent  past and thus more emphasis  
will need to be placed  on feed costs and animal  performance.  The effects  
of these two factors  on returns  are shown in Table 1 where the price  
increase  is taken at only £5 per 100 kg. Using  this price increase  a daily  
gain of 0.7kg per day is required  in order to break-even  when total feed 
costs are as low as £50 for a 140 day winter  period. The data show that 
high rate of gain and low feed costs are very important  if profitability  is 
to be maximised.

Chemical  treatment  of straw
Methods  have been developed  whereby  the feeding  value of straw  
can be improved  by treating  it with a chemical.  Both sodium  hydroxide  
and ammonia  treatment  methods  have been investigated  at Grange  but
15
no data are available  on the latter method  with fattening  animals. The 
results  of a trial in which  fattening  bulls (400 kg initially)  were fed 5 kg 
concentrates  (75% barley, 23% soyabean  and 2% minerals/vitamins)  
per head daily and either untreated  or sodium  hydroxide  treated  barley  
straw  to appetite  is shown  in Table  2.

Livewt.  gain (kg) (187 days) 155 161
Carcass  gain (kg) 83 104
Daily straw DM intake (kg) 5.3 5.6
Although  there were only small differences  between  treatments  in live- 
weight gains the killing-out  percentages  of animals  fed the sodium 
hydroxide  treated  straw were significantly  greater  than when untreated  
straw was fed. Thus over 187-day  feeding  period  carcass  weight  gains 
of animals  fed untreated  and treated  straws  were 85 and 104 kg respec ­
tively. Daily straw  dry matter  intakes  were 5.3 and 5.6 kg for untreated  
and treated  material  respectively.  The dry matter  digestibility  of untreated  
and treated  straws  were 45 and 61% respectively.  While  digestibility  was 
improved  as a result of treatment  it should be noted that the final 
material  was of relatively  low feeding  value. When  the cost of treatment  
(about  £20 per tonne of straw)  and the increased  straw intake are con­
sidered  the increased  gain from treatment  is only about  sufficient  to meet 
the added  costs.
Fodder  beet roots
A number  of experiments  have been carried  out in which pulped  
fodder  beet roots were compared  with barley as a supplement  to grass 
silage for fattening  cattle. The silages  were fed to appetite  in each ex­
periment  and were in general  of high digestibility  and properly  preserved.
In six experiments,  silage was fed alone to one group  of animals  and 
a second  group  was fed supplementary  barley  (2^ kg in four experiments  
and 5.0 kg in the other two experiments)  with silage. Other treatment  
groups  received  a similar  level of supplementary  dry matter  as an alter ­
native to barley  either as fodder  beet alone or as fodder  beet/soyabean  
meal. A summary  of these experiments  is presented  in Tables  3 and 4. 
The results  show that when fodder  beet alone was fed the extra carcass  
produced  was only 57 percent  of that obtained  from a similar  level of 
supplementary  barley  dry matter. However,  as a supplement  to silage, 
fodder  beet/soyabean  meal gave additional  carcass  gains which were 91

that the depression  in silage intake from the same quantity  of supple ­
mentary  dry matter  was the same for the various  supplements.
Molasses
At present  prices  molasses  is a relatively  cheap  feed when compared  
with barley  as a supplement  for fattening  animals  fed high quality  silage.  
For the purpose  of the comparisons  molasses  was assumed  to have an 
energy  value 70 percent  of that in barley.  The supplements  fed with silage  were :
(1) 3.0 kg rolled barley.
(2) 4.3 kg molasses.
(3) 3.6 kg molasses  plus 0.45 kg soyabean  meal.
The results  in Table 5 show that when additional  protein  was pro­
vided as soyabean  meal the supplement  of molasses  gave carcass  gains  
similar  to that obtained  from barley.

Information  is lacking  where molasses  forms a higher  proportion  of the 
total diet and this aspect  is at present  being investigated.
Comparison  of different  diets for fattening  cattle
In order to examine  the possible  role of fodder  beet, molasses  and 
treated  straw in rations  for fattening  cattle, diets based on these feeds  
are compared.  The usable yields and production  costs of the various  
crops are shown  in Table  6.

in similar  costs per unit of feed energy  for the three crops. Three  diets  
using different  supplements  with silage  calculated  to produce  a daily gain 
of 0.9 kg per day in fattening  cattle  are presented  in Table  7.

A fourth  diet based on sodium  hydroxide  treated  straw (5.5 kg per day) 
and 5.5 kg concentrates  (78% barley,  20% soyabean  meal,  2% minerals/  
vitamins)  per animal  daily is compared  with these in Table  8 in terms  of 
feed costs and acres required  per 100 cattle  for a 140-day  feeding  period.

Using  diet A (based  on silage  and purchased  barley)  as standard,  feed 
costs per animal  is reduced  by £9.50 per head as a result of replacing  
purchased  barley  by molasses/soyabean  meal (diet B). The land require ­
ments  are similar  for diets A and B. While  the diet based  on fodder  beet 
is the most attractive,  it must be remembered  that production  costs are 
high and these results  are dependent  on high yields per acre. Although  
the diet based on treated  straw and concentrates  is only slightly  more  
expensive  than diet A the acreage  required  is increased  by almost  50 
percent  as all feed except  soyabean  meal is home produced  and per acre 
production  from barley  is low.
The data illustrate  the importance  of (a) obtaining  high yields  of high 
quality  inaterial  with home produced  feed and (b) the feed cost per unit 
of digestible  energy  with purchased  feeds.
Level  of barley  feeding  with silage
The optimum  level of barley for fattening  cattle fed silage depends  
on a number  of factors. To estimate  this level a brief summary  of feed­
ing experiments  carried  out at Grange  is now presented  and economic  
returns  are calculated,  using various  winter cattle price increases  and 
barley  prices.

The data presented  in Table  9 are the average  results  from a number  
of experiments  in which  cattle  were fed grass silage  alone  or with different  
levels of supplementary  barley. The responses  from feeding  1.8 and 3.6 
kg of barley  per animal  daily were then calculated  and adjusted  to a 140- 
day feeding  period. The responses  are shown  in Table 10.

Liveweight ■ 7.0 15.1
Carcass  weight 10.9 20.0
The average  daily liveweight  gain of animals  fed silage  alone  was 0.57 
kg which  demonstrates  that moderate  to high quality  silages  were used in 
these studies. When calculated  over a 140-day  feeding  period,  animals  
fed 1.8 and 3.6 kg barley  daily gained  23 and 36 kg more carcass  weight 
than those  fed silage  alone. Feeding  1.8 and 3.6 kg barley  daily depressed  
silage  intakes  by 10.0 and 18.5 percent  respectively.  A good response  in 
terms of animal  performance  was obtained  from feeding  the first 1.8 kg 
of barley  daily but increasing  the levels of supplementation  from 1.8 to 
3.6 kg resulted  in a major decline  in the liveweight  and carcass  weight 
responses  to supplementation.

From these results,  the financial  returns  were calculated  for a farm  
example  involving  a winter  feeding  period  of 140-days  where  600 tonnes  
silage  are available.  The number  of cattle  (400 kg initially)  which  can be 
carried  for 140 days is 100, 111 and 123 where  0, 1.8 and 3.6 kg of barley 
are fed respectively.
In order  to place the returns  to barley  feeding  in their proper  prospec ­
tive, the financial  returns  from feeding  silage alone are shown  in Table  
11 using various  purchase  and selling prices. As used here, financial 
return  means  the difference  between  the sale price of animals  and cost of 
animals,  housing,  dosing  etc., including  the interest  on money  invested 
in these items where this is applicable.  A charge  for labour  is not in­
cluded  in the costs. This table shows that when silage only is fed, a 
winter  cattle price increase  of £8 to £9 per 100 kg. is required  to break ­
even. The price increase  required  to break-even  would  be greater  at lower
20
levels  of production.  The extra returns  obtained  from feeding  1.8 and 3.6 
kg of barley  per head daily with silage  are shown  in Table 12 when  barley  
is charged  at £105 per tonne.

Purchase  price £80 per 100 kg
The extra returns  from meal feeding  is the difference  between  that 
obtained  when barley  is fed and that obtained  when silage alone is fed. 
No charge  is made for additional  housing  where  extra cattle are carried  
as a result of meal feeding  because  it is assumed  that adequate  housing  
is available.
Although  feed costs per animal  are £43, £65 and £88 where  0, 1.8 and 
3.6 kg of barley are fed respectively  economic  returns  are improved  in 
all instances  from barley  feeding.  This improvement  in returns  illustrates  
the importance  of the increased  rates of gain obtained  from feeding  
barley. The optimum  level of barley  depends  on the cattle  price increase,  
with 3.6 kg only proving  as economical  as 1.8 kg when  the price increase  
is over £5 per 100 kg. However,  if barley  is charged  at £125 per tonne  
(Table 13) an extremely  high price increase  is required  in order  to justify  
the feeding  of 3.6 kg barley  per animal  daily.
Table 13

10 1579 1245
Purchase  price £80 per 100 kg
This shows  that the cost of barley  becomes  increasingly  important  as the 
level of barley  feeding  is increased.  As interest  charges  are included  in 
the cost of barley and considering  the expected  price for finished  cattle
21
in spring  the optimum  level of barley  will be about 1.8 kg in many  cases.  
It should be noted however  that the above figures  do not include  the 
advantages  expected  from growth  promoters  which  substanially  improve 
returns  in all instances  as shown  in Table 14.

In this table it is assumed  that returns  are improved  by £20 per animal  
as a result  of the growth  promoters.
Conclusions
Apart from cattle price increases  the most important  factors  to con­
sider in obtaining  good returns  from winter  fattening  are :
1. High animal  performance.
2. High yields per acre of high quality  material  as illustrated  by fodder  
beet.
3. Low  cost per unit of feed energy  for purchased  feeds.

The Use of Growth  Promoters  
in Beef Cattle
J. F. ROCHE
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Growth  rate of animals  is affected  by many factors  such as previous  and 
present  plane of nutrition,  sex of animal,  breed,  environment,  season  and 
health  status. Bulls will grow faster than steers,  steers grow faster than 
heifers  and removal  of the ovaries  from heifers  further  depresses  growth  
rate. The effects  of sex on growth  rate are mediated  through  hormonal  
effects.
Because  of the known  effects of hormones  on growth  rate, various  
growth  promoting  implants  have been developed.  These  can be classified 
generally  as follows :
1. Oestrogens —female sex hormone —the manufacture,  preparation,  
packing  or sale of any animal  remedy  containing  oestrogen  to which  
the regulations  apply  is prohibited,  save under  licence  of the Minister  
for Agriculture.  Synovex-S  is the most common  one used in the U.K.  
This product  contains  progesterone  and oestradiol  and it has recently  
become  available  commercially  in Ireland,  through  veterinary  sur­
geons.
2. Androgens —male  sex hormones —these are similar  in action to tes­
tosterone  which is present  in bulls and trenbolone  acetate  (Finaplix)  
is the one most commonly  used.
3. Non-hormonal  compounds— simple  chemicals —affect  growth  rate and 
resorcylic  acid lactone  (Ralgro)  is the most common  one used in this 
category.
The commercially  available  growth  promoters  in Ireland  at present  
are shown  in Table 1.
Side effects
Ralgro  or Finaplix  have shown  no undesirable  side effects  following 
use, such as abnormal  behaviour,  raised  tail head, lactation  in males  etc. 
If Finaplix  was repeatedly  used, it is possible  that some male behavioural  
characteristics  would  develop.  These  two compounds  when used properly  
are safe to animal  and man.
Some side effects  have been reported  on the use of growth  promoters  
containing  oestrogens  (Synovex)  such as increase  in mounting,  riding,  in­
creased  aggression  and raised  tail heads. At time of insertion  of implants,  
it is important  that they are not crushed  or inserted  on wet days because  
there can be a greater  release  rate from the implant  resulting  in worse  
problems.  In addition,  it is important  not to mix implanted  cattle with 
strange  cattle  as this can trigger  off fresh behavioural  problems.

Mechanism  of action
Growth  promoters  generally  increase  tissue growth  and particularly  
muscle  growth  at the expense  of fat. There  appear  to be different  mechan ­
isms of action.
(i) Direct action of the compound  in the target tissue. The hormone  
binds  to a receptor  in the cell, thereby  initiating  a series  of reactions  
which  result in increases  in DNA  synthesis.  Androgens  work in this 
fashion  (Finaplix).
(ii) Indirect  action  on the brain and pituitary  gland  resulting  in increased  
release  of growth  hormone.  Growth  hormone  then acts on target  
tissue as just described  to increase  protein  synthesis.  Ralgro  and 
oestrogens  appear  to work in this manner.
The net result  is an increase  in nitrogen  retention  in the tissue  and a 
decrease  in urinary  excretion  rate of nitrogen. Thus, these com­
pounds  work  more  by increasing  efficiency  of conversion  of food into 
muscle  than by increasing  feed intake.
Use of either  compound  once
It is claimed  that either Ralgro  or Finaplix  will increase  growth  rate 
and feed efficiency  in animals  on pasture  or fed on roughage  and con­
centrate  diets. Experiments  have been carried  out at Grange  and Ballina-  
lack on finishing  steers and results  to date for Ralgro  are summarized  in 
Table 2 and for Finaplix  in Table 3. Ralgro  significantly  increased  the 
mean liveweight  gain. There was variation  in liveweight  gain from trial 
to trial of the order of 0 to 20% increase  with an average  increase  of 
10%. Carcass  weight  was also increased  by a mean  of 7 kg. over controls.

Experiments  with Finaplix  show no significant  increase  in liveweight

14% increase  over controls.  Likewise,  mean  carcass  weight  was increased  
by 6 kg. over controls  in these trials.

Repeated  use of Ralgro
Trials were carried  out to determine  if a second  implant  of Ralgro  
60 days after the first will give a further  increase  in performance.  Five 
hundred  and sixteen  animals  on four farms, mainly  Friesian  X, were 
allocated  to three groups : (1) untreated,  (2) Ralgro  at start of experiment  
and (3) Ralgro  at start and repeated  after 60 days. The minimum  length  
of treatment  on any farm was 130 days.

There  was variation  from farm to farm but from the above  results  in 
Table 4 it does not appear  worthwhile  to re-use Ralgro  60 days after 
the first implantation.  Whether  or not a response  would be obtained  to 
the second  implant  if a longer  interval  was used has not been tested.
Trials were carried  out in the winter  of 1975 on 815 finishing  beef 
steers  fed on silage and concentrates  to determine  if either  implant  alone  
or if both together  would  affect daily liveweight  gain and carcass  weight.  
The animals  were allocated  at random  into four groups :
Group 1; Untreated  controls.
Group  2: Ralgro  given  at start of experiment.
Group  3: Finaplix  given  about  30 days after start of experiment.  
Group  4: Combination  treatment  of Ralgro  initially  followed  by Fina ­
plix in about  30 days.
Animals  were weighed  throughout  the experiment  and the mean and 
daily liveweight  gains are given  in Table  5. Either  growth  promoter  alone  
gave a significant  increase  in growth  rate. The combination  treatment  
gave a further  additive  increase  in growth  rate over either  compound  used 
alone and this was significant.  Carcass  weights  were available  for 596 
animals  on two farms and the mean carcass  weights  for groups 1, 2, 3 
and 4 respectively  were 310 ± 2.05, 319 ± 2.01, 316 ± 2.01 and 328 ± 2.04. 
Animals  on the first farm were slaughtered  after 98 days and after 135 
days on the second  farm. Again  significant  increases  in carcass  weights 
over ‘controls ’ for either compound  were obtained  and the combination  
treatment  gave a further  significant  increase.

Can Ralgro  and Finaplix  be inserted  on the same day ?
A trial was conducted  to determine  whether  it was necessary  when 
using the combination  of Ralgro  and Finaplix  to wait 30 days before
28
inserting  Finaplix.  There were 423 animals  on two farms allocated  at 
random  to 3 groups :
(1) Control  group.
(2) Implanted  with Ralgro  at start of experiment  followed  in about 30 
days by Finaplix.
(3) Implanted  with both Ralgro  and Finaplix  at start of the experiment.  
There  was a significant  (P<0.01)  increase  in final liveweight  and daily
liveweight  gain of steers treated  with growth  promoters  compared  with 
controls  (Table 6). Animals  were slaughtered  after mean duration  of 
132 days. There was also a significant  (P<0.001)  increase  in carcass  
weight  of treated  steers  compared  with controls.  There  was no difference 
in final liveweight  gain or carcass  weight  for steers receiving  both com­
pounds  on the same or different  days. Thus, both compounds  can be 
inserted  on the same day and still get the same effect as inserting  them  
30 days apart.

Repeated  use of Ralgro  and Finaplix
A trial was carried  out to determine  if re-implanting  steers  65-70  days 
later with Ralgro  and Finaplix  further  increased  growth  rate compared  
to steers  given the combination  treatment  once. There  were 453 animals  
on three farms  allocated  at random  to three  groups :
(i) Control.
(ii) Implanted  with Ralgro  and Finaplix  at start of experiment.
(iii) Implanted  with Ralgro  and Finaplix  at start of experiment  and re­
implanted  with Ralgro  and Finaplix  65-70  days later.
Re-implantation  65-70  days after initial implantation  significantly  in­
creased  final liveweight,  daily liveweight  gain and carcass  weight  com­
pared to steers given the combination  treatment  once (Table 7). This 
treatment  should  only be considered  where  animals  are being kept for at 
least 130 days and are on a high plane of nutrition  from start of treat ­
ment.

Effectiveness  at pasture
The purpose  of the next experiment  was to determine  whether  results 
being achieved  on silage and concentrates  over the winter  months  could 
be obtained  when animals  were on pasture.  At the start of the experi ­
ment,  all implants  were inserted  into the base of the ear.
Either growth promoter  when used alone significantly  (P <; 0.05)  
increased  final liveweight  and daily liveweight  gain (Table  8). Resorcylic  
acid significantly  (P < 0.01) increased  carcass  weight but trenbolone  
acetate  did not. The reason  for this discrepancy  is not clear. The use of 
both growth  promoters  again gave significant  (P<0.01)  increase  in final 
liveweight,  daily liveweight  gain and carcass  weight  compared  either  with 
both compounds  used alone or compared  with performance  of control  
steers.

In contrast  to the results  in steers,  the results  in heifers  or cull cows  
are not as clear and can be summarized  as follows :
(1) Marginal  response  obtained.

(2) Ralgro  and Finaplix  not additive.
(3) Finaplix  is the implant  recommended.
(4) Monensin  could  also be considered  for use as a feed additive.
Use in calves  and weanlings
Ralgro  is the growth  promoter  one would consider  using in calves. 
Two trials have been carried  out to date in uncastrated  calves  from 3-5 
months  of age. Calves  in Trial 1 were Friesian  bull calves  while  those in 
Trial 2 were multiple  suckled  Friesian  or Charolais  cross animals. The 
liveweight  gain of control  and Ralgro  treated  animals  respectively  were
57.5 ± 1.9, 60.9 ± 1.9 in Trial 1 and 89.7 + 1.9 and 86.6 ± 1.9 in Trial 2. 
No increase  in daily liveweight  gain was obtained  in these  trials  with bull 
calves. However,  in other trials with steer calves  we have got a 10-15%  
increase  in growth  rate in calves varying  in age from ten days to four 
months.

One trial has been carried out in Ballinalack  on 8-9 month old 
Friesian  bulls with Ralgro. Animals  were allocated  at random  to two 
groups  of 26 each : (1) untreated  control  and (2) treated  with Ralgro.  
The initial and final liveweights  after 88 days were 189 and 222 kg. for 
control  weanlings  and 191 and 225 kg. for weanlings  given Ralgro.  From  
these limited  trials with uncastrated  calves or weanlings,  no effect of 
Ralgro  on liveweight  gain was obtained.
Feed intake
Experiments  have been carried  out in Grange  to determine  whether  
implanted  steers have a parallel  increase  in feed intake in relation  to 
increased  level of weight  gain. Either  Ralgro  or Ralgro  + Finaplix  in­
creased  feed intake by 2-4%. Thus, growth  promoters  work mainly  by 
increasing  conversion  of feed into meat.
31
Carcass  composition
The results of commercial  vacuum  pack cutting  for estimating  the 
weights  of lean meat, fat trim and bone are shown in Table 9. The 
increase  in carcass  weight  following  Ralgro  and Finaplix  is mainly  lean 
meat, a result similar  to that in bulls. In contrast,  there is the normal  
increase  in fat and lean in the carcass  following  Romensin,  a situation  
comparable  to that in steers  given more energy.
Possible  combinations  to use
In steers  the following  combinations  can be used ;
1. Female  + male growth  promoters:  the two are additive  for example,  
Ralgro  + Finaplix,  Synovex  + Finaplix.
2. A growth  promoter  + feed additive : the two are additive  for example,  
Ralgro  + Romensin,  Synovex  + Romensin.
3. Fernale  + male growth  promoter  + feed additive : the three are not 
additive  to date, for example,  Ralgro  + Finaplix  + Romensin.
In female  cattle Relgro  + Finaplix  are not additive;  use either Fina ­
plix or Romensin.
Factors  affecting  response  to growth  promoters
Response  is affected  by plane of nutrition  and animals  should be 
gaining  at least 0.5 kg per day in order to get a good response  from 
growth  promoters.  Where  animals  gained  less than 6.25 kg. per day, the 
response  was very poor. Therefore,  growth  promoters  can be used on 
finishing  cattle fed on good quality  silage  and concentrates  or in animals  
turned  out to grass from April to July. MFC  results  from the U.K. indi­
cate that the best growth  responses  were obtained  in animals  which  were 
implanted  at turnout  to grass in spring. Response  is also affected  by sex; 
it is clear from the data that steers show larger  responses  than heifers  or 
cull cows. It is also clear that in order to achieve  maximum  response  
cattle must be free of endo and ectoparasites.
Residues  of growth  promoters
Many  of the anabolic  compounds  used in animal  production  have the 
effect of altering  the levels  of the natural  growth  hormones  in the animal.  
Natural  hormones  are safe to use provided  that levels in blood  and tissue 
do not exceed  the normal  levels found under a variety  of physiological 
situations.
Synovex-S  implants  increased  the levels of oestradiol  17 beta in 
plasma  after implantation.  Levels  were still raised  60 days after implan ­
tation but by 120 days the levels were similar  to that in non-implanted  
steers. Finaplix  residues  of trenbolone  acetate  have been found in vari­
ous tissues  63 days after implantation  in amounts  similar  or lower than 
normal  levels of testosterone  in bulls. Ralgro  is absorbed  slowly at a 
fairly*  constant  rate from the implants.  Using  tritium  labelled  resorcylic 
acid safe amounts  of residues  were found  in muscle,  liver, kidney  and fat 
65 days after implantation.
32
Limitations
1. Animals  must not be slaughtered  for 60-65 days after implantation  in 
order  to ensure  that residues  are low or undetectable  in meat.
2. Breeding  males or females  must not be treated  with hormonal  type 
growth  promoters.
3. Insert implants  in the ear only as there is a residual  amount  of com­
pound  at the site of implantation  for many months.  Since the ear is 
disposed  of, this does not create  any hazard.
4. There  is variation  from farm to farm in response  obtained.
5. Fluctuations  in beef prices  should  be borne  in mind when deciding  to 
use implants.  If beef prices  suddenly  decline  treated  cattle  should  not 
be sold until the recommended  withdrawal  period  has elapsed.
The Ralgro  + Finaplik  combination  is effective  for about 120-130  
days. Thereafter,  the animals  will gain weight  at the normal  rate. The 
only limitation  on date of slaughter  is to ensure  that the recommended  
withdrawal  period  has elapsed.
Conclusions
Growth  promoters  produce  an economic  response  in steers but they 
must be used properly.  In finishing  beef cattle the use of growth  pro­
moters  is one effective  way to improve  profitability.  Thus, every effort  
must be made to ensure  that this aid remains  available  to beef producers  
by proper  use of the compounds.

Recent  Developments  in 
Dairy  Cow Nutrition
P. A. GLEESON
The Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark,  Fernioy,  Co. Cork.
The major ingredients  of the dairy cow ’s diet are grass (60%),  silage  
(30%)  and concentrates  (10%).  The importance  of silage  quality,  quantity  
and good preservation  was discussed  by the author  in this Journal  in 
1978, Volume  13, page 65. This paper describes  in more detail the use 
of concentrates  in the diet of the dairy cow. In addition  the age and 
weight  at first calving  of heifers  are discussed.
Energy  content  of the diet
Presently  many feeds for ruminants  are expressed  as Mega Joules  
(M.J.)  of Metabolisable  Energy  (M.E.)  per kilogram  of dry matter. From  
these values  the energy  content  of the diet can be determined.  Most pub­
lications  only contain  a mean value of the individual  feed ingredients.  
However,  great variations  can occur.
The energy  value of the formulated  diet is influenced  by the oil con­
tent, fibre level, ash and dry matter  content  of the ration. High fibre 
values  will reduce  the feeding  value as will high levels  of ash and mois ­
ture in the diet. Increasing  the oil level will tend to increase  the energy 
value of the ration. Fats or oils contain  a high gross energy level 
(approximately  39 M.J./kg)  as compared  with protein  or carbohydrate  
(approximately  17.1 M.J./kg)  and the feeding  of fat or oil is a potential  
method  of increasing  energy  intake. High energy  diets are essential  for 
high yielding  cows in early lactation  due to their low intake  capacity  at 
this time. Fat or oils can be fed in either  protected  or unprotected  form. 
The purpose  of protecting  the fat is to reduce  the breakdown  of fat in the 
rumen. The protection  is achieved  by encapsulating  the fat droplet  in a 
layer  of aldehyde  treated  protein.  The research  findings  on feeding  unnro-  
tected fat are variable.  In general  data suggest  that with roughage  diets  
the effect of high inclusion  of fat in the diet does not give increased  
output  of milk.
The effect  of tallow  added  to a concentrate  diet was studied  at Moore ­
park. A preparation  containing  tallow  and protein  (75 :25) was prepared  
as a fine mix and a ration  formulated  to contain  9% oil in the concen ­
trate was compared  with a control  ration  containing  3.75%  oil.
Thirty  spring  calving  cows were fed al libitum  silage plus 7.25 kg of 
a 16% protein  ration for a three week preliminary  period  after calving 
and were then assigned  to either  of three treatments  for an eight week  
experimental  period  as follows :
(1) Ad libitum  silage plus 7.25 kg of dairy ration ( 18% CP) normal  
energy.
35
(2) Ad libitum  silage plus 7.25 kg of dairy ration  (18% CP) including 
added  fat (high energy).
(3) Ad libitum  silage plus 6.6 kg of dairy ration (18% CP) including 
added fat but energy  intake of the concentrate  is equalised  to the 
level of treatment  1. The composition  of the dairy rations  are shown 
in Table 1 and the chemical  composition  in Table  2.

Energy  concentration  (M.J./kg  DM) 12.8 13.8
Both rations  were of good quality,  low in fibre and ash and high in dry 
matter  concentration.  The energy  density  of both rations  was high 11 5 
M.J./kg  as fed for the control  and 12.5 M.J./kg  for the high energy  
ration.
The results  are presented  in Table 3. Group  A, receiving  7.25 kg of 
the control  ration,  had a similar  performance  to Group  C, receiving  6.60 
kg of the high energy  ration,  in milk yield,  fat yield,  protein  yield,  fat %, 
protein  % and liveweight  changes.  Group  B receiving  7.25 kg of the high 
energy  ration produced  significantly  more milk than Group  C and also 
more fat and protein.  There  was no significant  difference  between  A and
36
B in any of the parameters  measured.  A digestibility  trial was carried  
out in conjunction  with the experiment  but there were no differences  in 
the digestibility  of the dry matter,  energy  or fibre on any of the 3 diets.

The results  of this trial would not justify  the inclusion  of tallow  at 
high levels in dairy rations  to increase  energy  density.  It must be noted  
that the control  ration  was of high quality  and possibly  greater  dilTerences  
might  occur if this were not so. The results  emphasize  that it is possible  
to formulate  high quality  rations  with normal  ingredients,  available  to 
the compounding  industry  without  resorting  to the inclusion  of high fat 
levels in the diet which may cause digestive  upsets  and reduced  digesti ­
bility of the diet. The form of the added  fat or oil may also be important  
but the best responses  obtained  from the addition  of high levels  of fat or 
oil in the diet is when they are protected  by the addition  of aldehyde  
treated  protein  to encapsulate  the fat droplets.
The protein  content  of dairy rations
The two major components  in concentrate  rations  are energy and 
protein,  but minerals  and vitamins  are also included.  There  is little criti­
cal information  available  on nutritive  value of silage protein  and on 
protein  supplementation  of grass silage. In many silages,  50% of the 
crude protein  is composed  of non-protein  nitrogen.  Under  such circum ­
stances,  although  the crude  protein  intake  of the cow maybe  theoretically  
adequate,  there maybe  a response  to additional  protein.  In two feeding 
trials at Moorepark  involving  180 individually  fed cows, the effect of 
varying  the protein  content  of the concentrate  was examined  with average  
and poor quality  silage  as the basal feeds. Concentrates  were formulated  
to contain  three levels of protein  (12, 15 and 18%) and were fed at 3.0,
5.5 and 8.0 kg per day to nine groups  of cows with each silage. The 
concentrates  were composed  of barley  and soyabean,  and contained  2% 
mineral  vitamin  mixture.  The experimental  feeding  period  in early lac­
tation was eight weeks,  and cows then uniformally  treated  on pasture  
for 12 weeks. In Table  4 the milk yields  for the eight week experimental  
period  and for the period 1-20 weeks are presented  and in addition  the
37
margins  over concentrate  costs are also shown. The price of the con­
centrates  was adjusted  in relation  to the crude protein  concentrations  in 
the diet. The results  indicate  that there is little response  to protein  at the 
low level of feeding.  However,  when the feeding  levels increased  to the
5.5 and 8 kg per day there was a response  in all cases from 12 to 15% 
crude protein  and only at the higher  feeding  levels was there a response 
from going  from 15 to 18% crude  protein.  The results  presented  in Table  
4 are data from one of the silages  fed in this experiment.  When  the results  
of both experiments  are examined  it is concluded  that a feeding  level of 
7 kg a day at 16% crude protein  is the most economic  at the present  
feed price-milk  ratio. However,  if feeding  levels exceed 8 kg a day 
it maybe  beneficial  to Increase  the level of protein  to 18%. The data 
further  suggest,  particularly  in the eight week experimental  period,  an 
inter-changeability  between  energy  and protein.  This is illustrated  when 
the feeding  level of 5.5 kg per day at 18% crude  protein  is compared  with 
the 8 kg feeding  level at 12% protein  where  similar  milk production  was 
obtained  for both groups. This result occured  in both experiments.  The 
protein  content  of a concentrate  had no effect on silage intake. As the 
level of concentrate  feeding  increased  the intake  of silage  was significantly 
decreased.  Liveweight  changes  during  the eight week experimental  period 
reflected  the level of feeding  with greater  body weight  loss occuring  at 
the lower  feeding  levels. Milk fat and milk protein  percentages  were not 
affected  by the level of protein  in the concentrate.  As would  be expected,  
milk protein  percentage  increased  with the level of concentrate  feeding.

Flat versus  variable  feeding
levels  of concentrates  to spring  calving  dairy cows
There  is much  discussion  at the present  time on the methods  of feed­
ing concentrates  to dairy cows. This mainly  arises from the higher  milk
38
yields presently  been obtained  on many dairy farms. Many people  con­
clude  that with higher  yields  it is necessary  to allocate  the concentrates  in 
relation  to yield. This has resulted  in the installation  of feeders  into many  
milking  parlours  to allow allocation  of concentrates  in relation  to yield.  
The inclusion  of feeders  in parlours  may be for the purpose  of overcom ­
ing the problems  of handling  large quantities  of concentrates  for dairy  
herds. An experiment  has been carried  out at Moorepark  comparing  the 
feeding  of fixed levels of concentrates  to lactating  cows with varying 
concentrate  feeding  levels in relation  to yields. One group of cows was 
fed 7.3 kg of concentrates  per cow per day for an eight week period  while 
a second group was fed the same total quantity  of concentrates  but 
allocated  to each cow in proportion  to her yield. The milk yields of the 
cows in each group  varied  between  3^ to 6 gallons  at the initiation  of the 
experiment.  The results  of the experiment  are presented  in Table 5.
Table 5

Milk protein % 3.10 3.08
Silage dry matter  intake as percent  of 
bodyweight 1.61 1.40
Liveweight  change  (kg/day) 0.06 -0.32
The results indicate  that there was no significant  difference  in milk 
yields or milk composition  for either treatment.  It can be concluded  
from this experiment  that provided  there is no undue competition  for 
concentrates  at the feeding  trough  there is no nutritional  justification  for 
including  expensive  methods  of feeding  in dairy farming.  Close  examina ­
tion of the data show that those cows on the variable  feeding  rate receiv ­
ing the higher  levels of feed reduced  their silage intake as the level of 
concentrates  increased,  and similarly  those on the lower feeding  levels  
tended  to eat more silage.
Age and weight  at first calving
Due to the seasonal  calving  nature  of the Irish Dairy  Industry  heifers 
entering  the dairy herd calve at two or three years of age. The effect of 
both age and weight  at first calving  is being studied  at the Agricultural  
Institute  Field Station,  Ballyragget,  Co. Kilkenny.  Friesian  spring  calving  
heifers  have been divided  into four treatment  groups  to compare  the effect  
of weight  at first calving  on lactation  performance.  Two groups  had a
39
target weight  of 450 kg weight  before  calving  and were stocked  at 0.95 
and 0.75 acres per animal  after calving.  The other  two groups  were also 
stocked  at 0.95 or 0.75 and had a target  weight  of 525 kg before  calving.  
These  stocking  rates provide  grazing  and silage  requirements.  Three  year 
old calving  heifers  were also stocked  at either  0.95 and 0.75 animals  per 
acre and had a pre-calving  weight  of 565 kg. The two year old calvers 
completed  three lactations  by the end of 1978 and the three year olds 
have completed  two lactations.  For ease of presentation  the stocking  rate 
groups  are combined  and the results  are summarised  in Table  6.

In the first lactation  the two year olds weighing  525 kg produced  sub­
stantially  more milk than two year olds calving  at 450 kg. During  the 
summer  and autumn  of 1976 feed supplies  were scarce  and these animals  
had little opportunity  to gain weight  between  the first and second  lacta ­
tions, and their pre-calving  weight  in 1977 differed  very little from their  
pre-calving  weight  in 1976. This resulted  in a disappointing  milk perfor ­
mance  during 1977. However  during  that period  the animals  increased  
substantially  in body-weight  as indicated  by their pre-calving  weight  at 
the start of 1978. The milk production  performance  in 1978 increased  
substantially  over the 1977 figures. To date the heavier  two year old 
calvers  have over a 100 gallons  more milk produced  at the end of the 
third lactation.  Delaying  calving  to three years of age did not greatly  
improve  the milk lactation  performance  in the first lactation.  Modest  
milk increases  between  first and second  lactation  were recorded  for these  
three year old calving  heifers  even though  they did increase  in weight 
between  first and second  lactations.  The two and three year old calvers 
were born in the same year but the milk production  at the end of 1978 
shows  that the three year old calvers  have 600 gallons  less milk produced  
than the two year calvers  to date. The early indications  are that two year 
olds at the heavier  weights  (525 kg) have a lower  culling  rate than either
40
of the other two groups. While this experiment  is still in progress  one 
could  indicate  that the pre-calving  target  weight  for heifers  should  be over 
500 kg calving  at two years and there is little advantage  to be gained  in 
delaying  calving  to three years of age if the heifers  are welt grown  as two 
year olds.
The effect  of level of concentrate  feeding  to dairy cows  
on a whole  farm system  basis
An experiment  to study the effect of pre- and post-calving  feeding 
levels  of concentrates  to dairy cows on a whole  farm system  basis is pre­
sently in progress  at the Agricultural  Institute  Field Station,  Solohead,  
Co. Tipperary.  There are four treatment  groups : herds A and B are 
stocked  at 1.17 acres per cow and herds  C and D at 0.96 acres per cow. 
Herds  A and C are fed 2.7 kg of concentrates  daily to all heifers  and first 
lactation  animals  in the prepartum  feeding  period. Post-calving  feeding  
levels for these groups  amount  to 5.5 kg of concentrates  daily to all ani­
mals from calving  until March  31st; and 2.7 kg thereafter  until the middle  
of May. All cows in herds B and D are fed 2.7 kg of concentrates  per 
day in the pre-calving  period  which  commences  in late November.  These  
two groups  of cows are fed 9 kg of concentrates  post-calving  until March  
31st and are then reduced  to 4.5 kg daily until the middle  of May. The 
first years results  (1978)  are presented  in Table  7.

The low meal groups  A and C were fed less than 500 kg of the con­
centrates  per cow and the high meal feeding  groups  B and D had an 
intake  of 860 kg and 750 kg of concentrates  respectively.  There  was no 
response  to increased  concentrate  feeding  levels at the low stocking  rate 
and there was an advantage  of 43 gallons  at the higher  stocking  rates.  
When one studies  the margin  over concentrates  there was no economic  
advantage  to feeding  the higher  levels  of feeding  at either  the low or high 
stocking  rates. This is the first year of this experiment  and therefore  the 
results  must be treated  with caution  but they do indicate  that care must  
be taken that excessive  amounts  of concentrates  are not fed to spring  
calving  cows resulting  in reduced  profitability  on the farm.
41
A similar  type of experiment  is in progress  at Moorepark  where  the 
concentrate  feeding  levels post-calving  over the entire  grazing  season  are 
being studied. The experiment  involves  four experimental  groups;  
Groups  A and B are stocked  at 1 cow per acre for the entire season 
and C and D are stocked  at 0.8 acres per cow. Groups  A and C are 
fed the lower levels of concentrates  approximately  500 kg per cow 
and Group  D and B are fed higher  concentrate  feeding  levels amount ­
ing to approximately  one tonne over the total lactations.  Groups  A 
and C are fed 7.3 kg of concentrates  per day post-calving  until the 
middle  of April when meal feeding  ceases with the exception  of 0.5 
kg of concentrates  to carry calcined  magnesite  until the end of May. 
No concentrates  were fed in the pre-calving  period,  with the excep ­
tion of the in-calf heifers. Groups B and D were fed 7.3 kg of 
concentrates  from calving  until the mid May when concentrate  feeding 
ceased. From early July until mid August  supplementary  feeding  at the 
rate of 3.2 kg a day was introduced  to groups  B and D as milk yields  
were declining  at over 2\% per week at this period.  Concentrates  were 
introduced  to both B and D in early September  at the rate of 3.2 kg of 
concentrates  per day until drying  off in mid-November.  This experiment  
then allows  a comparison  of more normal  management  groups,  A and C 
with groups  B and D where  higher  inputs  of concentrates  are fed to over­
come possible  feed deficits  during  the mid summer  period  and at the end 
of the grazing  season  where  herbage  availability  is declining.  The results  
for 1978 are presented  in Table  8,

The feeding  of an additional  500 kg of concentrates  resulted  in in­
creased  milk output  of over 100 gallons  for both stocking  rates, resulting  
in a response  of 1 kg of extra milk/kg  of concentrates  fed for both stock ­
ing rates. At present  concentrate  prices (£130) ton) this would not be 
economical.  However  if cheaper  feed ingredients  were available  there  
maybe some economic  justification  of higher levels. In Table 9 the 
responses  to the additional  meals over the different  periods  in the lacta ­
tion are shown. They indicate  clearly  that the continuation  of concen ­
trates from mid April to mid May gave a very poor response  in milk
42
yield. Better  responses  were obtained  to mid lactation  and late lactation  
feeding. But again the feeding  levels are not economically  justified  at 
concentrates  costing  between  £125 and £130 a ton.

This experiment  is also in its first year and it is not possible  to make  
definite  conclusions  on the feeding  of the additional  concentrates  particu ­
larly during  the mid and late lactation  periods. Half of the animals  in 
this experiment  were in their first lactation.
Cull cows
Data from a cull cow nutrition  experiment  at Moorepark  were used 
to demonstrate  the effect of level of nutrition  and body condition  on ani­
mal performance.  The object was to provide  information  on liveweight  
gains attainable  by cull cows and to determine  the economics  of over­
wintering  them. It was possible  during  the trial to examine  the effect of 
condition  and to relate  condition  changes  to liveweight.
Thirty-five  non-pregnant  cull cows from spring-calving  herds were 
assembled  and divided  on the basis of body condition  into high and low
43
score groups. These groups  were fed moderate  quality  silage and con­
centrates  as follows :
High score —ad libitum  silage.
High score —ad libitum  silage + 4 kg concentrates  daily.
Low score —ad libitum  silage.
Low score —ad libitum  silage + 4 kg concentrates  daily.
The trial lasted  92 days (7/11/77  to 9/2/78).  The concentrates  used con­
tained 16% crude protein;  silage intakes  were measured.  At the end of 
the trial the animals  were slaughtered  and six carcasses  from each group  
were divided  into muscle,  fat and bone components.  Performance  and 
carcass  disection  data are given in Tables  10 and 11, respectively.

All groups  increased  liveweight  during  the trial. Low score animals  
had a slightly  higher  rate of gain and consumed  an extra 0.4 tons of silage  
per animal.  There  was a good liveweight  response  to concentrate  feeding 
and rate of gain for these  cows was double  that of the silage  only groups. 
They consumed  less silage,  substituting  concentrates  for silage  at the rate 
of 1 kg concentrate  dry matter  for 0.4 kg silage dry matter. All groups  
improved  condition  and attained  good scores within the 92 days.
The low score groups  had lower killing-out  percentages;  they had 
lighter  carcasses  and csonsequently  a lower total yield of lean meat, fat 
and bone (Table  11).
Carcasses  from high score cows yielded  more lean meat but also gave 
much greater  yields of fat. This was especially  true for the concentrate  
fed group.

Modern  Milking
J. O’SHEA
Agricultural  Institute.  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
This review of modern  milking  requires  some definition  of the term  
“modern ”. A survey  of milking  practices  and equipment  in Ireland  was 
carried  out in 1960 and the results  of that survey  provided  the impetus  
for subsequent  milking  research. For the first time, research  reports  
named the makes of equipment.  Previously,  components  which were 
tested  in Research  Institutes  were identified  only by code numbers.
Table 1 shows the percentage  of the herds of different  sizes which 
were milked  in different  types of sheds  and the milking  rates of the herds. 
The outstanding  feature  of the data was the low number  of cows milked  
per man per hour.

Table 2 shows that a large percentage  of herds which had milking 
machines  were hand-milked  for part of the year. Ten per cent of the 
farmers  in the survey  had reverted  to hand-milking  from machine  milk ­
ing. Their  reasons  for this decision  are given in Table  3.

Present  situation
In 1979 it is not unusual  to find milkers  milking  70 cows per man per 
hour with a low incidence  of mechanical  faults, low levels of mastitis  
and producing  milk of high bacterialogical  quality. What has happened  
in the meantime  to cause  these changes?
After the 1960 survey studies  were commenced  on seven aspects  of 
milking  and milking  equipment;  the activities  were highly inter-related  
and are separated  only for convenience.  Similar  activities  have also been 
initiated  in some other Institutes  and milking  machine  manufacturers  
have also played a major role in the developments.  The inter-related  
studies  sought  to improve :
(1) Mechanical  efficiency  of milking  equipment.
(2) The adverse  effect of milking  machine  on infection.
(3) The standard  of installation  on farms.
(4) Maintenance  standards  of farms.
(5) Cleaning  of equipment  on farms.
(6) Milking  shed design.
(7) Number  of cows milked  per man per hour.
Performance  tests
To ensure  durable  and properly  functioning  milking  equipment,  milk ­
ing machines  and components  were tested under controlled  conditions  
and reports  were issued on their performaice.  This resulted  in a major  
improvement  in the quality  of components  on the market  (Table  4).
The improvement  in performance  indicated  by Table  4 underestimates  
the actual improvement  because  the standards  were being  raised  as years 
progressed.  Manufacturers  have generally  replaced  faulty components  
by satisfactory  components  from other manufacturers  until they had 
sufficiently  improved  their own components.  By way of comparison,  the

Machine  milking  and mastitis
Several experiments  in Moorepark  show the relationship between
irregular  vacuum fluctuations  and increased new infections  (Table 6).

Larger vacuum  pumps and pipes are now being installed  to improve  
vacuum  stability  and in response  to higher  reserves  vacuum  regulators  
have higher  capacities  and greater  sensitivity.
More recent  results  have shown  a relationship  between  liner slip and 
high new infection  rates (Table  7).

Manufacturers  are now trying  to improve  the stability  of the liners on 
cows ’ teats to reduce  the risk of infection  and to minimize  the disruption  
to milk incurred  by slips and fall offs.
Standard  of installation
Milking  machines  will be properly  installed  if farmers  request  that 
machines  are installed  to the Irish standard  IS 187 and get a written  
agreement  from the installer  that the machine  will be so installed.
Maintenance
Installers  generally  provide  a routine  maintenance  chart. Farmers  
should  follow  these instructions.  Technicians  have been trained  at Moore ­
park and more recently  in the Regional  Technical  Colleges  for testing  of 
milking  machines.  Every machine  should  be tested at least once a year 
by such a trained  technician  and his recommendations  should be fol­
lowed. There is evidence  that faults develop  on milking  machines  on 
many  farms  due to bad maintenance  (Table  8).

Cleaning  of milking  machines
Cleaning  problems  are minimal  in properly  installed  machines.  Simple 
cheap methods  of cleaning  have been developed  and have proven  very 
satisfactory.  Ease of cleaning  is monitored  during  performance  tests on 
components.
Milking  shed design
A booklet  on milking  shed design  is available  from The Agricultural  
Institute.  Milking  sheds should  have pipelines  rather  than recorder  jars. 
Herring  bone sheds should have two stalls per unit; sheds should  not 
generally  have feeders  or automatic  cluster  removers.  To record  yields 
milk meters can be used at 3 - 5 week intervals  for recording  yields.  
Double-up  parlours  (1 stall per unit) are only 60% as efficient  (cows  
milked  per unit per hour)  as two stall per unit plants.
Automatic  cluster  removers  were originally  designed  to prevent  in­
creased  mastitis  due to over-milking.  However,  there was no evidence 
available  to suggest  that over-milking  increased  mastitis.  The effect of 
cluster  removers  on herd milking  rates in a New Zealand  survey  was 
variable.  There  was an increase  in output  of up to 25% in milking  rate 
where  milkers  had corrected  wrong  routines  (spending  a lot of time trying  
to avoid over-milking).  At the other  end of the scale there was a depres ­
sion of up to 8% in output  due to using automatic  cluster  removers.
Throughput  of cows
The number  of cows milked  per man per hour will largely  be deter ­
mined by the number  of units handled  and this in turn will be deter ­
mined by the milking  shed design and properly  functioning  milking  
equipment  which  needs  no alterations  during  milking.  Machine  stripping  
can be omitted  with clusters  which have low strip yields and this will 
allow more units to be used.
Ancillary  equipment
As the duration  of machine  milking  is reduced,  the ancillary  activities  
such as yard-washing,  cleaning  of the milking  machine,  etc., are becoming 
a greater  percentage  of total time spent in the milking  shed. Conse ­
quently,  increased  attention  is being given at Moorepark  to ancillary  
equipment  such as different  types of in-parlour  feeding  automatic  cluster  
removers,  automatic  recorder  jar emptying,  yard-washing  and stand-by  
generators.
Electronics
In the past few years there has been a continuing  proliferation  of elec­
tronic equipment  for performing  various  functions  in milking  machines.  
Whilst  some of the future  improvements  in milking  equipment  will be by 
means  of electronic  devices,  not many advantages  have yet been proved.  
Manufacturers  should be required  to conduct  adequate  testing  of new 
equipment  or ideas before  they are sold to the consumer.  Farmers  should
53
be aware  of those features  which  are fashions  and those which  are neces ­
sities.
Summary
1. Performance  testing  ensures  that milking  equipment  available  to Irish 
farmers  is as good as is available  anywhere  in the world.
Machines  will be properly  installed  if specified  to IS 187.
Maintenance  on farms and a yearly  test by a technician  is essential. 
Milking  shed design  should  be simple  and proliferation  of equipment  
which  serves  no useful  purpose  should  be avoided.
Up to 70 cows per man per hour can be milked  in simple  milking 
sheds with good simple  milking  equipment.

This paper examines  a few possible  constraints  and questions  that arise 
from continued  growth  in milk output  in Ireland.  As the economic  condi ­
tions under  which  further growth  in output  might  take place  will be deter ­
mined mainly  by decisions  in Brussels,  a few comments  on the E.E.C.  
Commissions  proposals  are appropriate.
E.E.C.  Commission  Proposals
principle,  namely, that any measures  applied should be common  
measures  applying  throughout  the Community  so that Irish producers  are 
maintained  in a similar  competitive  position  with producers  elsewhere  in 
the Community.  This is the central  principle  of the Common  Agricul ­
tural Policy. The underlying  theory  is that under a system  of common  
measures  production  will tend to locate  itself in the regions  best suited  to 
it. The favourable  consequences  of this principle  for Irish milk produc ­
tion over the past six years are clear from Fig. 1. The relative  growth  
rates in milk supply  of the different  countries  strongly  suggest  that even
if Community  production  is no longer  to expand  into the future,  Irish  
production  can still expand  considerably,  so long as the principle  of 
common  measures  applying  throughout  the Community  is preserved.  But 
the introduction  of special  measures  to be applied  on a regional  or a sup­
plier basis, resulting  in regions  or suppliers  with a higher  output  growth  
paying  higher  penalties,  would be contrary  to the Common  Agricultural  
Policy,  and would  mean that a common  policy  for milk would  no longer  
exist.
Future  milk output  in Ireland
If milk output  continues  to increase,  will further  supplies  come from  
increased  yields or greater  cow numbers?  Study of past performance  
(Fig. 2) shows  that :
(i) In the decade  before  E.E.C.  membership  1963-1973,  creamery  milk 
output  increased  by nearly  67%; two thirds  of this increase  was due 
to increased  cow numbers  and one third was due to increased  yield.
(ii) Since E.E.C. membership  in 1973 creamery  output increased  by 
42%. However,  almost  two thirds of this increase  was due to in­
creased  yield,  with only one third due to greater  cow numbers  (Table
1). Yields  at present  are estimated  at 650 gals, per cow on average  
and have increased  by about 140 gals, on average  since E.E.C.  mem ­
bership  in 1973.

Milk yield
Let us consider  the factors which contributed  to increased  yields.  
Meal feeding  levels increased  from 4| cwts. per cow in 1973/74  to about  
9J cwts. per cow in 1978 and milk yields  increased  by 140 gals, per cow 
in this period  (Table  2). How much have meals  contributed  to increased  
yields? It depends  on making  an assumption  on the response  from in­
creased  meal feeding. Assuming  7 lbs. meals/gal.,  it is estimated  that 
about 78 gals, was produced  from extra meals. On this basis about  half 
of the 140 gal. increase  was therefore  due to other factors,  i.e., improved  
husbandry  and breeding,  better grassland  management,  more selective 
culling,  earlier  calving,  etc. The increase  in meal feeding  has been associ ­
ated with a more favourable  milk to meals  price ratio (Table  2).

' Preliminary  estimate

In the future  it is unlikely  that the milk/meal  price ratio will become 
more favourable.  Hence,  further  yield increases  will depend  more on the 
other aspects  of dairy husbandry  as listed above.
Cow numbers
In discussing  growth  in cow numbers  it is more relevant  to consider  
total cows rather than the creamery  herd only. One of the surprising  
aspects  of E.E.C.  membership  to date is that total cow numbers  have 
remained  static. While creamery  cow numbers  have grown,  this growth  
has merely  replaced  the fall in beef cow numbers,  and from the latest  
figures  close to zero growth  will be true for 1979 also. In contrast,  there  
was a steady  growth  of about 3% per annum  in total cow numbers  in 
the decade  prior to E.E.C.  membership  (Fig. 3).
In explaining  the lack of growth  in total cow numbers  since 1973, the 
cattle crisis in 1973/74  is of foremost  consideration.  However,  there are 
other  factors  which  merit  discussion ;
1. the culling  rate, as a percentage  of the total cow herd;
2. the replacement  rate, as a percentage  of the total cow herd.
By definition  if the inflow  of heifers  or the replacement  rate is greater  
than the culling  rate, the herd increases  in sizes.
In general,  up to 1973 the culling  rate averaged  17% and the replace-  
rate was 20%. Hence,  growth  in the total cow herd was 3% per annum.  
The culling  rate fluctuates  much more widely  as can be seen from Fig. 4, 
between  the extremes  of 12-25%,  compared  with a very steady  replace ­
ment rate. The periods  of rapid  growth,  1963 - 1965 and 1970 - 1973 were 
associated  mainly  with a large drop in the culling  rate.

Since 1973 the culling  rate has moved  on average  to about 20%. the 
replacement  rate has remained  at 20% with the result  that there has been 
no growth  at all in the total herd. The points  arising  with regard  to future  
herd growth  are :
1. Has the culling  rate now moved  permanently  to a higher  level of 20% 
and will it possibly  move even higher  over the next few years due to 
the disease  eradication  programme?
2. If (1) is accepted  then there can be no herd growth  until the replace ­
ment rate moves  towards  25% of the herd, i.e. proportionately  more 
heifers  would  need to be directed  for breeding,  and fewer for beef.
Heifers  for breeding  or beef
The breakdown  of the utilisation  of heifers  as between  breeding  and 
beef in recent years provides  some interesting  insights.  From approxi ­
mately  2 million  cows over 800,000  maiden  heifers  are utilised  each year 
either  for breeding  or for beef production.  A breakdown  of heifer  utilisa ­
tion for the past five years shows very consistently  that about 45% of 
maiden  heifers  were utilised  for breeding  and about 55% for beef (Table  
3). The 45% for breeding  corresponds  to the 20% replacement  rate in 
the cow herd outlined  earlier. Now if the replacement  rate is to move  
towards  25% of the cow herd to provide  cow herd growth  in the future,  
then the breakdown  in the utilisation  of maiden  heifers  must be reversed.

For beef as % of total 54.2 56.8 54.2 54.1 53.6
' Perliminary  estimate
In Other  words.  55 -60%  of maiden  heifers  must be allocated  to breeding, 
leaving  40-45%  for beef production.  This change  in the utilisation  of 
heifers would firstly have important  implications  for breeding  policy.  
Secondly,  from an economic  view point,  schemes  for retaining  heifers  for 
breeding  instead  of selling  heifers  as beef animals  may be required,  par­
ticularly  in the case of the beef cow herd.
Increased  milk output —implications  for 
processing  sector
If creamery  milk supplies  continue  to increase,  what are the implica ­
tions for the processing  sector? The need for extra capacity  depends  
firstly on the seasonality  of milk supplies.  This subject  has been dis­
cussed  in detail at previous  conferences  (1). Hence,  only a summary  of 
the conclusions  is given here.

Irish manufacturing  milk supplies  are highly  seasonal,  unlike  the re­
mainder  of the E.E.C.  (Fig. 5). In butter  manufacture,  if production  in 
the peak month  is taken to be at 100% factory  capacity,  then overall 
capacity  utilisation  in the year in Ireland  is slightly  over 50%. In contrast  
o this, all other E.E.C.  countries  have a corresponding  capacity  utilisa ­
tion of the order  of 70 - 80% (Table  4).

u pattern  it to move in the long-term  towards  that of say
Holland  (Fig. 5) it would mean that present  processing  capacity  could 
hand e l,200 million  gallons  compared  with 853 million  gallons  actually  
handled  m 1978. This would represent  a major saving in investment  
costs at processing  level. Further  savings  at processing  level with a more 
even supply  pattern  would arise in labour  costs, fuel and power costs 
milk assembly  and in product  storage  and stock finance.
On the other hand, a Dutch  type milk supply  pattern  would involve  
a substantial  amount  of autumn  calving  and much  higher  milk production  
costs. Estimates  of the increased  milk production  costs are based here 
on a three year experiment  carried out by An Foras Taluntais  at 
allyraggett  a few years ago (2) in which specialised  autumn  calving 
and spring calving  herds were maintained,  i.e. present  day costs are

applied to the physical  performance  levels in the experiment.  From  
this work it is concluded  that autumn  calvers  would require  at present  
about lOp/gal.  extra over the whole  of the lactation  to compensate  for 
their increased  costs, mainly  due to the increased  meal feeding.  A Dutch  
type milk supply  pattern  would involve  about 45% autumn  calving  and 
55% spring  calving,  as derived  from the shape  of lactation  curves. Hence  
the 45% autumn  calving  at a production  cost increase  of about lOp/gal.  
is equivalent  to a 4.5p/gal.  milk production  cost increase  when spread  
over the total milk supply.
The total savings  at processing  level from a Dutch  type milk supply  
pattern  have been estimated  at about  2ip/gal.,  which  is very considerable  
in processing  cost terms,  but is only about  half of the increased  milk pro­
duction  cost. Hence,  it was concluded  that movement  to autumn  calving 
for a proportion  of the creamery  herd, to give a milk supply pattern  
similar  to Holland,  would not be advantageous  in overall  terms for the 
Irish creamery  industry.
This is not to suggest  that our calving  dates should  remain  static. The 
mean calving  date for the creamery  herd at present  is centred  on March,  
but has been moving  forward  steadily  over the past couple of years. 
Examination  of lactation  curves  for January  and April calvers,  based  on 
a sample  of 1,200 cows in Moorepark  herds,  shows  that lactation  for a 
January  calver  is 10 months  in duration  and is evenly  spread  through  the 
year, whereas  the lactation  for an April  calver  is about  8 months  in dura ­
tion and reaches  a peak in May/June,  the period  of the creameries  over­
all peak supply  (Fig. 6). Hence  movement  towards  earlier  calving  should 
result  in some improvement  in capacity  utilisation  at the processing  level.
All the above discussion  on seasonality  has been related  to storable  
products.  Some level of autumn  calving  would be desirable  in the 
development  of short life products,  which firstly require  more milk in 
winter  than is currently  available  and secondly,  give sufficient  returns  to 
economically  support  a level of autumn  calving  on farms.
Efficiency
The prospect  of limited price increases  in the immediate  future  
places more emphasis  on improvements  in efficiency  at all levels of the 
industry  as a means  of increasing  returns.
One important  area where efficiency  can still be improved  is milk 
assembly.  It is many years since bulk collection  was first discussed,  and 
now over 50% of milk in the country  is collected  in bulk. However,  the 
branch  creamery  system has remained  in many areas and is operating  
side by side with bulk collection.  The consequences  are ;
1. For bulk collection,  while many suppliers  still deliver to branch  
creameries,  bulk tankers  must travel long distances  to collect  a full 
tanker  load thus increasing  bulk collection  costs.
2. The remaining  branch  creamery  system  is even more costly  than the 
original,  as the throughput  at a branch  falls when some of the big 
suppliers  change to bulk collection,  thus raising branch creamery  
operating  costs.
63
FIGURE  6

Studies  of branch  creamery  operating  costs in a number  of co-ops  in 
recent  years show that for branches  with greater  than 500,000  gals, per 
annum,  a 2p/gal.  cost would  be the norm,  whereas  for branches  receiving 
less than 500,000  gals, per annum,  a 3p/gal.  cost would  be typical  (Fig. 7).

The present  position  in many  cases is that when some large suppliers  
leave branches  and transfer  to bulk, the branches  are changed  from the 
greater  than 500,000  gals, category  to the less than 500,000  gals, category.  
In other words,  the branch  creamery  system,  which is already  a very 
costly system  of assembly,  is becoming  even more costly. Both systems, 
branch  and bulk, are at their highest  cost when both are operating  side 
by side. It is surely  time that the final stage in implementing  bulk collec ­
tion was reached.

A Comparison  of the Economics  
of Milk Production  in 
Ireland  and Great  Britain
H. C. HUGHES
Extract  from the British  Milk Marketing  Board,  LCP Information  Unit
Report.
This extract  from the Report  compares  the results,  both physical  and 
financial,  for the two main samples  of farms in Ireland  and in England  
and Wales. It should  be remembered  that the results  are simple  averages  
and as such conceal  a wide range of individual  performance.
Physical  results
The physical  results  for the two samples  of farm are shown  in Table
1).

Stocking  rate (LSU per ha) 1.75 1.90
Nitrogen  use (kg per ha) 170 250
The farm size of the LCP sample  was 50 per cent greater  than that of 
the Irish sample. Land appeared  to be utilized  more intensively,  as 
measured  by a greater  rate of nitrogen  application  and a higher  stocking  
rate.
The management  of the herds as reflected  by milk yield and concen ­
trate input varied  widely,  the LCP farms obtaining  an extra 1,710 litres 
of milk per cow whilst  consuming  an additional  1,375 kg of concentrate.  
This pattern  reflected  a complete  dominance  of spring  calved  animals  in 
the Irish herds,  whilst  the LCP sample  comprised  animals  calving  at all
67
times  of the year. Further,  Ireland  has historically  suffered  low milk prices, 
encouraging  a low cost system,  while in the U.K. far more emphasis  has 
been placed  on yield per cow.
Financial  results
At the time of this study there was no difference  in the value of 
Irish and U.K. currency.  However  market  prices in the two countries  
differ; an outline of the cost of the major commodities  has been 
abstracted  from the two samples  (Table  2).

The most commonly  used measure  of dairy cow efficiency  is margin  
over concentrate,  made by combining  the physical  results  with the price 
levels indicated  above. This margin  for the Irish farms  was £292 per cow 
compared  with £295 in the case of the LCP sample.  These  figures  were  
surprisingly  similar  when one considers  the radically  different  approach  
to concentrate  feeding  coupled  with the difference  in milk output.
Incorporation  of the other costs and returns  attributable  to the dairy  
enterprise  enabled  construction  of the gross margin  shown in Table 3.

The greater  return  obtained  by the Irish for their calves  was balanced  
by a higher cost of replacement  heifers,  and their reluctance  to buy in 
roughage  feeds saved them £16 compared  with their LCP counterparts.  
The net result was an almost  identical  gross margin  per cow, but with 
the LCP herds being 75 per cent larger their total gross margin  was 
almost  £23,000  compared  with £13,000  for the Irish sample.
The whole farm gross margin  was obviously  influenced  by the mar­
gins made by other enterprises;  the Irish figures  in Table 4 being some ­
what higher than the LCP figure mainly  because  of the high transfer  
value of heifers  and the small amount  of concentrate  fed to them. This 
high transfer  value did at the same time reduce  the dairy herd margin.  
Coupling  the gross margins  with fixed costs enabled  a trading  account  
to be calculated  as shown  in Table  4.

The trading  account  shows that the Irish farms had substantially  
higher  profit  than the LCP sample.  This was despite  a smaller  herd size 
and a slightly  less favourable  milk price to concentrate  cost ratio. Thus,  
the Irish converted  a shortfall  of £7,500  in gross margin  to an advantage  
of over £4,000  in terms of profit. This disparity  was highlighted  by an 
examination  of the profit  achieved  per hectare.  A comparison  of each of 
the fixed cost items shows that the Irish are geared to a low input
69
approach,  as was seen earlier  in the case of concentrate.  This approach  
has been fostered  over the years when a relatively  low milk price was the 
order  of the day.
The period  between  1972 and 1978 has brought  a fourfold  increase  in 
milk price,  due to entry to the E.E.C.,  general  inflation,  and government  
action  over the green pound. The first two points  apply equally  to the 
UK but there remains  much greater  scope for price increase  by devalua ­
tion. Whilst  in the U.K.,  inflation  has put great pressure  on to the already  
high level of fixed costs,  in Ireland,  where  the costs  are historically  low, the 
effect  has been far less. Consequently  much  of the increased  milk revenue 
has immediately  been translated  into profit.
The cause of the large fixed costs in U.K. dairying  may well be that 
the LCP herds, in gearing  themselves  up to higher  yields, have at the 
same time adopted  systems  incurring  higher fixed costs, resulting  in 
decreased  rather  than increased  profits.
The low level of fixed costs recorded  on the Irish farms is surprising. 
Observation  of the equipment  on the farms  did however  explain  the posi­
tion. Very little fixed equipment  was present,  indicated  by the lower 
power,  machinery  and depreciation  charges.  Typically  the farmer  owned 
a second hand tractor  plus a fertiliser  distributor  and very little else. 
Major  tasks such as silage making  were often undertaken  by contractor.  
Whilst  most dairy cows were housed,  the buildings  used were simple  and 
intended  for only a relatively  short life. Further,  young  stock tended  to 
be outwintered  far more  than was the case in this country.  With almost  all 
land in Ireland  being owner-occupied  there was no rent to pay and with 
the majority  of land being in the family  for generations  there was little 
mortgage  commitment.  Further,  the low-key  nature of the businesses 
resulted  in very low bank borrowing.
The net result was that the fixed costs were one third of the level 
operating  in the LCP herds,  leading  to a profit of around  £12,500  com­
pared with the £8,000  obtained  by the LCP sample. However,  as was 
mentioned  above,  the Irish farms incurred  no rent and were less heavily 
committed  financially  than the LCP sample. Although  this is obviously 
important  when assessing  the returns  accruing  to the farmer  himself,  it is 
an unsatisfactory  measure  of business  efficiency.  A more  suitable  estimate  
can be made in terms of management  and investment  income  as shown 
in Table  5.
The difference  in profit was reduced  to some extent by the removal 
of the high interest  charges  prevailing  on LCP farms,  and imposition  of 
rental  charge  on the wholly  owner-occupied  Irish farms. Despite  this, the 
Irish sample  obtained  a management  and investment  income  30 per cent 
higher  than that prevailing  on the LCP farms. This was achieved  on a 
smaller  farm which was operating  a far simpler  system of dairy cow 
management.
Whilst  management  and investment  income  is commonly  used as a 
measure  of business  efficiency,  farmers  are more often concerned  with the 
cash position  of the business,  particularly  the availability  of cash to meet 
required  capital and private  expenditure.  A projection  of the trading

Cash surplus 3,171 -3,082
Note : (a) calculation  shown in Appendix  4
It can immediately  be seen from Table 6 that the difference  in profit  
was accentuated  in cash flow terms. The Irish farms  made a surplus  of 
over £3,000  whilst in contrast  their LCP counterparts  made a deficit  of 
£3,000.
This was partly due to the lower profit made by the LCP sample,  
aggravated  by a greater  proportion  of this profit being increase  in valua ­
71
tion, and also to the higher  commitments  of the LCP farms in terms of 
capital and private  expenditure.  Net capital investment  was markedly  
higher than that made by the Irish sample. This would appear  to be 
due to three reasons:  (1) the dairying  system  adopted  is far more inten ­
sive, thus requiring  greater  capital  investment  to maintain  itself; (2) the 
relatively  low profit levels perhaps  in certain  cases stimulate  investment  
to increase  the size of the business;  (3) increased  investment  is a means  
of reducing  the tax burden.
In Ireland,  however,  an extensive  dairying  system  is practiced  and, far­
mers paid no tax before 1974. Further,  the predominant  reaction  to low 
profits  in the past has been to tighten  the belt rather  than intensify.
However  whilst the LCP capital  expenditure  was higher  in absolute  
terms,  the figures  were almost  identical  on a per hectare  basis. This might  
be taken  as evidence  that the Irish, as a result  of current  profitability,  are 
now embarking  on a capital  improvement  programme.  Such expenditure  
will be further  encouraged  when the effects  of taxation  are realised.
The attitude  to capital  investment  was also reflected  in the approach  
to private  spending.  Despite  the large profit made in the current  year,  
private  spending  of £2,750  was small compared  with the £4,023  spent by 
LCP farmers.
Whilst  cash is important,  it may often be satisfactory  from a business 
point of view to increase  an overdraft  in particular,  or liabilities  in gene ­
ral, so long as asset values  are increasing  at a rate to compensate  both for 
this and inflation.  With the rapid escalation  in land values  over the past 
year, both samples  were able to achieve  this comfortably,  but a better  
assessment  of the business  position  of the two samples  can be made by 
comparing  the balance  sheets  at a single  point in time. (Table  7).
The most obvious  difference  was in land values,  mainly  due to the 
Irish being entirely  owner occupiers  whilst in the LCP sample  half of 
the land farmed  was rented.  Further,  land values  in Ireland  were higher  at 
around £4,500 per hectare compared  with an average  of £3,000 in 
England  and Wales. Otherwise  the most salient  point was the difference  
in liabilities,  the LCP sample  having  far higher levels of commitment,  
synonymous  with the more intensive  nature of the business  referred  to 
earlier. One aspect  of Irish policy with regard  to borrowing  seemed  to 
be a desire  to take as much money  as possible  in the form of a long-term 
loan. This contrasts  with the LCP sample  where  a much higher  propor-  
portion  of the borrowing  was taken  as bank overdraft.
Combining  the farm profitability,  as expressed  in terms of manage ­
ment and investment  income,  with the tenants  capital  taken from the 
balance  sheet showed  a return of 23 per cent for the Irish farms, as 
against  11 per cent for the LCP sample.  These  figures  confirm  the outline  
drawn  above  of a currently  more prosperous  Irish dairy industry.

Thus we have a picture  of Irish dairying  being on a solid financial  
base that has existed  for some time. However,  high profits  have now 
been added  to this foundation  and this is beginning  to reflect  in increased  
capital  investment  and private  drawings.  If current  levels of profit con­
tinue,  it seems  inevitable  that this change  will accelerate.

The Scope  for Irish Dairying  in an 
E.E.C.  Context
DR. T. O’DWYER
Milk Products  Division,  European  Economic  Communities,  Brussels.
The future of dairying  in Ire'and  is inevitably  and closely linked to 
policies  established  and pursued  at the European  level. Europe  now has 
a hand in virtually  every aspect  of dairying.  Yet perhaps  the strength  of 
those policies,  and sometimes  their weakness,  is the great bulk of econ ­
omic activity  which takes place within  the industry  with no direct  inter ­
ference from public bodies. The aspects of strength are primarily  
associated  with allowing  the economic  forces to take their normal  and 
natural  courses.  The weakness  is related  to the fact that so much public  
funds  are 'how involved  directly  and indirectly  in supporting  the industry  
that public bodies  at the European  level have a definite  obligation  in 
directing  the future  course  of the industry.  That obligation,  in particular,  
concerns  the growth  rates and future  size of the industry.  Recent  policy 
initiatives  by the Commission  are directed  primarily  towards  containing  
the overall size of the industry  within reasonable  limits and associate  
that industry  size with market  requirements.
Market  analysis
The market  situation  in the dairy sector has been analysed  in con­
siderable  depth in recent  years and especially  in COM (78) 430 final of 
the 25th September.  The salient  points in its conclusions  are that pro­
duction  continues  to increase  and demand  is at best static.
On the production  side, increases  in milk output  are almost  completely  
associated  with increases  in yield/cow.  Cow numbers  have been remark ­
ably stable  over the last decade  at about  25 million.  Yield  per cow which  
in the late sixties  would appear  to have been increasing  at about 1.7%  
per vear. increa.sed  by 2.5% in recent  years and in 1978 yield increased  
by 4%. It is Quite c'ear that yield is increasing  at an increasing  pace and 
no place has that been more true than in Ireland.  These yie’d increases  
are no doubt  resulting  from improved  breeding  but in particular  they are 
the resu't of better herd management  and improved  feeding,  especially  
using higher  levels of concentrate.  Even if the ratio of milk price/feed  
price doesn ’t improve  and perhaps  deteriorates  in the future,  yields  will 
continue  to increase  as more and more producers  get to appreciate  and 
understand  the economic  and technical  relationships  involved.
On the demand  side, the relationships  are much more complex  and 
segmented.  Basic consumer  habits differ widely  throughout  the Com ­
munity. The French consume  high levels of butter and cheese; the 
British  and Irish consume  a lot of butter and drink milk; the Italians  
drink wine, and their consumption  of cheese  is rather  low. Strong  pres­
77
sures exist, both naturally  and through  changing  life styles and through  
market  forces,  towards  reducing  butter  consumption.  Cream  and cheese  
consumption  continues  to increase.  Overall,  the Community  has been 
remarkably  successful  in maintaining  consumption  levels,  in milk equiv ­
alent terms,  in spite of the market  forces,  not improved  by the general  
sluggish  economies  throughout  Europe  and indeed  throughout  the world.
The end result,  in market  terms,  is one of ever increased  production  
and inilk deliveries  to dairies  and just about  static  demand.  The extent  of 
the inilk surplus  in the Community  was estimated  at 10% in 1976. It has 
continued  to increase  since. The extent  of surplus  perhaps  can be more 
strikin^y  expressed  in terms  of product.  Of the milk delivered  to dairies  
m the Community,  some 40% is converted  into butter  and skimmed  milk 
powder.  On the solids-non-fat  side, of the 2 million  tons of skimmed 
milk powder  produced,  some 90% is sold with levels  of support  varying  
between  45 and 90% of the intervention  price. When  skimmed  powder  is 
purchased  into intervention  at say 95 u.a./lOO  kg, it is stored  for say 2 
years,  costing  a further  24 u.a./ 100 kg and is then sold for incorporation  
into pig and poultry  rations  at about 15 u.a. /100 kg. It is surely  clear to 
most jieople  that this is not an economic  proposition  in the long term. 
Increasing  milk output is sometimes  rationalised  for Europe by the 
possibilities  which  exist for further  sales on the world market.
The Community  has already  a very large share of the world  market  in 
dairy produets.  The total world market  is very small compared  with 
world production.  In the developed  regions  of the world,  markets  are 
more than adequately  supplied  with domestic  production  and hence tend 
to be protected.  In the less developed  parts of the world,  the required  
infrastructure  does not exist, for handling  food aid from the Community.  
A considerable  backlog  of earlier  years ’ commitments  still remains  to 
be shipped.
In spite of that gloomy  picture  of the market  situation,  intervention  
stocks  of skimmed  milk powder  have been reduced  significantly  in recent 
years. While production  of powder  increased  by close to 200.000  tons 
in 19178, public  stocks  were reduced  by close to 300.000  tons. This was 
the direct result of the scope and efficiency  of the huge arsenal of 
measures  which the Commission  now has at its disposal  in this sector.  
However,  such an effort is at a large financial  cost hence we continue  
to strive  for more  effective  use of the funds  available.  From  a Communitv  
point of view intervention  tends to be very expensive  and it is much 
less costly if the skimmed  milk can be used directly  for say pig feed 
thus avoiding  the costs  involved  in drying,  financing  and storage.
Against  this background,  it is important  to understand  the dilemma  
racing  the Community  in this sector. It is not just sufficient  to focus on 
the financial  costs which run to some 42% of the Community  budget  in 
agriculture  and 28% of the overall  Community  budget. Some 20% of 
the producers  milk price is accounted  for by this budgetary  input Yet 
m the light of the foregoing  market  situation  and market  return  it surely 
justify  further  expanding  milk output  on a Community
78
d)Policy  objectives  and constraints
In the light of the above situation  the Commission  spelt out its 
objectives  and the guidelines  within  which policy should  be formulated  
over the next years. These  policy  guidelines  are as follows  :
a) to stop the increase  in milk production,
b) to avoid all measures  which run contrary  to this objective  and, in 
particular,  all aids to investment  given by public  funds  at the Com ­
munity  or national  level, which  favour  higher  production  and which  
are still given  at the level of the farm and at the level of the processing  
and marketing  enterprises,
c) to put the stress,  where possible,  on measures  which allow the level 
of consumption  to be maintained,  to increase  the outlets  for milk and 
to reduce  the milk production  potential,
to take the necessary  additional  measures  which  will take account  of 
the social situation  of small milk producers  working  in particularly  
difficult  conditions.
The Commission  also indicated  that these guidelines  would be im­
plemented  against  the background  of a number  of constraints  facing  the 
Community,  which effectively  limit the possibilities  for action. These  
restraints  have been identified  as follows  ;
a) The price relation  between  milk fat and protein  and vegetable  fat 
and vegetable  protein  which is influenced  by the differing  levels of 
external  protection.
The socio-economic  situation  of many small producers  farming  in 
regions  which  offer hardly  any alternative  possibilities.
The limited  outlets  available  on the world market,  either because  of 
restrictions  in certain  third countries  or because  of the high cost of 
additional  exports.
The continuation  of agri monetary  measures.
The general  economic  situation  in the Community  which  is character ­
ised by a high level of unemployment.b)

Commission  proposals
It was in the light of these guidelines  and constraints,  which  seem to 
be generally  understood  throughout  the Community,  that the Commission  
recently  made its proposals  to the Council.  The essential  elements  of 
these proposals  are :
1) No price increase
2) Co-responsibility
3) Continuation  of non-marketing  and conversion  premia
4) Temporary  suspension  of investment  aids
5) Aids to consumption.
1) Price: Price is an essential  element  of any policy aimed at 
reducing  the incentives  for any increase  in output. One may well argue  
about  the degree  of response  to price but there is little argument  about  
its direction.  Individual  producers  in the short term may well increase  
output  in order to maintain  income,  but globally  the response  must be 
of a classical  nature. Maintaining  price over a period is an effective  
decrease  in real terms. However,  production  technology  continues  to
79
advance.  Hence the impact of a non increase  in price is somewhat  
limited,  especially  when green rates are likely to ehange.  This in no way 
detracts  from the importance  of price in policy formulation  and in 
attempting  to bring a better  equilibrium  between  milk output  and con­
sumption  at a Community  level. Although  price is an essential  and 
necessary  element  of pwlicy it is not adequate  to deal with the current  
market  situation.
2) Coresponsibilify  levy : In recognizing  that price in itself is not 
adequate  as a means  of solving  the milk problem,  the Commission  was 
then faced with a series of options  which perhaps  could be summarized  
in the following  list :
a) Quota  arrangements —global  or individual
b) Reduction  of intervention  prices
c) Levy.
a) Quotas  : The Commission ’s view on this point is clearly  expressed 
in COM(78)  430, p. 26, paragraph  48 “Although  a system  of quotas  could 
have an immediate  effect, the Commission  is not in favour  of such a 
system. Such measures  would  be difficult  to reconcile  with the Commun ­
ity’s approach  based on free decision  and internal  trade; it would be 
almost  impossible  to construct  such a policy  without  some inequity  be­
tween different  producers  or regions  of the Community;  production  
quotas  tend to fossilize  the existing  structure;  quotas  would  be extremely  
difficult  to negotiate  and even more difficult  to change,  and consequently  
there is a risk that in due course there would be a return to surplus  
production ”. The substance  of that paragraph  cannot  be refuted  but it 
should  be c'early  recognized  that quotas  are a practical  approach  to the 
problem.  Since they are likely to breakdown  to a member  state division 
of entitlements  in one wav or another,  they are therefore  likely to be 
acceptable  to a number  of member  state administrations.  Hence those 
who fear the imp'ementation  of quotas should be the first to work  
towards  realistic  policy  alternatives.
b) Reduction  of intervention  prices  : Last vear the Commission  pro­
posed a temporary  suspension  of intervention  buying  for skimmed  milk 
powder  during  the winter  months.  It did so in the belief that prices  for 
the skim sector could be maintained  without  reliance  on intervention  
buying  throughout  the year. It did so also with a view to removing  one 
of the unnecessarily  high cost elements  in the milk sector even for a 
limited  period. Other reasons  were to encourage  people to use liquid 
skim directly  for feeding  and to introduce  at least some slight element  
of uncertainty  into the milk market. The proposal,  though  gaining  very 
considerable  support  in the Council,  was not accepted.
The Commission  thus examined  the related approach  of linking  
intervention  buying-in  prices to levels of milk output. As milk output  
increased,  buying-in  prices wou'd be reduced  by a related percentage.  
Such an approach  wou ’d be logical  economically  and would  have a direct  
impact both on producers  and consumers.  It is the tried and tested 
classical  approach  to output  problems  in an industry.  It has the further  
advantage  of being  simple  and straight  forward  to administer and control.
80
It would be the Commission ’s intention  to have had such an approach  
being  adopted  to protect  the ^cio-economic  weaker  sector  of the industry  
from a too drastic change in their situation.  Nevertheless,  the clear  
reaction  to that option  by the member  states  since the Commission  put it 
forward  as a possibility  last September  has been negative.  The interven ­
tion system,  rather  than perhaps  the objective  which lies behind  it, has 
become  sacrosanct.
c) Levy proposals : The option chosen by the Commission  in the 
light of the analysis  and consultations  undertaken  is that of a new ap­
proach  to the coreponsibility  levy. The essential  elements  are as follows ;
i) Level  would be associated  with the changes  in milk output  on a 
Community  basis. For every one per cent increase  in milk output,  
the levy would  be two per cent subject  to a continuing  minimum  of 
two per cent. Transitional  measures  would be established  for the 
period 1st June 1979 to 31st January  1980. The reference  periods  
would  remain  constant  thereafter.  The elements  are shown  in Table  
1.

1.2-79-31.5.791.2.80-31.5.80 1.10.80-31.1.81 2
After the transitional  period of eight months  ending  31.1.1980,  the 
reference  periods  wouM remain  fixed, the base periods  would be 
moved  forward  annually.  Milk deliveries  in the appropriate  base 
period  would  be compared  with the average  deliveries  in the approp ­
riate reference  period and the increase  in deliveries  in percentage  
terms would be multiplied  by the relevant  coefficient  to arrive at 
the level of levy, as a percent  of the target  price which  would  be ap­
plicable  for a further  four month  period. The ground  rules would  
thus be established  by the Council  and the system would have a 
considerable  degree  of automaticity  in the long term while providing  
for some variability  between  application  periods.
81
ii) With a view to protecting  the income  of small producers  with few 
other alternatives  to milk production,  a system  of exemptions  on the 
following  basis are provided  for :
— principal  occupation  is farming,
— under  55 years  of age or between  55 and 60 years  of age and enter  
into a commitment  to cease farming  at the age of 60 years,  con- 
sistant  with directive,  72/160,
— deliver  not more than 60,000  litres of milk per year,
— agricultural  holding  not more than 25 hectares,
— undertake  not to increase  their number  of dairy cows,
— not have more than one dairy cow per hectare.
This approach  can certainly  safeguard  the income  of small farmers  
while having  some deference  to the intensity  of farming  and thereby  
to the use of concentrates.  Commission  estimates  indicate  that when  
these exemptions  are combined  with those presently  existing  in the 
“hill” regions  and southern  Italy,  some 28 f)er cent of milk producers  
delivering  some 12 per cent of the milk would in fact be exempt.  
The corresponding  figures  in Ireland  are 18 per cent and 8 per cent,  
respectively.
iii) The corresponsibility  group would continue  to advise  the Commis ­
sion on the promotion,  advertising  and research  programmes  which  
should  be continued  at about  the present  level.
iv) Such an approach  to the levy is likely in the Commission ’s view to 
be effective  as a disincentive  to further  increases  in milk output  on 
a Community  basis. It is also equitable  between  producers  and 
makes  a great deal of economic  sense.
3) Non marketing  and conversion  premia  : Though  the results  todate  
have not been startling,  nevertheless,  this programme  has had a con­
siderable  degree of success. Up to the end of December  1978, some  
700,000  cows have been accounted  for which reduces  the potential  for 
milk output  by fairly  close to 3%. The response  has been very different  
between  member  states and even between  regions  within  member  states.  
In general,  most people  are favourable  towards  it. Farm leaders  and 
national  administratons  who strongly  favour  its continuity  and enlarge ­
ment are particularly  impressed  with the need for its acceptance,  applica ­
tion and encouragement  in member  states other than their own. This 
type of programme  can be very effective  if the premiums  are high 
enough;  but also if unemployment  benefits  were high enough  nobody  
would  need to work. Where  would  the money  come from ? However,  it 
is proposed  to continue  it for another  year and to the extent that the 
total programme  proposed  by the Commission  is adopted  by the Council,  
it is likely to become  attractive  to a larger  group  of producers  who have 
some other uses for their available  resources.
4) Temporary  suspension  of investment  aids : It appears  totally  
illogical  to continue  to use Community  and national  public  funds  at farm  
and factory  level to further  enlarge  the size of the industry  at a time when 
the central  objective  of any reasonable  policy  in this sector  inevitably  has 
to be to limit its future  growth  to a minimum.  Hence  the Commission ’s 
proposal  for suspension  of aids to investment  at all levels  of the industry,
82
subject  to some exceptions  in very particular  cases. The proposal  is not, 
as has been suggested,  that all investment  should cease but that this 
investment  should  not be assisted  from public  funds. It seems  even more  
illogical  that the member  states (who shall be nameless  !) who claim to 
have a comparative  advantage  in milk production  and who claim to 
produce  milk more efficiently  than anybody  else, should  be foremost  in 
their  opposition  to this proposal.  It would  appear  to be difficult  to defend  
aids to investment  at the manufacturing  level in circumstances  when  
most of the aids heretofore  granted  at that level have yet to be taken up. 
There is little doubt but that all investment  aids in recent  years in this 
sector have led either directly  or indirectly  to further  increases  in milk 
output.
5) Aids to consumption : It has already  been indicated  that adequate  
measures  are now available  to meet the requirements  as they arise in the 
skim sector. However  the butter  sector  is the cause  of increasing  concern  
as stocks rise steadily. In spite of high export refunds  for butter and 
butter  oil, sales at reduced  prices  for pastry  and ice cream  manufacture,  
sales to armies  and non-profit  making  institutions,  for the manufacture  of 
butter concentrate  and reduced  prices for butter for people on social  
assistance,  some further  measures  are clearly  necessary.  Short  term sales 
at reduced  prices,  the so-called  Christmas  butter schemes,  were reason ­
ably successful  in 1977 and 1978—but much more so in the former  than 
the latter. In view of this, the Commission  is proposing  an enlarged  
general  butter subsidy  scheme. Whereas  under present  legislation,  if 
member  states grant a butter  subsidy  of 56 u.a./ 100 kg, the Community  
contribution  is 23 u.a. On the basis of the Commission ’s proposal,  at 
the level of 56 u.a., the Community  contribution  would  be 42 u.a. /100 kg. 
Such a scheme  should  be attractive  to a number  of member  states  besides 
those already  implementing  the butter  subsidy  scheme.
Implications  for Irish dairying
The above paragraphs  outline  the environment  within  which,  on the 
basis of the Commission ’s proposals,  the Irish dairy industry  will be 
operating  in the future. It is an environment  where prices  in real terms  
shall decrease  somewhat  and where aids to further  investment  shall be 
considerably  limited. It is also a situation  where a levy on milk, asso­
ciated  with the level of changes  in milk output  at the Community  level, 
will become  an integral  part of Community  policy. The level of the levy 
should  be such as to provide  a real disincentive  to further  increases  in 
global milk output. Small farmers,  with no other alternatives,  will find 
their income  situation  adequately  protected.  Milk will continue  to be a 
profitable  business  at all levels for those operating  efficiently.  Total out­
put will to a continuing  degree have to be associated  with market  
requirements.  Producers  under  the above proposals  can plan on a sound 
and constructive  policy  being implemented  well into the future  providing  
adequate  scope for enterprise  and technical  and managerial  ability. The 
policy  provides  for equity  between  producers  right throughout  the Com ­
munity  under their varying  circumstances  and thus taking  into account  
their long-term  interests.

EIGHTH  EDWARD  RICHARDS-ORPEN  MEMORIAL  LECTURE
Some  Aspects  of Recent  Research  
in Dairying
F. J. GORDON*
Ai’riciillural  Research  Institute.  Hillshorough,  N. Ireland.
Introduction
I would like to sincerely  thank the Trustees  of the Edward  Richards-  
Orpen Memorial  Trust for inviting  me to present  this Eighth  Memorial  
Lecture.  When  I received  the invitation  I recognised  that it would  not be 
an easy task to pre.sent  a lecture  fitting to the memory  of such a person  
as Mr. Richards-Orpen  about  whom  I have read so many  tributes.  Never ­
theless  I felt that I must accept  the invitation  if the dairy industry  is to 
benefit  from the total research  effort which is being expended  under the 
the favourable  grass-growing  conditions  which  we enjoy throughout  Ire­
land. Indeed  it is because  of this importance  of grass in our ruminant  
based systems  that so much of the nutritional  research  work carried  out 
in other countries,  such as Great Britain,  is of relatively  little direct  value  
in our environment.
The tremendous  potential  for grass  growth,  and hence  animal  produc ­
tion, from grassland  in Ireland  has been recognised  for many years but, 
even yet, I do not think that this is fully appreciated  let alone exploited.  
For example,  the yields of grass dry matter  recorded  in variety  testing  
work at Crossnacreevy  near Belfast  is 60 per cent greater  than the average  
of the other sites for similar  trials throughout  the United  Kingdom  (1).
When research  in dairying  was initiated  at Hillsborough  ten years 
ago it was considered  that the major  effort must be devoted  to exploiting  
this potential  of grass or grass products.  During  this period  a number  of 
different  aspects  have been investigated,  but I intend  to speak  only on the 
following  three areas :
1. Development  of a spring-calving  system.
2. Silage  quality.
3. Protein  nutrition  on indoor  diets.
While the research  work carried  out under 1 above  has been concerned  
solely  with a specific  system,  that under  2 and 3 has been of a more gene ­
ral nature and has implications  for dairy management  irrespective  of 
season  of calving.
1. Development  of a spring  calving  system
In any grass-growing  environment  in which  efficient  milk production  
is required  it is obvious  that a system  which  attempts  to match  the chang ­
ing requirements  of the dairy cow throughout  it’s lactation  to the quantity

and quality  of the feed available  must be of major importance.  This is 
the basis of the spring-calving  system  and for this reason  a considerable  
part of our research  programme  at Hillsborough  has been devoted  to 
developing  such a system. However,  as all those involved  in research  are 
aware,  a research  programme  aimed  at establishing  optimum  systems  for 
any type of animal  production  is extremely  difficult.  This difficulty  arises 
not only because  of the problems  brought  about by the large scale and 
long-term  nature  of the trials, but also because  some basic assumptions  
must be made when establishing  the ‘bare framework ’ of the system  on 
which to build the details. In the present  context  the basis framework  
consisted  of making  broad  decisions  on the calving  pattern  to be adopted,  
the time at which animals  are likely to be able to go to pasture  in the 
spring  and the type of conserved  grass to be used for winter  feed. An 
example  of the implications  of these decisions  is demonstrated  by the fact 
that if a research  programme  was superimposed  on a system  based on 
hay as against  silage for the winter  feed this would affect the answers  
which  would  be obtained  to questions  such as what is the optimum  level 
of nitrogen  fertiliser  and optimum  concentrate  inputs. We assumed  that 
the basic  system  would  have the following  framework :
I. Due to ground  conditions  prevailing  in the North  of Ireland  animals  
will require  to be maintained  indoors  for a minimum  period  of five 
months  and will not be at pasture  until early or mid-April.
Grass  conserved  as silage  should  be the basal winter  diet as it allows  a 
greater  exploitation  of the growth  potential  of grass.
Calving  should  commence  on January  1st and be as compact  as pos­
sible thereafter.
The decision  to calve  early,  relative  to the onset of the grazing  period,  
was based primarily  on the fact that information  produced  by Wood  (2) 
from a survey  of milk yield data from the Milk Marketing  Board for 
England  and Wales  demonstrated  that there was a consistent  decline  in 
lactation  yield with progressively  later calving  after January.  This was 
later confirmed  in an analysis  of data from Hillsborough  (3) which 
showed  a mean decline  in lactation  yield of 220 kg for each month ’s 
delay in calving  between  January  1st and April 1st. A relatively  similar  
decline  of 180 kg/month  has been reported  by Cunningham  (4).
Commencing  with this basic system,  revolving  around  block-calving  
starting  on January  1st, giving  grass silage as the basal diet during  the 
winter period and grazing  pasture  from early April until grass growth  
declines  or land becomes  too wet for grazing  in the autmn,  the object  has 
been to establish  the optimum  inputs  of some of the major  variables  in 
the system. These  include  the amount  of nitrogen  fertiliser  which  should  
be applied  to the grass,  the stocking  rate to be used and the quantity  of 
concentrate  required  to supplement  the basal diets of silage  or grass.2.

Nitrogen  for grazed  pasture
The optimum  level of any input is dictated  by the cost of that input  
relative  to the value of the product  produced,  coupled  with the response 
relationship  between  the input and the product  output. In the case of 
fertiliser  nitrogen  this response  relationship  has been the subject  of more
86
discussion  and debate  over the past 20 years than probably  any other  
input. The response  to nitrogen  has been measured  in terms  of grass dry 
matter  output  in many  grass  cutting  experiments,  but a smaller  number  of 
experiments  have been designed  to assess  the response  in terms  of animal  
output  either as milk or beef. Currently  our thinking  is based on the 
results  from a three year trial, carried  out by my former  colleague  Roger  
Marsh  at Hillsborough  (5) during  the early 1970 ’s, in which  he character ­
ised the relationship  between  nitrogen  input and beef output. This rela­
tionship  indicated  that a substantial  response  in animal product  was 
obtained  up to about 400 kg nitrogen  per hectare. In earlier  work (6) 
carried  out with dairy cows, again over a three year period,  grazed  on 
pasture  receiving  400 and 700 kg nitrogen  per hectare  a marginal  increase  
of only 7 per cent in milk output  at the higher  nitrogen  level was detected.  
The combination  of these two studies  led us to the conclusion  that the 
optimum  nitrogen  input for grazing  under intensive  stocking  conditions  
was likely to be of the order of 400-450 /kg per hectare  and this, there ­
fore, was the level adopted  in the system.  It is recognised,  however,  that 
this recommendation  is not in line with recommendations  in the Republic  
of Ireland  and this is a source  of some concern.  For example  McFeely,  
Butler  and Gleeson  (7) have recommended  a maximum  nitrogen  input of 
250 kg per hectare  with intensive  dairying,  while Collins,  Drennan  and 
Flynn (8) have stated that it is difficult  to recommend  levels of nitrogen  
above 120 kg per hectare  for beef cattle. This disparity  in recommenda ­
tions cannot  be taken lightly  and because  of its importance  we hope in 
the present  year to re-examine  the response  to nitrogen  through  the dairy  
cow.
Nitrogen  for conserved  grass
As ground  conditions  in Northern  Ireland  require  that dairy cows be 
housed  for a period  ranging  from 5 - 6 months  each year there is a very 
large requirement  for conserved  forage. In the practical  context  this may 
best be achieved  through  the use of specialised  conservation  area man­
aged separately  from the grazing  area rather than trying to integrate  
conservation  and grazing  into a single system. With this approach  the 
optimum  nitrogen  input for conservation  can be determined  directly  from 
cutting  trials and an example  of the results  obtained  from one such trial 
carried  out at Hillsborough  (9) is given in Table 1.

400 12570
600 14290
800 14730
87
From results  of this type it has been concluded  that the response  of cut 
herbage  to nitrogen  is considerable,  even to levels above 400 kg per 
hectare,  and that this sort of level can be readily  adopted  for conserva ­
tion.
Stocking  rate at pasture
The optimum  stocking  rate in any dairying  system  will obviously  be a 
function  of the quantity  of grass which  can be produced  per hectare  and 
the nutritional  requirements  of the animals  utilising  this grass. With the 
levels  of nitrogen  used at Hillsborough  relatively  high yields  of grass dry 
matter  are achieved  with amounts  of around 11,000  kg dry matter  per 
hectare  consumed  by cows being regularly  recorded  (10). If a metabol-  
isible energy  value for grass of 11.5 MJ per kg dry matter  is assumed,  
the level of grass energy  output  per hectare  should  be capable  of sup­
porting  around  5.0 cows producing  an average  daily milk yield over the 
the grazing  period  of 15 kg, while  at the same time gaining  in bodyweight  
at the rate of 0.4 kg per day (using  the ME requirements  of Friesian  
cows as given by MAFF,  DAFS  and DANI)  (11). In the first two years 
of our stocking  rate experiments  rates of 6.4 and 4.9 cows per hectare  
over the grazing  season  (3.2 and 2.7 cows per hectare  including  the con­
servation  area) were examined  (12). The results  obtained  from these are 
given under  Experiment  1 in Table  2.
Table 2

Milk output  kg/ha) 16502 14064

Milk output/cow  at pasture  (kg) 2963 3181
Overall  stocking  rate—including  conservation  (cows/ha) 3.0 2.5
In summary  it was found that, while  the output  of milk produced  per 
hectare  of grazing  area was increased  by 17 per cent through  the use of 
the higher  stocking  rate, performance  per animal  was reduced  by about  
11 per cent. From these results  it was concluded  that, while the higher  
stocking  resulted  in a very high milk output  of over 16,500  kg per hectare,  
the depression  in performance  per cow at 276 kg was too great  to be used 
in the practical  context. However  when the lactation  curves of both 
groups  were compared,  it was apparent  that the use of a high stocking 
rate in early season  did not reduce  milk output  during  that period and
88
that the reduction  in milk yield per animal  only occurred  from late June  
onwards.  This led to the approach  of maintaining  high stocking  rates of 
about  6.4 cows per hectare  during  the early  part of the grazing  season  and 
reducing  this in steps as the rate of grass growth  declined  by introducing  
additional  land from the conservation  area to finish at around  4.9 cows  
per hectare  by late September.  By this approach  a high output  of milk 
per hectare  can be achieved  without  depressing  the performance  of the 
individual  animal  too severely.  An example  of the results  obtained  using  
this method  is given  in Table  2 (Experiment  2), in which  the mean  stock ­
ing rate of 5.6 cows per hectare  was obtained  by the systein  outlined  of 
starting  the grazing  season  at 6.4 cows per hectare  and finishing  at 4.9 
cows per hectare  (10). These results  indicate  that a very high level of 
milk output  per hectare  at 16,985  kg could  be produced  with a depression  
in individual  animal  yield of about  7 per cent.
While  the approach  outlined  above  goes some way towards  producing  
high outputs  of milk per hectare  without  reducing  yield per cow too 
severely,  it must be recognised  that the conflict  between  high output  per 
hectare  and high output  per cow remains  one of the major  problems  in 
grass utilisation  and the problem  is likely  to increase  as we steadily  move 
towards  higher  yielding  cows.
There  have been various  attempts  to solve this problem  by manipula ­
tion of the grazing  system. Examples  of this have been the adoption  of 
systems  which  allowed  the higher-yielding  cows to selectively  graze  ahead  
of lower producers  and the use of systems  which  alternated  grazing  and 
cutting.  Neither  of these approaches  seem to offer much  hope  of success.  
An experiment  has also just been completed  at Hillsborough  investigat ­
ing another  approach  (10). To achieve  high outputs  of milk per hectare  
requires  firstly good grass growth  and, secondly,  that grass is grazed  
fairly severely  to ensure  that most of the grass is utilised.  However  it is 
known  that grazing  herbage  severely  reduces  grass intake  per cow and 
hence milk output  per cow. It was felt, therefore,  that if a system  was 
used which  only severely  defoliated  the sward  at intervals  rather  than at 
each grazing  the depression  in yield per cow might be lessened.  In the 
exfjeriment  a conventional  system,  which  involved  a severe  defoliation  at 
each grazing,  was compared  with two systems  in which the sward was 
severely  defoliated  at either alternate  or every third grazing.  All three  
systems  were maintained  at equal stocking  rates. The preliminary  results  
are given in Table 3.
These results show no advantage  for either of the two experimental  
grazing  systems.  In 1977, when the stocking  rate was sufficiently  high 
to depress  yield per animal  by 10 per cent on the conventional  system,  
there appeared  to be some advantage  from the system  where  severe  de­
foliation  was carried  out at every third grazing.  A similar  effect was not 
obtained  in 1978 but this may have been due to good grass  growth  in that 
year resulting  in a low depression  in yield per cow at the higher  stocking  
rate of only 4 per cent. It seems unlikely,  therefore,  that this approach  
of alternating  lax and severe  grazing  will offer any scope  for improvement  
although  I feel that the general  concept  still merits  some research  consi ­
deration.

Level  of concentrate  supplementation  during  the indoor  period
Where the winter  diet of the spring-calving  cow is to be based on 
silage the nutrient  requirement  of the fresh calved animal  will exceed 
those that can be supplied  from silage alone and the deficiency  has to be 
remedied  by the use of supplementary  concentrates.  However  the ques ­
tion of how much concentrate  to feed during  this period  is continually  a 
rnatter  for debate.  It could  be argued  that the quantity  can be determined  
simply  from a calculation  based on the theoretical  requirements  of the 
animal  and a knowledge  of the nutritive  value of the feeds. While such 
an approach  may satisfy  the nutritionist  it may not necessarily  provide  
the correct  answer  in terms of economics.  This can only be determined  
by firstly establishing  the way in which the animal  will respond  to a 
change  in concentrate  input and from this deciding  the optimum  econo ­
mic level of supplementation.  A series of three experiments  has been 
carried  out at Hillsborough  in order to provide  data on the response  in 
milk output  to a change  in concentrate  input. In all of these studies 
cows have had ad libitum  access  to medium-good  quality  grass silage  with 
“D”-values  of the order of 65 - 67 and metabolisable  energy  contents  of 
about 10.0 MJ per kg dry matter. No concentrates  were given prior to 
calving  and in each year the animals  have calved  from early January  until 
early March,  with a mean calving  date of between  January  18-25th  in 
any year. In each year the animals  went to pasture  during  early-mid  
April.
In Experiment  1 three levels of concentrate  of 3.8, 5.5 and 7.2 kg per 
day were used from calving until going to pasture in each of two 
years (13). At pasture  the cows were grazed  at a mean stocking  rate of
5.5 cows per hectare  without  any concentrate  supplementation  other than
90
for 7 - 10 days after turn out in the spring. The results  obtained  are given 
in Table  4.

Liveweight  at end of lactation  (kg) 606 606
Increasing  the concentrate  input not only increased  milk yield indoors  
but also resulted  in substantially  more milk being  produced  at grass. The 
overall  effect was therefore  that the higher  concentrate  input provided  
the greatest  economic  return.
In Experiment  2 a higher  level of supplementation  of 9.5 kg per day 
was compared  with that of 7 kg per day which  had been found  to be best 
in the previous  trial (12). Again  the experiment  was carried  out over a 
two year period  and the animals  were grazed  at a mean stocking  rate of 
5.7 cows per hectare.  The results  in Table  4 show that, while the higher  
level of concentrate  feeding  indoors  increased  the quantity  of milk pro­
duced during  the indoor  period,  it did not improve  total lactation  yield  
because  the animals  on the higher level of supplementation  tended  to 
produce  less at pasture.  The result  was obtained  even though  theoretical  
calculations  of nutrient  requirements  indicated  that the higher  level of 
supplementation  was the more nutritionally  correct  diet.
Because  of the scepticism  for these results  displayed  by those con­
cerned  with high concentrate  inputs  a further  experiment  was undertaken  
to examine  further  high concentrate  inputs  (14). In this trial (Experiment

3) 7.2 kg per day of concentrate  was compared  with a higher  input than 
that used previously  at 10.5 kg per day. The results  obtained  are given 
in Table 4. Again the higher concentrate  input increased  milk output  
indoors,  but reduced  the subsequent  performance  at pasture  with the 
net effect being  that total lactation  yield was not improved.
The conclusion  from this series of experiments  must be that when  
good quality  silage,  given ad libitum,  forms the basal diet the optimum  
level of concentrate  supplementation  is around  7.2 kg per day. Higher  
levels  than this cannot  be justified  even with animals  giving  5,100  kg milk 
per lactation,  which is the mean yield of all animals  used over the five 
year experimental  programme.
Pattern  of concentrate  supplementation
The research  work described  previously  had clearly  established  the 
optimum  level of concentrates.  However  the question  arises  as to whether  
concentrates  should  be allocated  at the same level per day from calving  
until going to pasture  or whether  it would be better to allocate  more  
concentrates  immediately  post-calving  in order to stimulate  production  
at the commencement  of lactation. For example  Broster  and his col­
leagues  at the National  Institute  for Research  in Dairying  (15) have sug­
gested that improved  feeding  during  the first four weeks after calving  
has a substantial  beneficial  effect  on production  throughout  the remainder  
of the lactation. A two year experiment  was therefore  undertaken  to 
compare  a flat-rate  feeding  system  in which each animal  received  the 
same level of concentrates  per day from calving  until going to pasture  
with a high/low  system  in which much higher  amounts  of concentrates  
were given  during  the first four weeks  after calving  (14). All animals  had 
access  to the same silage  and the total input of concentrates  was similar.  
The results  are given in Table  5.
Table 5
Effect  of pattern  of concentrate  allocation  after calving
Concentrate  allocation  system Flat rate High/low
Total concentrate  input (kg) 412 402
Milk yield indoors  (kg) 1851 1848
Milk yield at pasture  (kg) 3170 3048
Total lactation  yield (kg) 5021 4893
These  results  showed  that adopting  a high/low  system  had no beneficial 
effect on either  the amount  of milk produced  indoors  or during  the total 
lactation.  This, therefore,  eliminates  the need to use high concentrate  
inputs  during  the post-calving  period  when  digestive  upsets  are frequently  
encountered.
In this comparison  all animals  within each treatment  received  the 
same amount  of concentrates  irrespective  of the yield of the individual
93
cow. In a further  experiment  a flat-rate  feeding  system  in which  all ani­
mals received  the same quantity  of concentrates  was compared  with a 
high/low  system in which the concentrate  input for each animal  was 
related  to its milk yield with high yielding  animals  receiving  more and 
low yielders  less concentrate  (16). The effect on milk yield is shown  in 
Table  6.

Milk yield indoors  (kg) 1946 1954
Mean  yield after 10 wks. at pasture  (kg/d) 18.4 18.5
There was no effect of system  of allocation  on milk output  during  the 
indoor  period  and, while the experiment  did not embrace  a full lactation,  
the performance  during  the first ten weeks  at pasture  did not show any 
difference  in residual  effects.
The results of this and the previous  experiment  show that with a 
spring  calving  system  a uniform  daily feed allowance,  irrespective  of stage  
of lactation  and milk yield potential  of the individual  cow, will produce  
equivalent  results  compared  with more complicated  systems  which  either  
aim to achieve  high peak yields  or allocate  feed according  to milk yield.
Concentrate  supplementation  at pasture
The use of concentrates  as a supplement  for dairy cows at pasture  has 
been a feature  of the U.K. dairy industry  for many years. This practice  
has been founded  on a continual  attempt  by the dairy farmer  to provide  
for the nutritional  requirements  of the lactating  animal.  However  it must 
be appreciated  that the short term nutritional  requirements  of the animal  
are of much less importance  than is the economic  response  to any addi­
tional feed given,  provided  the long term nutrition  and health is not im­
paired. Leaver,  Campling  and Holmes  (17) reviewed  the results from 
experiments  in which  the response  in milk yield to concentrates  given at 
grass  had been assessed  and, in general,  the results  indicated  that between 
2 to 5 kg concentrates  were required  to produce  an extra 1 kg milk. How ­
ever most of the experiments  were conducted  with cows which  were not 
in early lactation  and high yielding  with the result that critics  have sug­
gested that the findings  may not be applicable  to the higher-yielding,  
spring-calving  cow. For this reason  an experiment  was carried  out at 
Hillsborough  to examine  the response  from cows calving  during  March  
and April (18). These cows were producing  on average  28 kg milk per 
day prior to going  to pasture  and were grazed  together  as a single  group  
at a stocking  rate of 5.5 cows per hectare  throughout  the experiment  
which  lasted for 14 weeks. The cows were given three levels of cereal-  
based supplement  of 0.45, 2.25 and 4.05 kg per day. There  was a good
94
supply  of grass available  throujghout  the experiment.  The mean perfor ­
mance  over the period  is given in Table  7.

These results  show that even with high-yielding,  spring-calving  cows  
the response  to additional  concentrates  when ample  grass is available  is 
extremely  low. It has now been shown  conclusively  that the major  reason  
for this small response  to supplements  at grass is due to the supplement  
depressing  the intake of herbage  by the aiiimal  with the net result that 
the total nutrient  intake  is only marginally  increased.  It has been argued  
that, while cereals  result in a considerable  depression  in herbage  intake,  
the effect could be reduced  by using supplements  which are more com­
plementary  to the digestion  of forages  in the rumen. Dried  grass was felt 
to be a possibility  and some work has been carried  out at Hillsborough  
to examine  if the inclusion  of this forage  in the supplement  mix, or giving  
a sole supplement  of dried grass, would improve  performance  (19). In 
essence  the results  have shown  that neither  the use of dried grass on its 
own nor it’s inclusion  as a proportion  of the supplment  has improved  the 
response  at pasture.
The above  results  demonstrated  clearly  that when  there  was a reason ­
able supply  of grass, concentrate  supplementation,  even to high-yielding  
animals,  was of no economic  benefit.  However  there are occasions  when  
grass is in short supply  and it seems  likely  that in such circumstances  the 
response  to supplementation  would  be greater.  Such circumstances  arose  
during  the very dry summer  period  in 1976 when  the rate of grass  growth  
was extremely  low. During  this period  of grass shortage  a trial was set 
up to assess  the effect  of providing  supplementary  feed (20). Three  treat ­
ments were applied  to a group of cows grazing  as a single group at a 
stocking  rate of approximately  4.5 cows per hectare.  In one treatment  no 
supplement  was provided  while in the other  two treatrrients  4 kg per day 
of a supplement  containing  9 or 21 per cent crude  protein  was given. The 
results  obtained  are given in Table  8.

The milk yield response  to both supplements  was considerably  greater  
than those  normally  reported  due to the very limited  supply  of grass avail ­
able. However  even in such circumstances  the response  of 0.6 and 0.8 
kg milk per kg of concentrates  for the high and low protein  supplements  
respectively  did not increase  the profitability  of milk production.  It may, 
however,  be worth  noting  that the response  tended  to be greater  with the 
higher  protein  supplement  and this is an area which  could merit research  
work if for any reason in the future supplements  should be used at 
pasture.
Performance  of spring-calving  system
The foregoing  discussion  has been concerned  with an examination  of 
the individual  components  of the spring-calving  system. However  
throughout  this experimental  programme  attempts  have been made to 
incorporate  each aspect into an overall  system  of management  for the 
existing  herd. The system  now adopted  therefore  incorporates  these re­
search  findings.  Basically  this implies  a block-calving  programme  com­
mencing  at the beginning  of January  and aiming  for completion  by early  
March. No concentrates  are given prior to calving  and all animals  are 
given a uniform  concentrate  input of 7.2 kg per day, irrespective  of yield  
potential  or lactation  number,  from calving  until going  to pasture.  Graz ­
ing commences  during  early to mid-April  at a stocking  rate of 6.4 cows  
per hectare  during  the early season  decreasing  in steps to reach 4.9 cows  
per hectare  by early August  and with about 430 kg N per hectare  being  
applied  over the grazing  season. No concentrates  are given at pasture,  
except  during  the first 7-10 days after turnout,  and from early October  
when all lactating  animals  receive  1.6 ke per day until drying  off. Animals  
are housed  with ad libitum  access  to silage from October  or November.  
The performance  for the herd during  the 12 month  period  ending  Decem ­
ber, 1978, embracing  all experimental  treatments  is given in Table 9.

This performance  indicates  that there is considerable  potential  for achiev ­

inputs  and is the basis for a very sound  dairying  industry.

Rearing  replacement  heifers
While  the management  of the dairy cow during  the productive  period  
of her life has been the major  area of research  work carried  out at Hills ­
borough,  an attempt  has also been made to provide  information  on the 
rearing  of the replacement  stock for the spring-calving  system. At the 
outset it was realised  that, with the relatively  small numbers  of replace ­
ments being reared per year at the Institute,  there was little point in 
becoming  involved  in some of the major  problems  such as age or weight 
at calving.  Instead  the approach  was adopted  that we could achieve  best 
results  by using all available  information  from other centres  throughout  
the world  on these basic questions  and use our resources  to evaluate  how 
the present  target performance  could be best achieved  within a grass  
environment.  The targets  which  have been assumed  are that two year old 
calving  is essential  on economic  grounds  and that, if adequate  lactation  
performance  is to be achieved,  a pre-calving  liveweight  of over 500 kg is 
required.  Furthermore  to achieve  an adequate  conception  rate a live- 
weight  of over 300 kg at mating  is required  and, indeed,  if the pre-calving  
target of 500 kg is to be met it is preferable  that animals  are approxi ­
mately  320 kg at mating.  The problem  in such rearing  systems  has always 
been that of achieving  adequate  growth  during  the early months  of the 
animals  life. A series of experiments  has therefore  been carried  out to 
examine  some of the factors  which might affect performance  during  this 
period.
Effect  of date of turnout  to pasture  during  the first year
In Northern  Ireland  weather  conditions  are generally  unsuitable  to 
allow young  calves  born during  the spring  to go to pasture  before  mid to 
late April. An experiment  was therefore  carried  out to examine  whether  
these animals  should  go to pasture  at this stage or, alternatively,  be re­
tained indoors  for a further  period in an effort to achieve  higher  live- 
weights  before  going  to pasture.  The experiment  was run for two seasons,  
in each season  animals  were put to pasture  either  during  late April,  late 
May or late June. In each case no concentrates  were given throughout  
the grazing  period  which lasted until mid-October.  The groups  retained  
indoors  received  2 kg concentrate  per day in addition  to grass silage. At 
pasture  all calves  grazed  together  as the leader  group  in a leader-follower  
system. The mean results  over the grazing  period  are given in Table 10.

97
During  the extra period when the animals  were maintained  indoors  
they grew considerably  faster  than the group  which  went to pasture  early.  
However,  when these groups  went to pasture  their subsequent  perfor ­
mance  was considerably  poorer  than the group  that had already  been at 
pasture. The result was that by the end of the grazing  season  the group  
put to pasture  early was of similar  liveweight  to the other two groups 
and had consumed  considerably  less concentrates  during the rearing  
period. In addition  the management  at pasture  had been much easier  
than when the animals  were retained  indoors.
From this experiment  it was found that where  animals  were given no 
supplementary  feed during  the pasture  period  a total input  of concentrates  
of approximately  375 kg per animal  was required  in addition  to silage  of 
63 “D” value during  the yearling  winter  to achieve  a mean liveweight  at 
mating  of 320 kg. The question  arose as to whether  providing  some of 
this concentrate  during  the previous  grazing  period would result in a 
better overall  performance.  An experiment  was set up to examine  the 
effect of providing  differing  proportions  of the concentrate  during  the 
grazing  period,  but maintaining  a constant  level of total concentrate  input  
per animal up to mating. Four treatments  were applied  with animals  
getting  0, 15, 36 or 57 per cent of their concentrates  during  the pasture  
period  and the remainder  during  the following  winter. All animals  were 
grazed  as a single,  leader  group  at pasture  and had ad libitum  access  to 
silage of approximately  63 “D” value during  the following  winter. The 
results  are given in Table 11.

Supplementary  concentrates  at pasture  resulted  in a slight improvement  
in liveweight  gain at pasture,  but the response  was small. By the end of 
the following  winter the group which had received  all its concentrates  
indoors  was heavier  than any of the other three groups,  indicating  that 
when adequate  high quality  pasture  is available  concentrate  supplemen ­
tation  should  be limited  to the indoor,  winter-feeding  period.
Type of concentrate  given  indoors
A further  trial has been completed  to assess  the effect of protein  con­
tent of the supplement  given in addition  to silage during  the yearling  
winter. Two supplements  consisting  of either a barley/mineral  mixture,  
containing  9 per cent crude protein,  and a barley/soyabean  mixture,  con-

in equal  amounts  of 2.1 kg per day. The effects  on silage  intake  and final 
liveweight  at the end of the winter  are shown  in Table 12.
Type of supplement  did not affect either silage dry matter  intake  or the 
liveweight  of the animals  at the end of the winter  period,  indicating  that

the cheaper  supplement  consisting  of barley  and minerals  is adequate  as 
a supplement  for silage  during  the yearling  winter.
Length  of dry period  at end of first lactation
With spring-calving  animals  in their first lactation  there is a tendency  
for body condition  to decline  considerably  during  the pasture  period,  with 
the result that the condition  of these animals  at the end of lactation  
is generally  below that of the mature  cow managed  in the same system.  
The question  arises  as to whether  this relatively  poor body condition  will 
affect subsequent  performance  and, if it does, how can it be improved.  
One approach  is to increase  the length  of the dry period  by terminating  
the first lactation  at an earlier  date. An experiment  is in progress  at the 
Institute  to examine  the effect of drying  animals  off four weeks earlier  
than normal. The preliminary  results  from this are given in Table 13.

Drying  the animals  off four weeks  earlier  than normal  increased  the fol­
lowing lactation  yield by 261 kg. However  an approximately  similar  
quantity  of milk was lost from this group  during  the first lactation,  due to 
the early drying-off,  with the effect that total production  assessed  over the 
first two lactations  was unaffected.  However  this study will continue  and 
will be extended  into subsequent  lactations  to establish  whether  there is 
any further  residual  effect.
2. Silage  Quality  
Interval  between  regrowths
The optimum  re-growth  interval  for grass for silage  has been the sub­
ject of considerable  debate  and the purpose  of some of our work has 
been to establish  the effect of different  re-growth  intervals  on milk pro­
duction.  To date two experiments  have been completed.  In the first 
experiment  re-growth  intervals  of 5 and 9 weeks  were compared  using a 
predominantly  perennial  ryegrass  sward (21). The resulting  silages  were  
offered  ad libitum  to lactating  cows with the same quantity  of concentrate  
being given with each silage. The effect of these treatments  on intake  of 
silage dry matter,  milk yield and liveweight  at the end of the experiment  
are given under  Experiment  I in Table 14.

Reducing  the regrowth  interval  from 9 to 5 weeks  resulted  in an 11 per 
cent increase  in silage  dry matter  intake  and 2.5 kg per day in milk yield.  
In the second  experiment  three silages  made after regrowth  intervals  of 
5, 7 and 9 weeks  were assessed  by again  offering  the silages  to dairy cows  
receiving  7.2 kg concentrates  per day (21). The results  are given under  
Expediment  2 in Table 14. The effect on intake  in this trial was greater  
than in the previous  one with a 33 per cent increase  in silage  dry matter  
intake being obtained  by decreasing  the regrowth  interval  from 9 to 5 
weeks. The effect on milk yield however  was similar  to that obtained  in 
Experiment  1.
102
Effect  of wilting  prior  to ensiling
A total of three experiments  have been carried  out to examine  the 
effect of wilting  prior to ensiling  on the milk producing  potential  of the 
resulting  silage (21). In all experiments  the unwilted  herbage  was ensiled  
within 15 minutes  of being mown by rotary mower  and all silages  were 
made with a precision-chop  harvester.  All silages had formic acid 
(Add-F,  B.P. Chemicals  Ltd.) applied  at the rate of approximately  2.2 
litres per tonne  of herbage  ensiled.  The length  of time required  to achieve 
the required  degree of wilt varied between  1 and 5 days in the three  
experiments.  Within  each experiment  cows on both treatments  received 
the same level of concentrate  supplementation  on a fixed daily basis.
The results  of the three experiments  are given in Table 15.

In Experiment  1 wilting  to 35 per cent dry matter  slightly,  but not sig­
nificantly,  improved  the intake  of silage dry matter  but had no effect on 
milk yield. In the second  experiment  wilting  to 47 per cent dry matter  
increased  silage intake by 11 per cent, but significantly  depressed  milk 
output. In Experiment  3 wilting  to 39 per cent dry matter  resulted  in an 
increase  in silage intake  of 10 per cent, but had no effect on milk yield.  
Over the three experiments  wilting  increased  intake  on average  by 8 per 
cent and reduced  milk yield by 2.5 per cent or 0.6 kg per day.
While  such results  do not give much encouragement  for wilting  there  
are however  two factors  which should be remembered.  Firstly fairly  
heavily  wilted silages  were used in all three experiments  and it is still 
open to question  as to whether  a response  might not be obtained  with 
more moderate  degrees  of wilting,  for example  to 25 - 28 per cent dry
103
matter. An experiment  is in progress  at present  to provide  data on this 
point. Secondly,  even if no benefit  is obtained  in terms of animal  pro­
duction  from wilting,  this does not in itself imply  that wilting  should  not 
be carried  out. The whole  concept  of wilting  is much  more  complex  than 
the effect on animal  production  and involves  pollution,  mechanisation,  
speed of harvesting,  ease of handling,  these being aspects  which each 
farmer  must take into account  in making  decisions  on the value of wilt­
ing. I also feel, however,  that there are areas within  silage  making  which 
have not to date been sufficiently  researched  to enable  the farmer  to make  
rational  decisions.  These include  the question  of the effects of silage ­
making  machinery  and harvesting  techniques  on the losses incurred  in 
silage  making  and subsequent  production  of the sward.
Protein  nutrition  on indoor diets
Over the past 20 - 30 years a considerable  volume  of research  work 
has been carried  out on the effect of level of protein  intake  on milk out­
put. In summary  it could be said that little response  has been obtained  
to increasing  protein  intake above that required  to meet theoretical  re­
quirements.  However,  there  are two aspects  which  must be borne  in mind 
before concluding  that all the answers  are known. Firstly,  the bulk of 
the evidence  has been derived  from experiments  in which  different  protein  
levels have been compared  on diets which supplied  theoretical  energy  
requirements  and, secondly,  hay has generally  been the basal diet. With 
regard  to the first point there is now sufficient  evidence  to show that there  
is an interrelationship  between  the response  to providing  additional  pro­
tein and the level of energy  intake (22). For example.  Fig. 1 shows  the 
effect on milk output  of giving  concentrates  of two protein  contents  over 
a range of feeding  levels ranging  from 0.25 - 0.58 kg per kg milk. These  
data were obtained  using cows given two concentrates  containing  either  
12 or 18 per cent protein  in addition  to a basal diet of hay which  supplied  
maintenance  energy  and protein  requirements.  The important  aspect  of 
these results was that at low rates of concentrate  supplementation  no 
benefit  was obtained  from using a concentrate  containing  more than 12 
per cent protein even though this theoretically  represented  a severe  
deficiency  in protein. However,  as the amount  of concentrates  was in­
creased  the increase  in milk yield obtained  from using  the higher  protein  
level became  larger and was greatest  at the highest  level of concentrate  
input. The results also show another  important  point which is that a 
given level of milk yield could be supported  by giving  two protein  con­
centrates  at different  rates. For example,  the 18 per cent protein  concen ­
trate given at the rate of 0.4 kg per kg milk supported  a yield of 16.9 kg 
per day which,  in turn, could alternatively  have been supported  by giving  
the 12 per cent protein  concentrate  at the rate of 0.48 kg per kg milk.  
This demonstrates  that there may be a degree of substitution  between 
protein  content  and feeding  level in the practical  situation,  which can 
become  very important  as the relative  prices  of protein  sources  and cereal 
grain change.
The work involving  intake discussed  above was carried  out with a 
basal diet of hay. However,  the majority  of cows on progressive  farms
104

within  the U.K. and Ireland  are given diets based on silage. In view of 
the fact that the crude protein  content  of silage is relatively  high, nutri ­
tionists  would argue that a low protein  supplement  would provide  for 
theoretical  protein  requirements.  There  is, however,  a growing  volume  of 
evidence  to question  this concept. For example.  Table 16 shows the 
results  from an experiment  in which  cows were given similar  amounts  of 
four concentrates,  but with the concentrates  varying  in protein  content  
from 10 to 21 per cent (23). All four concentrates  were given in addition  
to a basal diet of wilted  grass silage  with a “D” value  of 67.
While in theory  adequate  protein  was supplied  by the concentrate  con­
taining  13.7 per cent protein,  there was a considerable  increase  in milk 
output  up to 21 per cent protein  in the supplement.  A further  experiment  
was therefore  carried  out to examine  a wider range of protein  intakes  in
105

order  to establish  at what level of protein  in the concentrate  the maximum  
milk yield was obtained.  In this trial concentrates  with six protein  con­
tents ranging  from 10 to 29 per cent on a fresh basis were used (24). The 
effects  on milk output  are shown  in Fig. 2 and the relationship  between

milk yield and the percentage  protein  in the concentrate  can be described  
by the following  relationship :
Y = 8.95 + 1.0 X - 0.0205X'
where  Y = milk yield in kg/day  and X = percentage  protein  in the sup­
plement  on a fresh weight  basis. *
Using this relationship  it has been calculated  that for this particular  
silage maximum  milk yield is achieved  by giving  a concentrate  contain ­
ing 24.4 per cent protein  on a fresh basis. However,  economic  return  
is maximised  at the point where the cost of an additional  unit of 
protein  is offset by the returns  in terms of the additional  milk produced.  
At present  Northern  Ireland  prices,  a percentage  unit increase  in protein  
content  increases  the cost of the ration  by about  £1.20 per tonne. With  
milk at 1 Ip per litre an increase  of approximately  0.09 kg milk per day is 
required  to cover this cost and profit is therefore  maximised  at 22 per 
cent protein  content  in the concentrate.  £ven if the cost of increasing  
protein  content  were to double  relative  to the value of milk, profitability  
would still be maximised  with a concentrate  containing  around  20 per 
cent crude  protein.
There is, however,  one point with regard  to the response  to protein  
which as yet has been unexplained.  This refers to the fact that while 
the two previous  experiments  have shown  large responses  to protein,  a 
further  trial at Hillsborough  did not demonstrate  this effect. If the infor ­
mation  coming  from other centres  is also examined  it also appears  that 
there has been a response  in some cases but not in others. The question  
arises as to why this difference  is obtained —is it due to the animals  used 
in these trials or the silages  which  they have been given?
In an attempt  to answer  this point a changeover  trial has been carried  
out to determine  whether  the response  to increased  protein  is affected  by 
wilting  prior to ensiling.  In this trial a high digestibility  grass  was ensiled  
either directly  or after wilting  to 39 per cent dry matter. Each of these  
silages  was given with supplements  containing  13 or 21 per cent crude  
protein  on a fresh basis. The preliminary  results  from this trial are given 
in Table 17.

These results  showed  little response  to increased  protein  when the un­
wilted  material  was used yet, when the same material  was wilted,  a con­
siderable  and statistically  significant  increase  in yield was obtained  when  
the protein  content  of the supplement  was increased.  The response  of 
2.2 kg milk obtained  with the wilted material  is directly  in line with the 
response  obtained  in our earlier  trials.
Conclusion
In conclusion  let us now turn our thoughts  to some of the areas in 
which  further  research  is needed.  In this I do not want to produce  a cata­
logue of areas requiring  further  research,  but rather to concentrate  on 
what I consider  to be the major  areas within  the three topics  that I have 
discussed.
Firstly  the major  problem  confronting  us in the spring-calving  system 
is the conflict  between  maintaining  a high output  per animal,  in this case 
a high milk yield,  while ensuring  that our stocking  rates are high enough 
to efficiently  use the grass which  we grow. It has been seen that 250 - 500 
litres of milk per cow may be lost at high stocking  rates, a loss which  
cannot  be tolerated,  and an effect  which  will become  more  serious  as yield  
per cow increases.  It is likely, therefore,  that this will be an increasing  
problem  in the dairy industry  and I consider  that within the next few 
years this will be a major  factor affecting  the attitude  of the farmer. It 
is important,  therefore,  that research  workers  should  consider  ways of 
maximising  the use of grass without  severely  depressing  yield per animal.  
Unless  a solution  to this problem  is found farmers  will relax stocking  
rates and possibly  use supplementary  feeds in the quest for high milk 
yields  per cow. Both these  approaches  would  be detrimental  to the long­
term good of the industry.
Secondly,  with regards  to silage production  we are now at the stage  
where  the effects  of different  types of silages  on animal  performance  have 
been quantified.  However,  we seem to have completely  forgotten  that 
machinery  is required  to produce  silage  and remarkably  little information  
IS available  on the interaction  between  the machine  and the grass sward. 
For example,  what effect has machinery,  including  both type and weight  
of equipment,  on the quality  of the silage,  the losses  during  ensilage,  and 
subsequent  production  from the sward? It is now time that the best type 
of equipment  for silage making  has been identified  by research  workers  
and these requirements  met by the engineer,  rather  than indiscriminately  
using the equipment  produced  by manufacturers  which very often were 
designed  for conditions  completely  different  to those under which we 
operate.
Finally  our understanding  of silage supplementation  is still confused 
with, for example,  there being large and unexplained  differences  in the 
response  to supplementary  protein  between  silages. We must identify 
why this is so in order  that we can provide  a more correctly  balanced  sup­
plement,  both in terms  of energy  and protein,  for differing  types  of silages.  
We shall not be efficiently  using the feed available  until this can be 
achieved.

A COMPARISON  OF RED CLOVER  AND GRASS  SILAGES  FOR  
BEEF  PRODUCTION
R. W. J. STEEN
Agricultural  Research  Institute  uf N. Ireland,  Hillsborough,  Co. Down.
Two experiments  have been conducted  to compare  red clover and 
grass silages  for beef production  and to examine  the effects  of digestibility  
of red clover silage and the level of concentrate  supplementation  on 
animal  performance.  In the first experiment  red clover silages  of high 
and low digestibility  (700 and 600 g kg~' respectively)  were produced  by 
cutting  red clover  (van Hungaropoly)  at early and late stages  of maturity  
These silages and a grass silage (DMD 710 g kg-') which had been 
harvested  from a perennial  ryegrass  sward after a growth  interval  of 7 
weeks  were offered  ad libitum  to 48 British Friesian  steers (initial live- 
weight  229 kg) for a period  of 11 weeks.  The silages  were unsupplemented.  
Sdage  dry matter  intake  (kg day ') and animal  liveweight  gain (kg day-')  
for the three silages  were 7.75, 0.89, 6.91, 0.69, 5.59, 0.59 for the high 
digestibility  red clover, low digestibility  red clover and grass silages  
respectively.
In the second  experiment  red clover silage (DMD  625 g kg”') and 
grass  silage  (DMD  755 g kg"')  which  had been harvested  from a pierennial  
ryegrass  sward after a growth  interval  of 9 weeks were offered  unsup ­
plemented  or supplemented  with 2 kg of fortified  barley  per head per day 
to 48 British  Friesian  steers (initial  liveweight  332 kg) for a period  of 19 
weeks. Silage  dry matter  intake,  animal  liveweight  gain and carcase  gain 
data for this trial were presented.

INITIAL  RESULTS  OF A DAIRY  HERD  SURVEY  IN 
NORTHERN  IRELAND
W. J. McCAUGHEY,  C. H. McMURRAY  and E. A. GOODALL  
Veterinary  Research  Laboratories.  Storniont,  Belfast.
A stratified  random  sample  of 600 herds (230 cows per herd) was 
investigated  by interview.  Returns  were received  from 515 herds rep­
resenting  17% of all dairy cows. These returns  are being examined  for 
interactions  between  fertility  and those factors  which  have been consid- 
ered to influence  the results  achieved.
There was a significant  difference  between  the calving pattern of 
heifers  (concentrated  in October-November)  and cows (distributed  uni­
formly  from October  to March). This difference  may be the result of 
cumulative  time lost annually  through  reduced  fertility.
There was widespread  use of three breeding  policies,  i.e. Bull only,  
A.I. only and A.I. plus bull. Almost  equal numbers  of cows are mated  
by A.I. and by Bull. The overall  non-return  rate was 71%. Herds  using 
bulls for all breeding  had the highest  non return  rate; those  with A.I. had 
the lowest  and the dual policy  gave an intermediate  value. These  records  
resulted  in tighter  calving  patterns  in the herds  using bulls.
Only 40% of herds achieved  a target  of 10 cwt. heifers  calving  at 24 
months. Repeat  breeding  was a problem  associated  with underweight  
heifers  (< 950 lbs) at calving. Difficult  calving  and retained  placentae  
were frequently  reported  as problems  but resulted  in very few sales.  
Repeat  breeding  in cows was a more serious  problem  in the summer  
than in the winter  and frequently  the affected  cow was sold.
Fertility  was lower on farms  using over 300 units nitrogen  per acre on 
silage  grass. The data do not show that this was a direct  effect.
Emphasis  on heat detection  was highly variable  and was correlated  
with the breeding  policy adopted.  There appears  to be considerable  
scope for improvement  in this area.
The data collected  indicates  that a more detailed  study into the 
individual  animal ’s fertility  is necessary  before  detailed  interactions  can 
be determined.

A COMPARISON  OF CONSTANT  RATE  AND VARIABLE  
CONCENTRATE  FEEDING  FOR DAIRY  COWS
P. A. GLEESON
Agricultural Institute,  Moorepark,  Fernioy,  Co. Cork.
Thirty Friesian  spring calving  dairy cows were allocated  to two 
experimental  treatments  :
(1) fed silage ad libitum  with 7.27 kg (109 kg for the group)  of a 16 
percent  crude protein  dairy ration  per head per day;
(2) fed silage ad libitum  and a total concentrate  allowance  to the group  
of 109 kg per day but allocated  to cows in relation  to milk yield.
Cows  were assigned  to treatment,  after a minimum  period  of three weeks  
post calving,  based on the milk yield of the last week of the preliminary  
period.
The mean  milk yields  for this final week were 22 kg (range 16.3-27.1  
for treatment  1 and 22.2 (range 16.4-27.6)  for 2. The mean lactation  
number  was 6.4 and 6.1 for treatments  1 and 2 respectively.  Concentrate  
feeding  levels for treatment  2 were adjusted  at weeks  2, 4 and 6 based 
on milk yields  of the two previous  weeks. The experimental  period  lasted 
8 weeks. Cows  were individually  housed  and offered  silage at 10 percent  
in excess  of daily intake,  all refusals  being recorded  daily. The daily  
concentrate  allowance  was fed in two equal feeds. Milk yields were  
recorded  5 days per week,  milk fat and protein  determined  once weekly  
and liveweight  were recorded  once weekly.
There  were no significant  differences  between  treatments  in milk yield, 
milk fat or protein  percentage.  Silage  intakes  were lower  on the variable  
concentrate  group and cows lost more liveweight.  Those  cows in treat ­
ment 2 receiving  the greatest  amount  of concentrates  had a much lower 
intake  (1.3% l.wt) than the cows on the lower concentrate  levels (1.6%  
l.wt). The results  indicate,  in the absence  of competition,  that variable  
rate feeding  has no advantage  over constant  rate feeding  for cows at the 
same stage of lactation.
EMBRYO  MORTALITY  IN THE COW  
M. G. DISKIN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
Reproductive  failure is one of the major factors  affecting  output  in 
either  the beef or dairy  cow herds. Although  it is generally  accepted  that 
fertilization  rates following  either natural  or artificial  insemination  are 
normally  close to 90%, calving  rates to a single insemination  are closer  
to 50%. While  most reports  demonstrate  the existence  and extent  of this 
embryonic  loss few of them indicate  the timing  at which  it occurs.
Studies  were carried  out to determine  the fertilization  and embryo  
survival  rates at various  stages  after insemination.
Fertilization  rate was estimated  at 90% following  the use of frozen- 
thawed  semen. However  the embryo  survival  rate at Day 42 was 52%.  
The extent  and timing  of this embryonic  loss was discussed.  Advances  in 
this area could contribute  significantly  to an increased  reproductive  rate.

INCREASING  THE CALVING  AND TWINNING  RATE  IN THE
BEEF  HERD
J. M. SREENAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam.  Co. Galway.
The recent  decline  in beef numbers  will have serious  repercussions  on 
beef output  over the next few years.  Expansion  in the dairy  herd sufficient  
to offset this reduction  is unlikely,  due to levelling  off of milk prices.  
Increasing  the number  of calves  born is now an urgent  necessity  for the 
beef industry.  Management  can play a major  role in determining  repro ­
ductive  rate and intensive  management  will shorten  the post partum  
interval  and increase  the conception  rate.
Over the past few years part of the research  programme  in cow 
fertility  at Belciare  has been devoted  to the induction  of twinning  as one 
possible  means of increasing  the national  calf crop with particular  re­
ferences  to single  suckler  herds.
Two aspects  of twinning  are being  examined  :
1. Twinning  by PMSG  (mild superovulation)
The production  of a low level of twinning  by administration  of PMSG  
at low doses 500-800  i.u. in conjunction  with heat synchronization.  
This has given a twinning  rate of 10% and a 15% increase  in the 
conception  rate.
2. Twinning  by embryo  transfer
This involves  the collection  of embryos  from donor cows and their  
transfer  non-surgically  to the contralateral  uterine horn of bred 
recipients.  Pregnancy  rates of 60% and a twinning  rate of 60% of 
pregnant  animals  were obtained.

THE EFFECT  OF MONENSIN  ON THE PERFORMANCE  OF
STORE  LAMBS
A. KINSELLA  and J. L. L’ESTRANGE  
Department  of Agriculture  Chemistry,  U.C.D.,  GUisnevin,  Dublin  9.
Monensin  (Rumensin),  used as a feed additive,  has been found to 
improve  the feed conversion  ratio (FCR) of beef animals  on a wide  
range of diets. This effect is thought  to be due to an alteration  of 
fermentation  in rumen fluid resulting  in increased  propionic  acid and 
decreased  acetic acid production.  In the experiments  reported  here, the 
effects  of Monensin  on the performance  of store lambs fattened  indoors  
were studied.
In experiment  1, forty-eight  Cheviot  ram lambs were fed a whole 
barley-based  concentrate  diet containing  0, 15, or 30 ppm Monensin,  fed 
ad libitum  with or without  a supplement  of long hay. Monensin  at both 
levels improved  live-weight  gain and FCR but not significantly  so. It 
significantly  increased  the proportion  of propionic  acid in the rumen  
fluid of the lambs,  while it decreased  the proportions  of acetic  and butyric  
acids. The response  to Monensin  was significantly  greater  when hay was 
supplemented.
In Experiment  2, which was a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial  design,  forty-eight  
Cheviot  ram lambs were fed a whole barley or a molassed  beet pulp- 
based concentrate  diet, containing  0 or 30 ppm Monensin  fed ad libitum,  
with or without  a supplement  of long hay. Feed intake,  live-weight  gain 
and FCR were significantly  better on the beet pulp than on the barley  
treatments.  However,  Monensin  did not improve  the performance  of the 
lambs  and had little effect  on rumen  fermentation.  There  was little effect  
also caused  by hay supplementation.

GRAZING  BEHAVIOUR  OF SHEEP  AND CATTLE  IN 
MIXED  GRAZING
T. NOLAN,  J. CONNOLLY  and M. dc RANCOURT  
Agricultural  Institute,  Creagh,  Ballinrohe,  Co. Mayo.
A three year experiment  showed  that mixed grazing  increased  in­
dividual  weaned  lamb and 1^-year  old steer liveweight  gains by 10 to 
30%. The benefit  to either  species  increased  as the proportion  in the mix 
decreased.  This experiment  attempted  to explain  the role of complemen ­
tary grazing  with particular  reference  to sheep grazing  ‘fouled ’ herbage  
(High  Grass)  around  the cattle  dung  pat areas  which  cattle refuse.
The results  show that on an area basis both cattle and sheep had 
marked  preferences  for High as opposed  to Low Grass in terms  of time 
spent grazing. The sheep preference  was generally  twice that of the 
cattle. On a DM basis cattle grazed High Grass in proportion  to the 
amount  of High Grass  DM present  and sheep  preference  continued  to be 
about  twice that of cattle.
Comparisons  at the beginning  and end of grazing  a paddock  showed  
that both cattle and sheep preferences  for High Grass increased  sig­
nificantly  with time on both an area and DM bases. The increase  was 
far greater  for area (about 206%)  than for DM (about 68%). Sheep 
preference  was twice that for cattle at the start and finish of grazing  and 
for an area and DM bases.
Results  for four time periods  showed  that on an DM basis cattle  
preference  for High Grass was significant  for the first period only and 
was less marked  as the grazing  season  advanced.  On an area basis  cattle  
had a marked  preference  for High Grass during all periods. Sheep 
preference  for High Grass  was significant  during  the first and last periods  
and exceeded  cattle preference  by a factor of about two on an area or 
DM basis.

EFFECTS  OF EWE PROLIFICACY  ON SHEEP  INCOME
S. FLANAGAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
The effects of crossing  Galway  sheep with very prolific  breeds on 
litter size have been reported  previously.  However,  there was a lack of 
recorded  information  on the financial  consequences  arising  from the use 
of new sheep breeds. Consequently,  at Blindwell  ewe performance  and 
income  were compared  in two breeds  of lowland  sheep which differ 
widely  in prolificacy.  The two breeds,  Galway  and Improved  Galway,  
were managed  under commercial  farm conditions  and under the one 
system  of husbandry.
Over the two years 1977 and 1978 the Improved  Galway  breed pro­
duced on average  0.3 more lambs per ewe lambing  compared  with the 
Galway.  The superiority  of the Improved  Galway  for lamb sales (£) per 
100 ewes to the ram amounted  to 30% on average  over the two years. 
Gross  margin  per ewe was improved  by over 45% when Improved  Gal­
way ewes were used instead  of Galway  ewes.
It is concluded  that large cash benefits  are feasible  when sheep 
breeding  research  results  are translated  into farm practice.

BREED  DIFFERENCES  IN THE RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  
EWE BODYWEIGHT  AND PRODUCTIVITY
J. P. HANRAHAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam,  Co, Galway.
It is well known that there is a positive  relationship  between  ewe 
liveweight  and fecundity  (litter size). Since most studies  on this topic  
have used ewes of low to moderate  fecundity  and future interest  will be 
in more prolific  breeds  it will be important  to know whether  bodyweight  
is more critical  with very prolific  ewes. Also, if breed differences  exist  
in the bodyweight/fecundity  relationship  this would  imply  different  cost/  
benefit  functions.  The data reported  relate  to analyses  of ewe bodyweight  
/ litter size relationships  in Galway,  J Finn, Fingalway  and High Fertility  
flocks  which are part of the sheep breeding  research  flocks  of The Agri ­
cultural  Institute.  In addition,  factors affecting  ewe bodyweight  have 
been examined  in 15 pedigree  Galway  flocks  over two years. The within  
flock relationships  between  ewe bodyweight  and litter size and lamb  
growth  rate pre-weaning  have also been examined.  Bodyweight  in all 
cases refers  to weight  at the time of mating  (October).
The major  difference  between  the genetic  groups  studied  is in fecun ­
dity. The average  litter sizes (1972-1978)  were 1.4, 1.7, 2.0 and 2.0 for 
Galway,  i Finn,  Fingalway  and High Fertility,  respectively.  The relation ­
ship between  bodyweight  and litter size was examined  graphically  for 
each breed group  and 2-tooth  ewes were treated  separately.  For mature  
ewes the results  show a pronounced  breed difference  with essentially  no 
relationship  in the Fingalway  and High Fertility groups  and a pronounced  
positive  relationship  in the Galway  and Finn groups. In the case of 
2-tooth  ewes all breeds  showed  a positive  relationship  at low weights  but 
there was an apparent  plateau at higher weights  for the two high 
fecundity  breed groups.
The pattern  of relationships  seen for litter size were also evident  for 
ovulation  rate but the volume  of data was much smaller.
For pedigree  Galway  ewes the within-flock  regression  of litter size 
on bodyweight  (kg) was 0.012  + 0.003 in the 1974/75  data set and 0.011  + 
0.()04 in the 1975/76  data set. The relationship  between  lamb average  
daily gain and ewe bodyweight  was not significant  for the 1974/75  data 
set (0.0001+0.0004)  but was highly significant  in the second data set 
(0.()012±0.0003).  Flock  differences  accounted  for approximately  50% of 
variation  in age-adjusted  bodyweight.  Single-born  ewes were heavier  
than multiple  born ewes at all ages; the average  difference  was 2.8 kg. 
Ewe bodyweight  was also influenced  by litter size in the previous  spring  
—ewes which  produced  singles  were heavier  at weighing  in October  than 
ewes which produced  multiples.  This effect however  depended  on ewe 
age and flock.
Breed differences  in the ewe bodyweight/litter  size relationship  sug­
gest that bodyweight  at mating  is less critical  in highly  prolific  ewes with 
consequent  savings  on inputs  at this time which  may yield a higher  return  
at around  lambing  time.
CONTRIBUTIONS  TO IMPROVED  SOW PRODUCTION
N. WALKER
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of N. Ireland.  Hillsborough.  Co. Down.
Rearing  more bonhams  per sow per year invariably  increases  profits. 
Production  can commence  earlier  by mating  gilts at puberty  rather  than 
at a later oestrus  and is likely  to produce  more pigs per unit time. Puberty  
can be advanced  slightly  with various  stimuli  but does not appear  to be 
retarded  by rearing  gilts with contemporary  boars.
The frequency  with which  mature  boars  are used for mating  has some  
effect on litter size.
Re-establishing  pregnancy  in the weaned  sow, especially  after the 
first parity,  is an aspect  of management  where improvements  are often  
possible.  The social stimulus  of group-housing  newly-weaned  sows was 
not beneficial  under  our conditions.  However,  exogenous  hormone  given  
on the day of weaning  to primiparous  sows reduced  the mean time to 
conception  and increased  subsequent  litter size. Confirmation  of preg­
nancy  has been tested  with a commercial  ultrasonic  device  which,  together  
with vaginal  biopsy  data,  suggests  that the incidence  of pregnancies  which 
are terminated  around  mid-gestation  may warrant  further  consideration.
A comparison  of weaning  ages of 10, 25 or 40 days showed  that 
maximum  sow production  on a herd basis was achieved  with 10 day 
weaning.
It has been suggested  that lactating  sows have a latent heat three  
weeks  post partum  and that early-weaning  prior to this will result in a 
shorter  time to conception.  Our evidence  does not support  this thesis.  
Regardless  of weaning  age the productivity  of a sow herd is dominated  
by first and second  parity animals  and in particular  by the size of their  
litters.
The number  of pigs born per litter should  be increased  by all possible 
means  since it is now becoming  possible  to identify  the rearing  capabil ­
ities of the sow and to rear ‘surplus ’ piglets  artificially.

EFFECTS  OF PHYSICAL  FORM  OF DIET  AND  DIETARY  LEVEL  
OF SKIM  MILK  POWDER  ON PERFORMANCE  OF PIGS  
WEANED  AT 2-3 WEEKS  OF AGE
D. C. PATTERSON
Af^riciiltitral  Research  Institute  of N. Ireland,  HiUshorouf ’h, Co. Down.
A total of 180 pigs weaned  within 13-19 days of age, of 4.7 kg mean  
initial liveweight  and penned  in groups  of 6 were assigned  to a 3 x 2 
factorial  experiment  in which three physical  forms of starter  diet were 
each followed  by two physical  forms of grower  diet. The forms of 
starter  diet were pellets  (4.75 mm diam.),  ground  meal and flaky meal.  
The flaky form was created  by omitting  to grind the flaked  maize which 
was present  in the starter  diets at a level of 200 g/kg. The forms of 
grower  diet were pellets  (4.75 mm diam.)  and ground  meal. The change  
from starter to grower  occurred  at 12.5 kg liveweight  with both diets  
given  ad libitum.  Meal diets gave a higher  liveweight  gain from weaning  
to 12.5 kg liveweight  but the difference  between  the meal and pellet  forms  
was small during  the 12.5 to 25 kg liveweight  stage. Pelleted  diets gave 
superior  conversion  ratios during  both stages. The flaky meal form of 
the starter  diet gave a slightly  slower  growth  rate than the ground  meal 
form from weaning  to 12.5 kg liveweight.
In a 4 X 3 X 2 factorial  experiment  four levels of skim milk powder  
in the starter  diet were combined  with three times  of changeover  to the 
grower  diet and two levels  of skim milk powder  in the grower  diet. The 
levels of skim milk powder  in the starter  diets were 0, 100, 200 and 300 
g/kg,  the changeover  times  were 7, 14 and 21 days post-weaning  and the 
levels  of skim milk powder  in the grower  diet were 0 and 100 g/kg. All 
diets were offered  ad libitum.  Ninety-six  pigs weaned  at 19-22 days of 
age were allocated  to the experiment.  The greater  the skim milk content  
of the starter  diet the higher  the rate of liveweight  gain and the lower  the 
feed conversion  ratio. With each incremental  change  of 100 g skim milk 
powder  per kg starter  diet daily liveweight  gain increased  by about 17 
g/day  and feed conversion  ratio improved  by 0.03 units. The pigs grew  
faster when skim milk was included  in the grower  diet but there was no 
consistent  response  to variations  in the time when the starter  diet was

FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE EFFICIENCY  OF FEED  
UTILIZATION  IN PIGS
T. J. HANRAHAN
Agriculiural  Institute.  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
This experiment  was designed  to assess  the effect  of diet form on feed 
utilization  efficiency.  The Moorepark  standard  diet fed in meal form 
(control),  pelleted,  or with 2% added fat were compared.  Digestibility  
studies indicated  that the meal, pelleted,  and 2% fat diets contained  
3.035, 3.007 and 3.085 Meal D.E./kg  respectively.  The slightly  lower 
digestible  energy  content  of the pellets  corresponded  with their lower  dry 
inatter  and suggests  that pelleting  does not improve  the digestibility  of 
diets. The feeding  trial involved  576 pigs penned  in groups  of 16 and 
housed  in a conventional  type building  which was naturally  wentilated,  
with temperature  maintained  around  2 PC. All pens had a 1.83 meter  
feed hopper  and an ad libitum  supply  of water. Sufficient  feed to last a 
six hour feeding  period  was allocated  each morning.  Pigs fed the pelleted  
and fat supplemented  diets had feed utilization  efficiencies  5% and 2% 
respectively  better than the meal fed pigs. The improved  efficiency  on 
the fat supplemented  diet is no more than expected  from the digestibility  
data whereas  the pelleted  diet performed  above expectation.  This sug­
gests considerable  wastage  of feed in the case of the meal and fat 
supplemented  diets. Visable  feed wastage  was not observed.

Influence  of Pasture  Type on 
Animal  Production
V. CONNOLLY
Agricultural  Institute.  Oakpark,  Carlow.
The influence  of pasture  type on animal  production  has been the subject  
of much research  and debate  for many years. There  are some aspects  on 
which there is general  agreement.  For example,  pastures  with a good 
white  clover  balance  are more productive  than those without  this legume.  
In Ireland  and U.K. the more productive  pastures  have reasonably  high 
levels of ryegrass.  There is much less agreement  on other aspects  such 
as the relative  merits  of different  varieties  of ryegrass.  Differences  be­
tween ryegrass  varieties  in terms  of dry matter  yield under frequent  and 
infrequent  cutting  are well established.  There is, however,  no reliable  
way in which productivity  under cutting  can be translated  into animal  
performance.
The results  presented  in this paper  deal with the relative  performance  
of four varieties  of ryegrass  measured  in terms  of animal  production  over 
a period  of six years. Three stocking  rates were imposed  on each of the 
four varieties  as follows  :
Varieties :
— Tailteann : Early Poor persistency
— S24 : Early Good persistency
— S23 Late Good persistency
— Reveille
Stocking  rates : (at 
— Low 
— Medium  - High: Early
turn-out) kg/ha
2,000
2,500
3,000Tertaploid,  medium  
persistency
In such experiments  it is necessary  to include  varying  stocking  levels 
in order to arrive at valid conclusions.  This is the reason  for the very 
high stocking  rates which  severely  depress  animal  performance.
The level of nitrogen  fertiliser  use was 245 kg/ha/annum  in five 
applications.  The duration  of the grazing  season  was from the first week 
of April to the first week  of November  and the grazing  cycle  was 20 days. 
Stocking  rates were reduced  by 45% in July after five grazing  cycles.
Results
Liveweight  gain from each variety  averaged  over stocking  rates for 
each year is shown  in Table  I. Productivity  was high. On the best treat ­
ments  (Reveille  and S 23 medium  stocking  rate) production  was never

less than 1100 kg/ha  liveweight  gain in any year. The first year (1975)  
showed  a very high level of production,  this is a phenomenon  frequently  
associated  with new re-seeds  where  the performance  in the initial  year is 
some 10-20%  higher  than in subsequent  seasons.
Differences  between  varieties  are summarised  in Table 2 in terms of 
carrying  capacity  relative  to S 24 = 100.

The main features  of these results  are :
S 23 and Reveille  were consistently  superior  in stock carrying  capacity  
to S24 and Tailteann  was poorer  than S 24 except  in the first harvest  year. 
The degree  of superiority  of S 23 and Reveille  over the whole season  is 
about 10% relative  to S 24 and about 16% relative  to Tailteann.  Dry 
matter  yield data over a period  of two years  obtained  by frequent  cutting  
of these four varieties  in a separate  experiment  are presented  in Table 3.
These  results  show that dry matter  yield as measured  by cutting  is not 
a good guide to animal  performance.
Seasonal  differences
The varieties  showed  large differences  in seasonal  production  and 
these are summarised  in Table 4. The grazing  season  was divided  into 
two periods  ; (1) April to July and (2) July to end of October.

♦ In 1975 Period  1 =80 days; stocking  rate was reduced  after four cycles  of grazing  
because  of drought  conditions.
Future capital  developments  include  the erection  of extra cubicles 
for beef cattle,  installation  of cubicles  in hayshed  for extra yearlings  and 
the extension  of the slatted  area for wintering  sheep.
These results  show that the stock carrying  capacity  of the tetraploid  
in the first period relative  to all other varieties  was very high. It is of 
interest  to note that S 23 (a late variety)  is better than S 24 (an early  
variety)  in this period  (with the exception  of 1975 when the duration  of 
Period  1 was shorter  than usual). This was due to two factors:
(1) Period  1 covers  the peak production  of all varieties;
(2) S 24 is not nearly  as good in terms of animal  production  in this 
early  period  as would  be expected  on the basis  of dry matter  yield  
data.
S 23 and Reveille  produced  similar  total annual  liveweight  gains and 
the differences  between  these two varieties  were mainly  seasonal. The 
seasonal  pattern  of growth  of these two varieties  is shown  in Fig. 1. The 
major disadvantage  of S 23 is low production  in the first 60 days after  
turn out while the main weakness  of Reveille  is low production  in the 
July/August  period.
Another  aspect  of seasonal  productivity  is summarised  in Table  5. This 
shows the proportion  of the total annual liveweight  gain which was 
obtained  in the period  April  - July (100 days). The results  demonstrate  
the degree to which production  is concentrated  into this early period. 
Even for a late variety  such as S 23, 75% or more of the total annual  
potential  liveweight  gain is obtained  at this time.

Although  the performance  of S 23 was superior  to the other varieties  
from mid-July  onwards,  the carrying  capacity  of all swards  during  this 
second  part of the grazing  season  was low. The stocking  rate reduction  
of 45% which  was made at this time was not great enough  to maintain  
liveweight  per animal  at a level comparable  to that of Period 1 at all 
stocking  levels.
Persistency
Table  6 summarises  the persistency  levels  of the four varieties.  These  
results  were based  on dry matter  yield of the sward  components.
As expected  S 23 showed  the highest  persistency  level. The tetraploid  
varieties  are generally  reputed  to have low persistency  levels. These  data 
show that Reveille  persisted  well at all stocking  rates and was equal to 
the values  obtained  for S 24.

Summary
The data collected  over six years show  that pasture  type as influenced  
by the sown  variety  has an effect  on animal  output. The results  obtained  
here are restricted  to a high nitrogen  input system. In a low nitrogen  
system where greater reliance  would be placed on clover then the 
superiority  of S 23 is likely to decrease  but the tetraploid  would very 
likely  retain  its position  because  it is compatible  with good clover  growth.  
The results  emphasise  the high animal  output  capacity  of some of the 
new tetraploid  varieties. The data refer specifically  to the earlier  tetra ­
ploid perennial  varieties  such as Reveille.  Greater  use of such tetraploids  
in mixtures  designed  primarily  for grazing  or one silage cut plus grazing  
would  seem desirable.

A Demonstration  of High  Beef Output  
on a Conimereial  Farm
E. NAUGHTON  
Moyliss,  Roscommon.
A. KILCLINE
Committee  of Agriculture,  Roscommon
In 1974 a three year trial was initiated  for the purpose  of demonstrating  
the effects  of stocking  rate on beef output  per acre. The trial was under ­
taken on part of E. Naughton ’s farm, in co-operation  with the Advisory  
Service  and Department  of Agriculture.
The farm consists  of 138 adjusted  acres and the soil type is a heavy 
brown  earth suitable  for all livestock  and tillage  enterprises.  Tradition ­
ally the farm in common  with other farms  in the vicinity  was an extensive 
dry stock/sheep  enterprise  farm. Fertilizer  application  has been increased  
over the past 10 years and pH and soil fertility  is currently  being main ­
tained  at a high level.
Layout  of trial
Cattle  were stocked  on the allocated  areas at three different  levels up 
to July when the stocking  rates were reduced  for the remainder  of the 
grazing  season. The details  were as follows :

Fertilizers
A basal dressing  of 3 cwt. 0.10.20  per ace was applied  in November.  
Application  of nitrogen  fertilizer  consisted  of;
2 cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all plots on March  1 
1 cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all plots in June/July  
1^ cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all ‘High ’ plots in July 
1 cwt. 26% Net nitrate  on all plots in August/September
Results
Liveweight  gains per animal  and per acre are summarised  in Tables  
1 and 2. The results show that whilst the greatest  liveweight  gain per 
animal  was achieved  on the medium  stocking  rate, the highest  gain per 
acre was obtained  on the high stocking  rate.

It is concluded  that intensive  stocking  is feasible  on this farm, which  
is representative  of the surrounding  area, and that there is potential  for a 
much  greater  volume  of beef output  per acre than that achieved  in tradi ­
tional practice. To realise this objective,  the following  management  
details  are essential ;
1. Rest pasture  during  winter.
2. Maintain  soil fertility.
3. Apply  N fertilizer  six weeks  before  initial  grazing.
4. Good grass swarth  at time of cattle turnout.
5. Good  fencing  and water  supply.
12
6. Rest paddocks  before  grazing.
7. Control  of fluke and worms.
Farm development  plan
The development  plan, using  experience  gained  from the stocking  rate 
trial, is aimed  at extending  a high stocking  rate over the whole  farm. The 
development  is phased  as follows :

The targets  include  the production  of 85 beef cattle from weanling  
purchased  18 months  earlier,  the maintenance  of 160 ewes by 1981 and a 
tillage  rotation  to provide  the opportunity  for establishing  high yielding 
pastures.
For servicing  this expansion  in stock numbers  the following  capital  
programme  has been implemented :
• erection  of feeding,  housing  and slurry accommodation  for 60 
fattening  cattle;
• cubicles,  silo and slurry  pit for 30 weanlings;
• covered  slats for 100 ewes;
• farm roadway.

Reducing  Winter  Feed Costs  
in Beef Production
M. DRENNAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
The three most important  factors  which determine  the profitability  of 
fattening  cattle in winter  are;
1. Total feed costs.
2. Animal  performance.
3. The autumn  to spring  cattle price increase.
The total non-feed  cost of keeping  a fattening  animal  for a 140 day 
winter  period  will vary with circumstances  but for the present  discussion  
a figure of £55 is taken. Included  in this cost are total interest  charges,  
repayments  on building  and other overhead  costs,  transport  and market ­
ing, mortality  and dosing  costs. It is appreciated  that these costs may be 
substantially  lower in many instances  particularly  when repayments  on 
buildings  do not apply.
Cattle  price increases  are likely  to make smaller  contributions  to pro­
fits in the coming  years than in the recent  past and thus more emphasis  
will need to be placed  on feed costs and animal  performance.  The effects  
of these two factors  on returns  are shown in Table 1 where the price  
increase  is taken at only £5 per 100 kg. Using  this price increase  a daily  
gain of 0.7kg per day is required  in order to break-even  when total feed 
costs are as low as £50 for a 140 day winter  period. The data show that 
high rate of gain and low feed costs are very important  if profitability  is 
to be maximised.

Chemical  treatment  of straw
Methods  have been developed  whereby  the feeding  value of straw  
can be improved  by treating  it with a chemical.  Both sodium  hydroxide  
and ammonia  treatment  methods  have been investigated  at Grange  but
15
no data are available  on the latter method  with fattening  animals. The 
results  of a trial in which  fattening  bulls (400 kg initially)  were fed 5 kg 
concentrates  (75% barley, 23% soyabean  and 2% minerals/vitamins)  
per head daily and either untreated  or sodium  hydroxide  treated  barley  
straw  to appetite  is shown  in Table  2.

Livewt.  gain (kg) (187 days) 155 161
Carcass  gain (kg) 83 104
Daily straw DM intake (kg) 5.3 5.6
Although  there were only small differences  between  treatments  in live- 
weight gains the killing-out  percentages  of animals  fed the sodium 
hydroxide  treated  straw were significantly  greater  than when untreated  
straw was fed. Thus over 187-day  feeding  period  carcass  weight  gains 
of animals  fed untreated  and treated  straws  were 85 and 104 kg respec ­
tively. Daily straw  dry matter  intakes  were 5.3 and 5.6 kg for untreated  
and treated  material  respectively.  The dry matter  digestibility  of untreated  
and treated  straws  were 45 and 61% respectively.  While  digestibility  was 
improved  as a result of treatment  it should be noted that the final 
material  was of relatively  low feeding  value. When  the cost of treatment  
(about  £20 per tonne of straw)  and the increased  straw intake are con­
sidered  the increased  gain from treatment  is only about  sufficient  to meet 
the added  costs.
Fodder  beet roots
A number  of experiments  have been carried  out in which pulped  
fodder  beet roots were compared  with barley as a supplement  to grass 
silage for fattening  cattle. The silages  were fed to appetite  in each ex­
periment  and were in general  of high digestibility  and properly  preserved.
In six experiments,  silage was fed alone to one group  of animals  and 
a second  group  was fed supplementary  barley  (2^ kg in four experiments  
and 5.0 kg in the other two experiments)  with silage. Other treatment  
groups  received  a similar  level of supplementary  dry matter  as an alter ­
native to barley  either as fodder  beet alone or as fodder  beet/soyabean  
meal. A summary  of these experiments  is presented  in Tables  3 and 4. 
The results  show that when fodder  beet alone was fed the extra carcass  
produced  was only 57 percent  of that obtained  from a similar  level of 
supplementary  barley  dry matter. However,  as a supplement  to silage, 
fodder  beet/soyabean  meal gave additional  carcass  gains which were 91

that the depression  in silage intake from the same quantity  of supple ­
mentary  dry matter  was the same for the various  supplements.
Molasses
At present  prices  molasses  is a relatively  cheap  feed when compared  
with barley  as a supplement  for fattening  animals  fed high quality  silage.  
For the purpose  of the comparisons  molasses  was assumed  to have an 
energy  value 70 percent  of that in barley.  The supplements  fed with silage  were :
(1) 3.0 kg rolled barley.
(2) 4.3 kg molasses.
(3) 3.6 kg molasses  plus 0.45 kg soyabean  meal.
The results  in Table 5 show that when additional  protein  was pro­
vided as soyabean  meal the supplement  of molasses  gave carcass  gains  
similar  to that obtained  from barley.

In order to examine  the possible  role of fodder  beet, molasses  and 
treated  straw in rations  for fattening  cattle, diets based on these feeds  
are compared.  The usable yields and production  costs of the various  
crops are shown  in Table  6.

This table shows that the high yield of fodder  beet per acre offsets  the 
higher  production  costs compared  with barley  and grass silage resulting  
in similar  costs per unit of feed energy  for the three crops. Three  diets  
using different  supplements  with silage  calculated  to produce  a daily gain 
of 0.9 kg per day in fattening  cattle  are presented  in Table  7.

A fourth  diet based on sodium  hydroxide  treated  straw (5.5 kg per day) 
and 5.5 kg concentrates  (78% barley,  20% soyabean  meal,  2% minerals/  
vitamins)  per animal  daily is compared  with these in Table  8 in terms  of 
feed costs and acres required  per 100 cattle  for a 140-day  feeding  period.

Using  diet A (based  on silage  and purchased  barley)  as standard,  feed 
costs per animal  is reduced  by £9.50 per head as a result of replacing  
purchased  barley  by molasses/soyabean  meal (diet B). The land require ­
ments  are similar  for diets A and B. While  the diet based  on fodder  beet 
is the most attractive,  it must be remembered  that production  costs are 
high and these results  are dependent  on high yields per acre. Although  
the diet based on treated  straw and concentrates  is only slightly  more  
expensive  than diet A the acreage  required  is increased  by almost  50 
percent  as all feed except  soyabean  meal is home produced  and per acre 
production  from barley  is low.
The data illustrate  the importance  of (a) obtaining  high yields  of high 
quality  inaterial  with home produced  feed and (b) the feed cost per unit 
of digestible  energy  with purchased  feeds.
Level  of barley  feeding  with silage
The optimum  level of barley for fattening  cattle fed silage depends  
on a number  of factors. To estimate  this level a brief summary  of feed­
ing experiments  carried  out at Grange  is now presented  and economic  
returns  are calculated,  using various  winter cattle price increases  and 
barley  prices.

The data presented  in Table  9 are the average  results  from a number  
of experiments  in which  cattle  were fed grass silage  alone  or with different  
levels of supplementary  barley. The responses  from feeding  1.8 and 3.6 
kg of barley  per animal  daily were then calculated  and adjusted  to a 140- 
day feeding  period. The responses  are shown  in Table 10.

Liveweight ■ 7.0 15.1
Carcass  weight 10.9 20.0
The average  daily liveweight  gain of animals  fed silage  alone  was 0.57 
kg which  demonstrates  that moderate  to high quality  silages  were used in 
these studies. When calculated  over a 140-day  feeding  period,  animals  
fed 1.8 and 3.6 kg barley  daily gained  23 and 36 kg more carcass  weight 
than those  fed silage  alone. Feeding  1.8 and 3.6 kg barley  daily depressed  
silage  intakes  by 10.0 and 18.5 percent  respectively.  A good response  in 
terms of animal  performance  was obtained  from feeding  the first 1.8 kg 
of barley  daily but increasing  the levels of supplementation  from 1.8 to 
3.6 kg resulted  in a major decline  in the liveweight  and carcass  weight 
responses  to supplementation.

Selling  price (£/100 kg) 75 80

From these results,  the financial  returns  were calculated  for a farm  
example  involving  a winter  feeding  period  of 140-days  where  600 tonnes  
silage  are available.  The number  of cattle  (400 kg initially)  which  can be 
carried  for 140 days is 100, 111 and 123 where  0, 1.8 and 3.6 kg of barley 
are fed respectively.
In order  to place the returns  to barley  feeding  in their proper  prospec ­
tive, the financial  returns  from feeding  silage alone are shown  in Table  
11 using various  purchase  and selling prices. As used here, financial 
return  means  the difference  between  the sale price of animals  and cost of 
animals,  housing,  dosing  etc., including  the interest  on money  invested 
in these items where this is applicable.  A charge  for labour  is not in­
cluded  in the costs. This table shows that when silage only is fed, a 
winter  cattle price increase  of £8 to £9 per 100 kg. is required  to break ­
even. The price increase  required  to break-even  would  be greater  at lower
20
levels  of production.  The extra returns  obtained  from feeding  1.8 and 3.6 
kg of barley  per head daily with silage  are shown  in Table 12 when  barley  
is charged  at £105 per tonne.

Purchase  price £80 per 100 kg
The extra returns  from meal feeding  is the difference  between  that 
obtained  when barley  is fed and that obtained  when silage alone is fed. 
No charge  is made for additional  housing  where  extra cattle are carried  
as a result of meal feeding  because  it is assumed  that adequate  housing  
is available.
Although  feed costs per animal  are £43, £65 and £88 where  0, 1.8 and 
3.6 kg of barley are fed respectively  economic  returns  are improved  in 
all instances  from barley  feeding.  This improvement  in returns  illustrates  
the importance  of the increased  rates of gain obtained  from feeding  
barley. The optimum  level of barley  depends  on the cattle  price increase,  
with 3.6 kg only proving  as economical  as 1.8 kg when  the price increase  
is over £5 per 100 kg. However,  if barley  is charged  at £125 per tonne  
(Table 13) an extremely  high price increase  is required  in order  to justify  
the feeding  of 3.6 kg barley  per animal  daily.

10 1579 1245
Purchase  price £80 per 100 kg
This shows  that the cost of barley  becomes  increasingly  important  as the 
level of barley  feeding  is increased.  As interest  charges  are included  in 
the cost of barley and considering  the expected  price for finished  cattle
21
in spring  the optimum  level of barley  will be about 1.8 kg in many  cases.  
It should be noted however  that the above figures  do not include  the 
advantages  expected  from growth  promoters  which  substanially  improve 
returns  in all instances  as shown  in Table 14.

In this table it is assumed  that returns  are improved  by £20 per animal  
as a result  of the growth  promoters.
Conclusions
Apart from cattle price increases  the most important  factors  to con­
sider in obtaining  good returns  from winter  fattening  are :
1. High animal  performance.
2. High yields per acre of high quality  material  as illustrated  by fodder  
beet.
3. Low  cost per unit of feed energy  for purchased  feeds.

The Use of Growth  Promoters  
in Beef Cattle
J. F. ROCHE
Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Growth  rate of animals  is affected  by many factors  such as previous  and 
present  plane of nutrition,  sex of animal,  breed,  environment,  season  and 
health  status. Bulls will grow faster than steers,  steers grow faster than 
heifers  and removal  of the ovaries  from heifers  further  depresses  growth  
rate. The effects  of sex on growth  rate are mediated  through  hormonal  
effects.
Because  of the known  effects of hormones  on growth  rate, various  
growth  promoting  implants  have been developed.  These  can be classified 
generally  as follows :
1. Oestrogens —female sex hormone —the manufacture,  preparation,  
packing  or sale of any animal  remedy  containing  oestrogen  to which  
the regulations  apply  is prohibited,  save under  licence  of the Minister  
for Agriculture.  Synovex-S  is the most common  one used in the U.K.  
This product  contains  progesterone  and oestradiol  and it has recently  
become  available  commercially  in Ireland,  through  veterinary  sur­
geons.
2. Androgens —male  sex hormones —these are similar  in action to tes­
tosterone  which is present  in bulls and trenbolone  acetate  (Finaplix)  
is the one most commonly  used.
3. Non-hormonal  compounds— simple  chemicals —affect  growth  rate and 
resorcylic  acid lactone  (Ralgro)  is the most common  one used in this 
category.
The commercially  available  growth  promoters  in Ireland  at present  
are shown  in Table 1.
Side effects
Ralgro  or Finaplix  have shown  no undesirable  side effects  following 
use, such as abnormal  behaviour,  raised  tail head, lactation  in males  etc. 
If Finaplix  was repeatedly  used, it is possible  that some male behavioural  
characteristics  would  develop.  These  two compounds  when used properly  
are safe to animal  and man.
Some side effects  have been reported  on the use of growth  promoters  
containing  oestrogens  (Synovex)  such as increase  in mounting,  riding,  in­
creased  aggression  and raised  tail heads. At time of insertion  of implants,  
it is important  that they are not crushed  or inserted  on wet days because  
there can be a greater  release  rate from the implant  resulting  in worse  
problems.  In addition,  it is important  not to mix implanted  cattle with 
strange  cattle  as this can trigger  off fresh behavioural  problems.

Mechanism  of action
Growth  promoters  generally  increase  tissue growth  and particularly  
muscle  growth  at the expense  of fat. There  appear  to be different  mechan ­
isms of action.
(i) Direct action of the compound  in the target tissue. The hormone  
binds  to a receptor  in the cell, thereby  initiating  a series  of reactions  
which  result in increases  in DNA  synthesis.  Androgens  work in this 
fashion  (Finaplix).
(ii) Indirect  action  on the brain and pituitary  gland  resulting  in increased  
release  of growth  hormone.  Growth  hormone  then acts on target  
tissue as just described  to increase  protein  synthesis.  Ralgro  and 
oestrogens  appear  to work in this manner.
The net result  is an increase  in nitrogen  retention  in the tissue  and a 
decrease  in urinary  excretion  rate of nitrogen. Thus, these com­
pounds  work  more  by increasing  efficiency  of conversion  of food into 
muscle  than by increasing  feed intake.
Use of either  compound  once
It is claimed  that either Ralgro  or Finaplix  will increase  growth  rate 
and feed efficiency  in animals  on pasture  or fed on roughage  and con­
centrate  diets. Experiments  have been carried  out at Grange  and Ballina-  
lack on finishing  steers and results  to date for Ralgro  are summarized  in 
Table 2 and for Finaplix  in Table 3. Ralgro  significantly  increased  the 
mean liveweight  gain. There was variation  in liveweight  gain from trial 
to trial of the order of 0 to 20% increase  with an average  increase  of 
10%. Carcass  weight  was also increased  by a mean  of 7 kg. over controls.

Experiments  with Finaplix  show no significant  increase  in liveweight

14% increase  over controls.  Likewise,  mean  carcass  weight  was increased  
by 6 kg. over controls  in these trials.

Repeated  use of Ralgro
Trials were carried  out to determine  if a second  implant  of Ralgro  
60 days after the first will give a further  increase  in performance.  Five 
hundred  and sixteen  animals  on four farms, mainly  Friesian  X, were 
allocated  to three groups : (1) untreated,  (2) Ralgro  at start of experiment  
and (3) Ralgro  at start and repeated  after 60 days. The minimum  length  
of treatment  on any farm was 130 days.

There  was variation  from farm to farm but from the above  results  in 
Table 4 it does not appear  worthwhile  to re-use Ralgro  60 days after 
the first implantation.  Whether  or not a response  would be obtained  to 
the second  implant  if a longer  interval  was used has not been tested.
Trials were carried  out in the winter  of 1975 on 815 finishing  beef 
steers  fed on silage and concentrates  to determine  if either  implant  alone  
or if both together  would  affect daily liveweight  gain and carcass  weight.  
The animals  were allocated  at random  into four groups :
Group 1; Untreated  controls.
Group  2: Ralgro  given  at start of experiment.
Group  3: Finaplix  given  about  30 days after start of experiment.  
Group  4: Combination  treatment  of Ralgro  initially  followed  by Fina ­
plix in about  30 days.
Animals  were weighed  throughout  the experiment  and the mean and 
daily liveweight  gains are given  in Table  5. Either  growth  promoter  alone  
gave a significant  increase  in growth  rate. The combination  treatment  
gave a further  additive  increase  in growth  rate over either  compound  used 
alone and this was significant.  Carcass  weights  were available  for 596 
animals  on two farms and the mean carcass  weights  for groups 1, 2, 3 
and 4 respectively  were 310 ± 2.05, 319 ± 2.01, 316 ± 2.01 and 328 ± 2.04. 
Animals  on the first farm were slaughtered  after 98 days and after 135 
days on the second  farm. Again  significant  increases  in carcass  weights 
over ‘controls ’ for either compound  were obtained  and the combination  
treatment  gave a further  significant  increase.

Can Ralgro  and Finaplix  be inserted  on the same day ?
A trial was conducted  to determine  whether  it was necessary  when 
using the combination  of Ralgro  and Finaplix  to wait 30 days before
28
inserting  Finaplix.  There were 423 animals  on two farms allocated  at 
random  to 3 groups :
(1) Control  group.
(2) Implanted  with Ralgro  at start of experiment  followed  in about 30 
days by Finaplix.
(3) Implanted  with both Ralgro  and Finaplix  at start of the experiment.  
There  was a significant  (P<0.01)  increase  in final liveweight  and daily
liveweight  gain of steers treated  with growth  promoters  compared  with 
controls  (Table 6). Animals  were slaughtered  after mean duration  of 
132 days. There was also a significant  (P<0.001)  increase  in carcass  
weight  of treated  steers  compared  with controls.  There  was no difference 
in final liveweight  gain or carcass  weight  for steers receiving  both com­
pounds  on the same or different  days. Thus, both compounds  can be 
inserted  on the same day and still get the same effect as inserting  them  
30 days apart.

Repeated  use of Ralgro  and Finaplix
A trial was carried  out to determine  if re-implanting  steers  65-70  days 
later with Ralgro  and Finaplix  further  increased  growth  rate compared  
to steers  given the combination  treatment  once. There  were 453 animals  
on three farms  allocated  at random  to three  groups :
(i) Control.
(ii) Implanted  with Ralgro  and Finaplix  at start of experiment.
(iii) Implanted  with Ralgro  and Finaplix  at start of experiment  and re­
implanted  with Ralgro  and Finaplix  65-70  days later.
Re-implantation  65-70  days after initial implantation  significantly  in­
creased  final liveweight,  daily liveweight  gain and carcass  weight  com­
pared to steers given the combination  treatment  once (Table 7). This 
treatment  should  only be considered  where  animals  are being kept for at 
least 130 days and are on a high plane of nutrition  from start of treat ­
ment.

Effectiveness  at pasture
The purpose  of the next experiment  was to determine  whether  results 
being achieved  on silage and concentrates  over the winter  months  could 
be obtained  when animals  were on pasture.  At the start of the experi ­
ment,  all implants  were inserted  into the base of the ear.
Either growth promoter  when used alone significantly  (P <; 0.05)  
increased  final liveweight  and daily liveweight  gain (Table  8). Resorcylic  
acid significantly  (P < 0.01) increased  carcass  weight but trenbolone  
acetate  did not. The reason  for this discrepancy  is not clear. The use of 
both growth  promoters  again gave significant  (P<0.01)  increase  in final 
liveweight,  daily liveweight  gain and carcass  weight  compared  either  with 
both compounds  used alone or compared  with performance  of control  
steers.

In contrast  to the results  in steers,  the results  in heifers  or cull cows  
are not as clear and can be summarized  as follows :
(1) Marginal  response  obtained.

(2) Ralgro  and Finaplix  not additive.
(3) Finaplix  is the implant  recommended.
(4) Monensin  could  also be considered  for use as a feed additive.
Use in calves  and weanlings
Ralgro  is the growth  promoter  one would consider  using in calves. 
Two trials have been carried  out to date in uncastrated  calves  from 3-5 
months  of age. Calves  in Trial 1 were Friesian  bull calves  while  those in 
Trial 2 were multiple  suckled  Friesian  or Charolais  cross animals. The 
liveweight  gain of control  and Ralgro  treated  animals  respectively  were
57.5 ± 1.9, 60.9 ± 1.9 in Trial 1 and 89.7 + 1.9 and 86.6 ± 1.9 in Trial 2. 
No increase  in daily liveweight  gain was obtained  in these  trials  with bull 
calves. However,  in other trials with steer calves  we have got a 10-15%  
increase  in growth  rate in calves varying  in age from ten days to four 
months.

One trial has been carried out in Ballinalack  on 8-9 month old 
Friesian  bulls with Ralgro. Animals  were allocated  at random  to two 
groups  of 26 each : (1) untreated  control  and (2) treated  with Ralgro.  
The initial and final liveweights  after 88 days were 189 and 222 kg. for 
control  weanlings  and 191 and 225 kg. for weanlings  given Ralgro.  From  
these limited  trials with uncastrated  calves or weanlings,  no effect of 
Ralgro  on liveweight  gain was obtained.
Feed intake
Experiments  have been carried  out in Grange  to determine  whether  
implanted  steers have a parallel  increase  in feed intake in relation  to 
increased  level of weight  gain. Either  Ralgro  or Ralgro  + Finaplix  in­
creased  feed intake by 2-4%. Thus, growth  promoters  work mainly  by 
increasing  conversion  of feed into meat.
31
Carcass  composition
The results of commercial  vacuum  pack cutting  for estimating  the 
weights  of lean meat, fat trim and bone are shown in Table 9. The 
increase  in carcass  weight  following  Ralgro  and Finaplix  is mainly  lean 
meat, a result similar  to that in bulls. In contrast,  there is the normal  
increase  in fat and lean in the carcass  following  Romensin,  a situation  
comparable  to that in steers  given more energy.
Possible  combinations  to use
In steers  the following  combinations  can be used ;
1. Female  + male growth  promoters:  the two are additive  for example,  
Ralgro  + Finaplix,  Synovex  + Finaplix.
2. A growth  promoter  + feed additive : the two are additive  for example,  
Ralgro  + Romensin,  Synovex  + Romensin.
3. Fernale  + male growth  promoter  + feed additive : the three are not 
additive  to date, for example,  Ralgro  + Finaplix  + Romensin.
In female  cattle Relgro  + Finaplix  are not additive;  use either Fina ­
plix or Romensin.
Factors  affecting  response  to growth  promoters
Response  is affected  by plane of nutrition  and animals  should be 
gaining  at least 0.5 kg per day in order to get a good response  from 
growth  promoters.  Where  animals  gained  less than 6.25 kg. per day, the 
response  was very poor. Therefore,  growth  promoters  can be used on 
finishing  cattle fed on good quality  silage  and concentrates  or in animals  
turned  out to grass from April to July. MFC  results  from the U.K. indi­
cate that the best growth  responses  were obtained  in animals  which  were 
implanted  at turnout  to grass in spring. Response  is also affected  by sex; 
it is clear from the data that steers show larger  responses  than heifers  or 
cull cows. It is also clear that in order to achieve  maximum  response  
cattle must be free of endo and ectoparasites.
Residues  of growth  promoters
Many  of the anabolic  compounds  used in animal  production  have the 
effect of altering  the levels  of the natural  growth  hormones  in the animal.  
Natural  hormones  are safe to use provided  that levels in blood  and tissue 
do not exceed  the normal  levels found under a variety  of physiological 
situations.
Synovex-S  implants  increased  the levels of oestradiol  17 beta in 
plasma  after implantation.  Levels  were still raised  60 days after implan ­
tation but by 120 days the levels were similar  to that in non-implanted  
steers. Finaplix  residues  of trenbolone  acetate  have been found in vari­
ous tissues  63 days after implantation  in amounts  similar  or lower than 
normal  levels of testosterone  in bulls. Ralgro  is absorbed  slowly at a 
fairly*  constant  rate from the implants.  Using  tritium  labelled  resorcylic 
acid safe amounts  of residues  were found  in muscle,  liver, kidney  and fat 
65 days after implantation.
32
Limitations
1. Animals  must not be slaughtered  for 60-65 days after implantation  in 
order  to ensure  that residues  are low or undetectable  in meat.
2. Breeding  males or females  must not be treated  with hormonal  type 
growth  promoters.
3. Insert implants  in the ear only as there is a residual  amount  of com­
pound  at the site of implantation  for many months.  Since the ear is 
disposed  of, this does not create  any hazard.
4. There  is variation  from farm to farm in response  obtained.
5. Fluctuations  in beef prices  should  be borne  in mind when deciding  to 
use implants.  If beef prices  suddenly  decline  treated  cattle  should  not 
be sold until the recommended  withdrawal  period  has elapsed.
The Ralgro  + Finaplik  combination  is effective  for about 120-130  
days. Thereafter,  the animals  will gain weight  at the normal  rate. The 
only limitation  on date of slaughter  is to ensure  that the recommended  
withdrawal  period  has elapsed.
Conclusions
Growth  promoters  produce  an economic  response  in steers but they 
must be used properly.  In finishing  beef cattle the use of growth  pro­
moters  is one effective  way to improve  profitability.  Thus, every effort  
must be made to ensure  that this aid remains  available  to beef producers  
by proper  use of the compounds.

Recent  Developments  in 
Dairy  Cow Nutrition
P. A. GLEESON
The Agricultural  Institute,  Moorepark,  Fernioy,  Co. Cork.
The major ingredients  of the dairy cow ’s diet are grass (60%),  silage  
(30%)  and concentrates  (10%).  The importance  of silage  quality,  quantity  
and good preservation  was discussed  by the author  in this Journal  in 
1978, Volume  13, page 65. This paper describes  in more detail the use 
of concentrates  in the diet of the dairy cow. In addition  the age and 
weight  at first calving  of heifers  are discussed.
Energy  content  of the diet
Presently  many feeds for ruminants  are expressed  as Mega Joules  
(M.J.)  of Metabolisable  Energy  (M.E.)  per kilogram  of dry matter. From  
these values  the energy  content  of the diet can be determined.  Most pub­
lications  only contain  a mean value of the individual  feed ingredients.  
However,  great variations  can occur.
The energy  value of the formulated  diet is influenced  by the oil con­
tent, fibre level, ash and dry matter  content  of the ration. High fibre 
values  will reduce  the feeding  value as will high levels  of ash and mois ­
ture in the diet. Increasing  the oil level will tend to increase  the energy 
value of the ration. Fats or oils contain  a high gross energy level 
(approximately  39 M.J./kg)  as compared  with protein  or carbohydrate  
(approximately  17.1 M.J./kg)  and the feeding  of fat or oil is a potential  
method  of increasing  energy  intake. High energy  diets are essential  for 
high yielding  cows in early lactation  due to their low intake  capacity  at 
this time. Fat or oils can be fed in either  protected  or unprotected  form. 
The purpose  of protecting  the fat is to reduce  the breakdown  of fat in the 
rumen. The protection  is achieved  by encapsulating  the fat droplet  in a 
layer  of aldehyde  treated  protein.  The research  findings  on feeding  unnro-  
tected fat are variable.  In general  data suggest  that with roughage  diets  
the effect of high inclusion  of fat in the diet does not give increased  
output  of milk.
The effect  of tallow  added  to a concentrate  diet was studied  at Moore ­
park. A preparation  containing  tallow  and protein  (75 :25) was prepared  
as a fine mix and a ration  formulated  to contain  9% oil in the concen ­
trate was compared  with a control  ration  containing  3.75%  oil.
Thirty  spring  calving  cows were fed al libitum  silage plus 7.25 kg of 
a 16% protein  ration for a three week preliminary  period  after calving 
and were then assigned  to either  of three treatments  for an eight week  
experimental  period  as follows :
(1) Ad libitum  silage plus 7.25 kg of dairy ration ( 18% CP) normal  
energy.
35
(2) Ad libitum  silage plus 7.25 kg of dairy ration  (18% CP) including 
added  fat (high energy).
(3) Ad libitum  silage plus 6.6 kg of dairy ration (18% CP) including 
added fat but energy  intake of the concentrate  is equalised  to the 
level of treatment  1. The composition  of the dairy rations  are shown 
in Table 1 and the chemical  composition  in Table  2.

Energy  concentration  (M.J./kg  DM) 12.8 13.8
Both rations  were of good quality,  low in fibre and ash and high in dry 
matter  concentration.  The energy  density  of both rations  was high 11 5 
M.J./kg  as fed for the control  and 12.5 M.J./kg  for the high energy  
ration.
The results  are presented  in Table 3. Group  A, receiving  7.25 kg of 
the control  ration,  had a similar  performance  to Group  C, receiving  6.60 
kg of the high energy  ration,  in milk yield,  fat yield,  protein  yield,  fat %, 
protein  % and liveweight  changes.  Group  B receiving  7.25 kg of the high 
energy  ration produced  significantly  more milk than Group  C and also 
more fat and protein.  There  was no significant  difference  between  A and
36
B in any of the parameters  measured.  A digestibility  trial was carried  
out in conjunction  with the experiment  but there were no differences  in 
the digestibility  of the dry matter,  energy  or fibre on any of the 3 diets.

The results  of this trial would not justify  the inclusion  of tallow  at 
high levels in dairy rations  to increase  energy  density.  It must be noted  
that the control  ration  was of high quality  and possibly  greater  dilTerences  
might  occur if this were not so. The results  emphasize  that it is possible  
to formulate  high quality  rations  with normal  ingredients,  available  to 
the compounding  industry  without  resorting  to the inclusion  of high fat 
levels in the diet which may cause digestive  upsets  and reduced  digesti ­
bility of the diet. The form of the added  fat or oil may also be important  
but the best responses  obtained  from the addition  of high levels  of fat or 
oil in the diet is when they are protected  by the addition  of aldehyde  
treated  protein  to encapsulate  the fat droplets.
The protein  content  of dairy rations
The two major components  in concentrate  rations  are energy and 
protein,  but minerals  and vitamins  are also included.  There  is little criti­
cal information  available  on nutritive  value of silage protein  and on 
protein  supplementation  of grass silage. In many silages,  50% of the 
crude protein  is composed  of non-protein  nitrogen.  Under  such circum ­
stances,  although  the crude  protein  intake  of the cow maybe  theoretically  
adequate,  there maybe  a response  to additional  protein.  In two feeding 
trials at Moorepark  involving  180 individually  fed cows, the effect of 
varying  the protein  content  of the concentrate  was examined  with average  
and poor quality  silage  as the basal feeds. Concentrates  were formulated  
to contain  three levels of protein  (12, 15 and 18%) and were fed at 3.0,
5.5 and 8.0 kg per day to nine groups  of cows with each silage. The 
concentrates  were composed  of barley  and soyabean,  and contained  2% 
mineral  vitamin  mixture.  The experimental  feeding  period  in early lac­
tation was eight weeks,  and cows then uniformally  treated  on pasture  
for 12 weeks. In Table  4 the milk yields  for the eight week experimental  
period  and for the period 1-20 weeks are presented  and in addition  the
37
margins  over concentrate  costs are also shown. The price of the con­
centrates  was adjusted  in relation  to the crude protein  concentrations  in 
the diet. The results  indicate  that there is little response  to protein  at the 
low level of feeding.  However,  when the feeding  levels increased  to the
5.5 and 8 kg per day there was a response  in all cases from 12 to 15% 
crude protein  and only at the higher  feeding  levels was there a response 
from going  from 15 to 18% crude  protein.  The results  presented  in Table  
4 are data from one of the silages  fed in this experiment.  When  the results  
of both experiments  are examined  it is concluded  that a feeding  level of 
7 kg a day at 16% crude protein  is the most economic  at the present  
feed price-milk  ratio. However,  if feeding  levels exceed 8 kg a day 
it maybe  beneficial  to Increase  the level of protein  to 18%. The data 
further  suggest,  particularly  in the eight week experimental  period,  an 
inter-changeability  between  energy  and protein.  This is illustrated  when 
the feeding  level of 5.5 kg per day at 18% crude  protein  is compared  with 
the 8 kg feeding  level at 12% protein  where  similar  milk production  was 
obtained  for both groups. This result occured  in both experiments.  The 
protein  content  of a concentrate  had no effect on silage intake. As the 
level of concentrate  feeding  increased  the intake  of silage  was significantly 
decreased.  Liveweight  changes  during  the eight week experimental  period 
reflected  the level of feeding  with greater  body weight  loss occuring  at 
the lower  feeding  levels. Milk fat and milk protein  percentages  were not 
affected  by the level of protein  in the concentrate.  As would  be expected,  
milk protein  percentage  increased  with the level of concentrate  feeding.

Flat versus  variable  feeding
levels  of concentrates  to spring  calving  dairy cows
There  is much  discussion  at the present  time on the methods  of feed­
ing concentrates  to dairy cows. This mainly  arises from the higher  milk
38
yields presently  been obtained  on many dairy farms. Many people  con­
clude  that with higher  yields  it is necessary  to allocate  the concentrates  in 
relation  to yield. This has resulted  in the installation  of feeders  into many  
milking  parlours  to allow allocation  of concentrates  in relation  to yield.  
The inclusion  of feeders  in parlours  may be for the purpose  of overcom ­
ing the problems  of handling  large quantities  of concentrates  for dairy  
herds. An experiment  has been carried  out at Moorepark  comparing  the 
feeding  of fixed levels of concentrates  to lactating  cows with varying 
concentrate  feeding  levels in relation  to yields. One group of cows was 
fed 7.3 kg of concentrates  per cow per day for an eight week period  while 
a second group was fed the same total quantity  of concentrates  but 
allocated  to each cow in proportion  to her yield. The milk yields of the 
cows in each group  varied  between  3^ to 6 gallons  at the initiation  of the 
experiment.  The results  of the experiment  are presented  in Table 5.
Table 5

Milk protein % 3.10 3.08
Silage dry matter  intake as percent  of 
bodyweight 1.61 1.40
Liveweight  change  (kg/day) 0.06 -0.32
The results indicate  that there was no significant  difference  in milk 
yields or milk composition  for either treatment.  It can be concluded  
from this experiment  that provided  there is no undue competition  for 
concentrates  at the feeding  trough  there is no nutritional  justification  for 
including  expensive  methods  of feeding  in dairy farming.  Close  examina ­
tion of the data show that those cows on the variable  feeding  rate receiv ­
ing the higher  levels of feed reduced  their silage intake as the level of 
concentrates  increased,  and similarly  those on the lower feeding  levels  
tended  to eat more silage.
Age and weight  at first calving
Due to the seasonal  calving  nature  of the Irish Dairy  Industry  heifers 
entering  the dairy herd calve at two or three years of age. The effect of 
both age and weight  at first calving  is being studied  at the Agricultural  
Institute  Field Station,  Ballyragget,  Co. Kilkenny.  Friesian  spring  calving  
heifers  have been divided  into four treatment  groups  to compare  the effect  
of weight  at first calving  on lactation  performance.  Two groups  had a
39
target weight  of 450 kg weight  before  calving  and were stocked  at 0.95 
and 0.75 acres per animal  after calving.  The other  two groups  were also 
stocked  at 0.95 or 0.75 and had a target  weight  of 525 kg before  calving.  
These  stocking  rates provide  grazing  and silage  requirements.  Three  year 
old calving  heifers  were also stocked  at either  0.95 and 0.75 animals  per 
acre and had a pre-calving  weight  of 565 kg. The two year old calvers 
completed  three lactations  by the end of 1978 and the three year olds 
have completed  two lactations.  For ease of presentation  the stocking  rate 
groups  are combined  and the results  are summarised  in Table  6.

In the first lactation  the two year olds weighing  525 kg produced  sub­
stantially  more milk than two year olds calving  at 450 kg. During  the 
summer  and autumn  of 1976 feed supplies  were scarce  and these animals  
had little opportunity  to gain weight  between  the first and second  lacta ­
tions, and their pre-calving  weight  in 1977 differed  very little from their  
pre-calving  weight  in 1976. This resulted  in a disappointing  milk perfor ­
mance  during 1977. However  during  that period  the animals  increased  
substantially  in body-weight  as indicated  by their pre-calving  weight  at 
the start of 1978. The milk production  performance  in 1978 increased  
substantially  over the 1977 figures. To date the heavier  two year old 
calvers  have over a 100 gallons  more milk produced  at the end of the 
third lactation.  Delaying  calving  to three years of age did not greatly  
improve  the milk lactation  performance  in the first lactation.  Modest  
milk increases  between  first and second  lactation  were recorded  for these  
three year old calving  heifers  even though  they did increase  in weight 
between  first and second  lactations.  The two and three year old calvers 
were born in the same year but the milk production  at the end of 1978 
shows  that the three year old calvers  have 600 gallons  less milk produced  
than the two year calvers  to date. The early indications  are that two year 
olds at the heavier  weights  (525 kg) have a lower  culling  rate than either
40
of the other two groups. While this experiment  is still in progress  one 
could  indicate  that the pre-calving  target  weight  for heifers  should  be over 
500 kg calving  at two years and there is little advantage  to be gained  in 
delaying  calving  to three years of age if the heifers  are welt grown  as two 
year olds.
The effect  of level of concentrate  feeding  to dairy cows  
on a whole  farm system  basis
An experiment  to study the effect of pre- and post-calving  feeding 
levels  of concentrates  to dairy cows on a whole  farm system  basis is pre­
sently in progress  at the Agricultural  Institute  Field Station,  Solohead,  
Co. Tipperary.  There are four treatment  groups : herds A and B are 
stocked  at 1.17 acres per cow and herds  C and D at 0.96 acres per cow. 
Herds  A and C are fed 2.7 kg of concentrates  daily to all heifers  and first 
lactation  animals  in the prepartum  feeding  period. Post-calving  feeding  
levels for these groups  amount  to 5.5 kg of concentrates  daily to all ani­
mals from calving  until March  31st; and 2.7 kg thereafter  until the middle  
of May. All cows in herds B and D are fed 2.7 kg of concentrates  per 
day in the pre-calving  period  which  commences  in late November.  These  
two groups  of cows are fed 9 kg of concentrates  post-calving  until March  
31st and are then reduced  to 4.5 kg daily until the middle  of May. The 
first years results  (1978)  are presented  in Table  7.

The low meal groups  A and C were fed less than 500 kg of the con­
centrates  per cow and the high meal feeding  groups  B and D had an 
intake  of 860 kg and 750 kg of concentrates  respectively.  There  was no 
response  to increased  concentrate  feeding  levels at the low stocking  rate 
and there was an advantage  of 43 gallons  at the higher  stocking  rates.  
When one studies  the margin  over concentrates  there was no economic  
advantage  to feeding  the higher  levels  of feeding  at either  the low or high 
stocking  rates. This is the first year of this experiment  and therefore  the 
results  must be treated  with caution  but they do indicate  that care must  
be taken that excessive  amounts  of concentrates  are not fed to spring  
calving  cows resulting  in reduced  profitability  on the farm.
41
A similar  type of experiment  is in progress  at Moorepark  where  the 
concentrate  feeding  levels post-calving  over the entire  grazing  season  are 
being studied. The experiment  involves  four experimental  groups;  
Groups  A and B are stocked  at 1 cow per acre for the entire season 
and C and D are stocked  at 0.8 acres per cow. Groups  A and C are 
fed the lower levels of concentrates  approximately  500 kg per cow 
and Group  D and B are fed higher  concentrate  feeding  levels amount ­
ing to approximately  one tonne over the total lactations.  Groups  A 
and C are fed 7.3 kg of concentrates  per day post-calving  until the 
middle  of April when meal feeding  ceases with the exception  of 0.5 
kg of concentrates  to carry calcined  magnesite  until the end of May. 
No concentrates  were fed in the pre-calving  period,  with the excep ­
tion of the in-calf heifers. Groups B and D were fed 7.3 kg of 
concentrates  from calving  until the mid May when concentrate  feeding 
ceased. From early July until mid August  supplementary  feeding  at the 
rate of 3.2 kg a day was introduced  to groups  B and D as milk yields  
were declining  at over 2\% per week at this period.  Concentrates  were 
introduced  to both B and D in early September  at the rate of 3.2 kg of 
concentrates  per day until drying  off in mid-November.  This experiment  
then allows  a comparison  of more normal  management  groups,  A and C 
with groups  B and D where  higher  inputs  of concentrates  are fed to over­
come possible  feed deficits  during  the mid summer  period  and at the end 
of the grazing  season  where  herbage  availability  is declining.  The results  
for 1978 are presented  in Table  8,

The feeding  of an additional  500 kg of concentrates  resulted  in in­
creased  milk output  of over 100 gallons  for both stocking  rates, resulting  
in a response  of 1 kg of extra milk/kg  of concentrates  fed for both stock ­
ing rates. At present  concentrate  prices (£130) ton) this would not be 
economical.  However  if cheaper  feed ingredients  were available  there  
maybe some economic  justification  of higher levels. In Table 9 the 
responses  to the additional  meals over the different  periods  in the lacta ­
tion are shown. They indicate  clearly  that the continuation  of concen ­
trates from mid April to mid May gave a very poor response  in milk
42
yield. Better  responses  were obtained  to mid lactation  and late lactation  
feeding. But again the feeding  levels are not economically  justified  at 
concentrates  costing  between  £125 and £130 a ton.

This experiment  is also in its first year and it is not possible  to make  
definite  conclusions  on the feeding  of the additional  concentrates  particu ­
larly during  the mid and late lactation  periods. Half of the animals  in 
this experiment  were in their first lactation.
Cull cows
Data from a cull cow nutrition  experiment  at Moorepark  were used 
to demonstrate  the effect of level of nutrition  and body condition  on ani­
mal performance.  The object was to provide  information  on liveweight  
gains attainable  by cull cows and to determine  the economics  of over­
wintering  them. It was possible  during  the trial to examine  the effect of 
condition  and to relate  condition  changes  to liveweight.
Thirty-five  non-pregnant  cull cows from spring-calving  herds were 
assembled  and divided  on the basis of body condition  into high and low
43
score groups. These groups  were fed moderate  quality  silage and con­
centrates  as follows :
High score —ad libitum  silage.
High score —ad libitum  silage + 4 kg concentrates  daily.
Low score —ad libitum  silage.
Low score —ad libitum  silage + 4 kg concentrates  daily.
The trial lasted  92 days (7/11/77  to 9/2/78).  The concentrates  used con­
tained 16% crude protein;  silage intakes  were measured.  At the end of 
the trial the animals  were slaughtered  and six carcasses  from each group  
were divided  into muscle,  fat and bone components.  Performance  and 
carcass  disection  data are given in Tables  10 and 11, respectively.

All groups  increased  liveweight  during  the trial. Low score animals  
had a slightly  higher  rate of gain and consumed  an extra 0.4 tons of silage  
per animal.  There  was a good liveweight  response  to concentrate  feeding 
and rate of gain for these  cows was double  that of the silage  only groups. 
They consumed  less silage,  substituting  concentrates  for silage  at the rate 
of 1 kg concentrate  dry matter  for 0.4 kg silage dry matter. All groups  
improved  condition  and attained  good scores within the 92 days.
The low score groups  had lower killing-out  percentages;  they had 
lighter  carcasses  and csonsequently  a lower total yield of lean meat, fat 
and bone (Table  11).
Carcasses  from high score cows yielded  more lean meat but also gave 
much greater  yields of fat. This was especially  true for the concentrate  
fed group.

Modern  Milking
J. O’SHEA
Agricultural  Institute.  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
This review of modern  milking  requires  some definition  of the term  
“modern ”. A survey  of milking  practices  and equipment  in Ireland  was 
carried  out in 1960 and the results  of that survey  provided  the impetus  
for subsequent  milking  research. For the first time, research  reports  
named the makes of equipment.  Previously,  components  which were 
tested  in Research  Institutes  were identified  only by code numbers.
Table 1 shows the percentage  of the herds of different  sizes which 
were milked  in different  types of sheds  and the milking  rates of the herds. 
The outstanding  feature  of the data was the low number  of cows milked  
per man per hour.

Table 2 shows that a large percentage  of herds which had milking 
machines  were hand-milked  for part of the year. Ten per cent of the 
farmers  in the survey  had reverted  to hand-milking  from machine  milk ­
ing. Their  reasons  for this decision  are given in Table  3.

Present  situation
In 1979 it is not unusual  to find milkers  milking  70 cows per man per 
hour with a low incidence  of mechanical  faults, low levels of mastitis  
and producing  milk of high bacterialogical  quality. What has happened  
in the meantime  to cause  these changes?
After the 1960 survey studies  were commenced  on seven aspects  of 
milking  and milking  equipment;  the activities  were highly inter-related  
and are separated  only for convenience.  Similar  activities  have also been 
initiated  in some other Institutes  and milking  machine  manufacturers  
have also played a major role in the developments.  The inter-related  
studies  sought  to improve :
(1) Mechanical  efficiency  of milking  equipment.
(2) The adverse  effect of milking  machine  on infection.
(3) The standard  of installation  on farms.
(4) Maintenance  standards  of farms.
(5) Cleaning  of equipment  on farms.
(6) Milking  shed design.
(7) Number  of cows milked  per man per hour.
Performance  tests
To ensure  durable  and properly  functioning  milking  equipment,  milk ­
ing machines  and components  were tested under controlled  conditions  
and reports  were issued on their performaice.  This resulted  in a major  
improvement  in the quality  of components  on the market  (Table  4).
The improvement  in performance  indicated  by Table  4 underestimates  
the actual improvement  because  the standards  were being  raised  as years 
progressed.  Manufacturers  have generally  replaced  faulty components  
by satisfactory  components  from other manufacturers  until they had 
sufficiently  improved  their own components.  By way of comparison,  the

Machine  milking  and mastitis
Several experiments  in Moorepark  show the relationship between
irregular  vacuum fluctuations  and increased new infections  (Table 6).

Larger vacuum  pumps and pipes are now being installed  to improve  
vacuum  stability  and in response  to higher  reserves  vacuum  regulators  
have higher  capacities  and greater  sensitivity.
More recent  results  have shown  a relationship  between  liner slip and 
high new infection  rates (Table  7).

Manufacturers  are now trying  to improve  the stability  of the liners on 
cows ’ teats to reduce  the risk of infection  and to minimize  the disruption  
to milk incurred  by slips and fall offs.
Standard  of installation
Milking  machines  will be properly  installed  if farmers  request  that 
machines  are installed  to the Irish standard  IS 187 and get a written  
agreement  from the installer  that the machine  will be so installed.
Maintenance
Installers  generally  provide  a routine  maintenance  chart. Farmers  
should  follow  these instructions.  Technicians  have been trained  at Moore ­
park and more recently  in the Regional  Technical  Colleges  for testing  of 
milking  machines.  Every machine  should  be tested at least once a year 
by such a trained  technician  and his recommendations  should be fol­
lowed. There is evidence  that faults develop  on milking  machines  on 
many  farms  due to bad maintenance  (Table  8).

Cleaning  of milking  machines
Cleaning  problems  are minimal  in properly  installed  machines.  Simple 
cheap methods  of cleaning  have been developed  and have proven  very 
satisfactory.  Ease of cleaning  is monitored  during  performance  tests on 
components.
Milking  shed design
A booklet  on milking  shed design  is available  from The Agricultural  
Institute.  Milking  sheds should  have pipelines  rather  than recorder  jars. 
Herring  bone sheds should have two stalls per unit; sheds should  not 
generally  have feeders  or automatic  cluster  removers.  To record  yields 
milk meters can be used at 3 - 5 week intervals  for recording  yields.  
Double-up  parlours  (1 stall per unit) are only 60% as efficient  (cows  
milked  per unit per hour)  as two stall per unit plants.
Automatic  cluster  removers  were originally  designed  to prevent  in­
creased  mastitis  due to over-milking.  However,  there was no evidence 
available  to suggest  that over-milking  increased  mastitis.  The effect of 
cluster  removers  on herd milking  rates in a New Zealand  survey  was 
variable.  There  was an increase  in output  of up to 25% in milking  rate 
where  milkers  had corrected  wrong  routines  (spending  a lot of time trying  
to avoid over-milking).  At the other  end of the scale there was a depres ­
sion of up to 8% in output  due to using automatic  cluster  removers.
Throughput  of cows
The number  of cows milked  per man per hour will largely  be deter ­
mined by the number  of units handled  and this in turn will be deter ­
mined by the milking  shed design and properly  functioning  milking  
equipment  which  needs  no alterations  during  milking.  Machine  stripping  
can be omitted  with clusters  which have low strip yields and this will 
allow more units to be used.
Ancillary  equipment
As the duration  of machine  milking  is reduced,  the ancillary  activities  
such as yard-washing,  cleaning  of the milking  machine,  etc., are becoming 
a greater  percentage  of total time spent in the milking  shed. Conse ­
quently,  increased  attention  is being given at Moorepark  to ancillary  
equipment  such as different  types of in-parlour  feeding  automatic  cluster  
removers,  automatic  recorder  jar emptying,  yard-washing  and stand-by  
generators.
Electronics
In the past few years there has been a continuing  proliferation  of elec­
tronic equipment  for performing  various  functions  in milking  machines.  
Whilst  some of the future  improvements  in milking  equipment  will be by 
means  of electronic  devices,  not many advantages  have yet been proved.  
Manufacturers  should be required  to conduct  adequate  testing  of new 
equipment  or ideas before  they are sold to the consumer.  Farmers  should
53
be aware  of those features  which  are fashions  and those which  are neces ­
sities.
Summary
1. Performance  testing  ensures  that milking  equipment  available  to Irish 
farmers  is as good as is available  anywhere  in the world.
Machines  will be properly  installed  if specified  to IS 187.
Maintenance  on farms and a yearly  test by a technician  is essential. 
Milking  shed design  should  be simple  and proliferation  of equipment  
which  serves  no useful  purpose  should  be avoided.
Up to 70 cows per man per hour can be milked  in simple  milking 
sheds with good simple  milking  equipment.

This paper examines  a few possible  constraints  and questions  that arise 
from continued  growth  in milk output  in Ireland.  As the economic  condi ­
tions under  which  further growth  in output  might  take place  will be deter ­
mined mainly  by decisions  in Brussels,  a few comments  on the E.E.C.  
Commissions  proposals  are appropriate.
E.E.C.  Commission  Proposals
principle,  namely, that any measures  applied should be common  
measures  applying  throughout  the Community  so that Irish producers  are 
maintained  in a similar  competitive  position  with producers  elsewhere  in 
the Community.  This is the central  principle  of the Common  Agricul ­
tural Policy. The underlying  theory  is that under a system  of common  
measures  production  will tend to locate  itself in the regions  best suited  to 
it. The favourable  consequences  of this principle  for Irish milk produc ­
tion over the past six years are clear from Fig. 1. The relative  growth  
rates in milk supply  of the different  countries  strongly  suggest  that even
if Community  production  is no longer  to expand  into the future,  Irish  
production  can still expand  considerably,  so long as the principle  of 
common  measures  applying  throughout  the Community  is preserved.  But 
the introduction  of special  measures  to be applied  on a regional  or a sup­
plier basis, resulting  in regions  or suppliers  with a higher  output  growth  
paying  higher  penalties,  would be contrary  to the Common  Agricultural  
Policy,  and would  mean that a common  policy  for milk would  no longer  
exist.
Future  milk output  in Ireland
If milk output  continues  to increase,  will further  supplies  come from  
increased  yields or greater  cow numbers?  Study of past performance  
(Fig. 2) shows  that :
(i) In the decade  before  E.E.C.  membership  1963-1973,  creamery  milk 
output  increased  by nearly  67%; two thirds  of this increase  was due 
to increased  cow numbers  and one third was due to increased  yield.
(ii) Since E.E.C. membership  in 1973 creamery  output increased  by 
42%. However,  almost  two thirds of this increase  was due to in­
creased  yield,  with only one third due to greater  cow numbers  (Table
1). Yields  at present  are estimated  at 650 gals, per cow on average  
and have increased  by about 140 gals, on average  since E.E.C.  mem ­
bership  in 1973.

Milk yield
Let us consider  the factors which contributed  to increased  yields.  
Meal feeding  levels increased  from 4| cwts. per cow in 1973/74  to about  
9J cwts. per cow in 1978 and milk yields  increased  by 140 gals, per cow 
in this period  (Table  2). How much have meals  contributed  to increased  
yields? It depends  on making  an assumption  on the response  from in­
creased  meal feeding. Assuming  7 lbs. meals/gal.,  it is estimated  that 
about 78 gals, was produced  from extra meals. On this basis about  half 
of the 140 gal. increase  was therefore  due to other factors,  i.e., improved  
husbandry  and breeding,  better grassland  management,  more selective 
culling,  earlier  calving,  etc. The increase  in meal feeding  has been associ ­
ated with a more favourable  milk to meals  price ratio (Table  2).

In the future  it is unlikely  that the milk/meal  price ratio will become 
more favourable.  Hence,  further  yield increases  will depend  more on the 
other aspects  of dairy husbandry  as listed above.

In discussing  growth  in cow numbers  it is more relevant  to consider  
total cows rather than the creamery  herd only. One of the surprising  
aspects  of E.E.C.  membership  to date is that total cow numbers  have 
remained  static. While creamery  cow numbers  have grown,  this growth  
has merely  replaced  the fall in beef cow numbers,  and from the latest  
figures  close to zero growth  will be true for 1979 also. In contrast,  there  
was a steady  growth  of about 3% per annum  in total cow numbers  in 
the decade  prior to E.E.C.  membership  (Fig. 3).
In explaining  the lack of growth  in total cow numbers  since 1973, the 
cattle crisis in 1973/74  is of foremost  consideration.  However,  there are 
other  factors  which  merit  discussion ;
1. the culling  rate, as a percentage  of the total cow herd;
2. the replacement  rate, as a percentage  of the total cow herd.
By definition  if the inflow  of heifers  or the replacement  rate is greater  
than the culling  rate, the herd increases  in sizes.
In general,  up to 1973 the culling  rate averaged  17% and the replace-  
rate was 20%. Hence,  growth  in the total cow herd was 3% per annum.  
The culling  rate fluctuates  much more widely  as can be seen from Fig. 4, 
between  the extremes  of 12-25%,  compared  with a very steady  replace ­
ment rate. The periods  of rapid  growth,  1963 - 1965 and 1970 - 1973 were 
associated  mainly  with a large drop in the culling  rate.

Since 1973 the culling  rate has moved  on average  to about 20%. the 
replacement  rate has remained  at 20% with the result  that there has been 
no growth  at all in the total herd. The points  arising  with regard  to future  
herd growth  are :
1. Has the culling  rate now moved  permanently  to a higher  level of 20% 
and will it possibly  move even higher  over the next few years due to 
the disease  eradication  programme?
2. If (1) is accepted  then there can be no herd growth  until the replace ­
ment rate moves  towards  25% of the herd, i.e. proportionately  more 
heifers  would  need to be directed  for breeding,  and fewer for beef.
Heifers  for breeding  or beef
The breakdown  of the utilisation  of heifers  as between  breeding  and 
beef in recent years provides  some interesting  insights.  From approxi ­
mately  2 million  cows over 800,000  maiden  heifers  are utilised  each year 
either  for breeding  or for beef production.  A breakdown  of heifer  utilisa ­
tion for the past five years shows very consistently  that about 45% of 
maiden  heifers  were utilised  for breeding  and about 55% for beef (Table  
3). The 45% for breeding  corresponds  to the 20% replacement  rate in 
the cow herd outlined  earlier. Now if the replacement  rate is to move  
towards  25% of the cow herd to provide  cow herd growth  in the future,  
then the breakdown  in the utilisation  of maiden  heifers  must be reversed.

For beef as % of total 54.2 56.8 54.2 54.1 53.6
' Perliminary  estimate
In Other  words.  55 -60%  of maiden  heifers  must be allocated  to breeding, 
leaving  40-45%  for beef production.  This change  in the utilisation  of 
heifers would firstly have important  implications  for breeding  policy.  
Secondly,  from an economic  view point,  schemes  for retaining  heifers  for 
breeding  instead  of selling  heifers  as beef animals  may be required,  par­
ticularly  in the case of the beef cow herd.
Increased  milk output —implications  for 
processing  sector
If creamery  milk supplies  continue  to increase,  what are the implica ­
tions for the processing  sector? The need for extra capacity  depends  
firstly on the seasonality  of milk supplies.  This subject  has been dis­
cussed  in detail at previous  conferences  (1). Hence,  only a summary  of 
the conclusions  is given here.

Irish manufacturing  milk supplies  are highly  seasonal,  unlike  the re­
mainder  of the E.E.C.  (Fig. 5). In butter  manufacture,  if production  in 
the peak month  is taken to be at 100% factory  capacity,  then overall 
capacity  utilisation  in the year in Ireland  is slightly  over 50%. In contrast  
o this, all other E.E.C.  countries  have a corresponding  capacity  utilisa ­
tion of the order  of 70 - 80% (Table  4).

u pattern  it to move in the long-term  towards  that of say
Holland  (Fig. 5) it would mean that present  processing  capacity  could 
hand e l,200 million  gallons  compared  with 853 million  gallons  actually  
handled  m 1978. This would represent  a major saving in investment  
costs at processing  level. Further  savings  at processing  level with a more 
even supply  pattern  would arise in labour  costs, fuel and power costs 
milk assembly  and in product  storage  and stock finance.
On the other hand, a Dutch  type milk supply  pattern  would involve  
a substantial  amount  of autumn  calving  and much  higher  milk production  
costs. Estimates  of the increased  milk production  costs are based here 
on a three year experiment  carried out by An Foras Taluntais  at 
allyraggett  a few years ago (2) in which specialised  autumn  calving 
and spring calving  herds were maintained,  i.e. present  day costs are

applied to the physical  performance  levels in the experiment.  From  
this work it is concluded  that autumn  calvers  would require  at present  
about lOp/gal.  extra over the whole  of the lactation  to compensate  for 
their increased  costs, mainly  due to the increased  meal feeding.  A Dutch  
type milk supply  pattern  would involve  about 45% autumn  calving  and 
55% spring  calving,  as derived  from the shape  of lactation  curves. Hence  
the 45% autumn  calving  at a production  cost increase  of about lOp/gal.  
is equivalent  to a 4.5p/gal.  milk production  cost increase  when spread  
over the total milk supply.
The total savings  at processing  level from a Dutch  type milk supply  
pattern  have been estimated  at about  2ip/gal.,  which  is very considerable  
in processing  cost terms,  but is only about  half of the increased  milk pro­
duction  cost. Hence,  it was concluded  that movement  to autumn  calving 
for a proportion  of the creamery  herd, to give a milk supply pattern  
similar  to Holland,  would not be advantageous  in overall  terms for the 
Irish creamery  industry.
This is not to suggest  that our calving  dates should  remain  static. The 
mean calving  date for the creamery  herd at present  is centred  on March,  
but has been moving  forward  steadily  over the past couple of years. 
Examination  of lactation  curves  for January  and April calvers,  based  on 
a sample  of 1,200 cows in Moorepark  herds,  shows  that lactation  for a 
January  calver  is 10 months  in duration  and is evenly  spread  through  the 
year, whereas  the lactation  for an April  calver  is about  8 months  in dura ­
tion and reaches  a peak in May/June,  the period  of the creameries  over­
all peak supply  (Fig. 6). Hence  movement  towards  earlier  calving  should 
result  in some improvement  in capacity  utilisation  at the processing  level.
All the above discussion  on seasonality  has been related  to storable  
products.  Some level of autumn  calving  would be desirable  in the 
development  of short life products,  which firstly require  more milk in 
winter  than is currently  available  and secondly,  give sufficient  returns  to 
economically  support  a level of autumn  calving  on farms.
Efficiency
The prospect  of limited price increases  in the immediate  future  
places more emphasis  on improvements  in efficiency  at all levels of the 
industry  as a means  of increasing  returns.
One important  area where efficiency  can still be improved  is milk 
assembly.  It is many years since bulk collection  was first discussed,  and 
now over 50% of milk in the country  is collected  in bulk. However,  the 
branch  creamery  system has remained  in many areas and is operating  
side by side with bulk collection.  The consequences  are ;
1. For bulk collection,  while many suppliers  still deliver to branch  
creameries,  bulk tankers  must travel long distances  to collect  a full 
tanker  load thus increasing  bulk collection  costs.
2. The remaining  branch  creamery  system  is even more costly  than the 
original,  as the throughput  at a branch  falls when some of the big 
suppliers  change to bulk collection,  thus raising branch creamery  
operating  costs.
63
FIGURE  6

Studies  of branch  creamery  operating  costs in a number  of co-ops  in 
recent  years show that for branches  with greater  than 500,000  gals, per 
annum,  a 2p/gal.  cost would  be the norm,  whereas  for branches  receiving 
less than 500,000  gals, per annum,  a 3p/gal.  cost would  be typical  (Fig. 7).

The present  position  in many  cases is that when some large suppliers  
leave branches  and transfer  to bulk, the branches  are changed  from the 
greater  than 500,000  gals, category  to the less than 500,000  gals, category.  
In other words,  the branch  creamery  system,  which is already  a very 
costly system  of assembly,  is becoming  even more costly. Both systems, 
branch  and bulk, are at their highest  cost when both are operating  side 
by side. It is surely  time that the final stage in implementing  bulk collec ­
tion was reached.

A Comparison  of the Economics  
of Milk Production  in 
Ireland  and Great  Britain
H. C. HUGHES
Extract  from the British  Milk Marketing  Board,  LCP Information  Unit
Report.
This extract  from the Report  compares  the results,  both physical  and 
financial,  for the two main samples  of farms in Ireland  and in England  
and Wales. It should  be remembered  that the results  are simple  averages  
and as such conceal  a wide range of individual  performance.
Physical  results
The physical  results  for the two samples  of farm are shown  in Table
1).

Coneentrate  use to young  stock (kg per LSU) 335 690
Stocking  rate (LSU per ha) 1.75 1.90
Nitrogen  use (kg per ha) 170 250
The farm size of the LCP sample  was 50 per cent greater  than that of 
the Irish sample. Land appeared  to be utilized  more intensively,  as 
measured  by a greater  rate of nitrogen  application  and a higher  stocking  
rate.
The management  of the herds as reflected  by milk yield and concen ­
trate input varied  widely,  the LCP farms obtaining  an extra 1,710 litres 
of milk per cow whilst  consuming  an additional  1,375 kg of concentrate.  
This pattern  reflected  a complete  dominance  of spring  calved  animals  in 
the Irish herds,  whilst  the LCP sample  comprised  animals  calving  at all
67
times  of the year. Further,  Ireland  has historically  suffered  low milk prices, 
encouraging  a low cost system,  while in the U.K. far more emphasis  has 
been placed  on yield per cow.
Financial  results
At the time of this study there was no difference  in the value of 
Irish and U.K. currency.  However  market  prices in the two countries  
differ; an outline of the cost of the major commodities  has been 
abstracted  from the two samples  (Table  2).

The most commonly  used measure  of dairy cow efficiency  is margin  
over concentrate,  made by combining  the physical  results  with the price 
levels indicated  above. This margin  for the Irish farms  was £292 per cow 
compared  with £295 in the case of the LCP sample.  These  figures  were  
surprisingly  similar  when one considers  the radically  different  approach  
to concentrate  feeding  coupled  with the difference  in milk output.
Incorporation  of the other costs and returns  attributable  to the dairy  
enterprise  enabled  construction  of the gross margin  shown in Table 3.

The greater  return  obtained  by the Irish for their calves  was balanced  
by a higher cost of replacement  heifers,  and their reluctance  to buy in 
roughage  feeds saved them £16 compared  with their LCP counterparts.  
The net result was an almost  identical  gross margin  per cow, but with 
the LCP herds being 75 per cent larger their total gross margin  was 
almost  £23,000  compared  with £13,000  for the Irish sample.
The whole farm gross margin  was obviously  influenced  by the mar­
gins made by other enterprises;  the Irish figures  in Table 4 being some ­
what higher than the LCP figure mainly  because  of the high transfer  
value of heifers  and the small amount  of concentrate  fed to them. This 
high transfer  value did at the same time reduce  the dairy herd margin.  
Coupling  the gross margins  with fixed costs enabled  a trading  account  
to be calculated  as shown  in Table  4.

The trading  account  shows that the Irish farms had substantially  
higher  profit  than the LCP sample.  This was despite  a smaller  herd size 
and a slightly  less favourable  milk price to concentrate  cost ratio. Thus,  
the Irish converted  a shortfall  of £7,500  in gross margin  to an advantage  
of over £4,000  in terms of profit. This disparity  was highlighted  by an 
examination  of the profit  achieved  per hectare.  A comparison  of each of 
the fixed cost items shows that the Irish are geared to a low input
69
approach,  as was seen earlier  in the case of concentrate.  This approach  
has been fostered  over the years when a relatively  low milk price was the 
order  of the day.
The period  between  1972 and 1978 has brought  a fourfold  increase  in 
milk price,  due to entry to the E.E.C.,  general  inflation,  and government  
action  over the green pound. The first two points  apply equally  to the 
UK but there remains  much greater  scope for price increase  by devalua ­
tion. Whilst  in the U.K.,  inflation  has put great pressure  on to the already  
high level of fixed costs,  in Ireland,  where  the costs  are historically  low, the 
effect  has been far less. Consequently  much  of the increased  milk revenue 
has immediately  been translated  into profit.
The cause of the large fixed costs in U.K. dairying  may well be that 
the LCP herds, in gearing  themselves  up to higher  yields, have at the 
same time adopted  systems  incurring  higher fixed costs, resulting  in 
decreased  rather  than increased  profits.
The low level of fixed costs recorded  on the Irish farms is surprising. 
Observation  of the equipment  on the farms  did however  explain  the posi­
tion. Very little fixed equipment  was present,  indicated  by the lower 
power,  machinery  and depreciation  charges.  Typically  the farmer  owned 
a second hand tractor  plus a fertiliser  distributor  and very little else. 
Major  tasks such as silage making  were often undertaken  by contractor.  
Whilst  most dairy cows were housed,  the buildings  used were simple  and 
intended  for only a relatively  short life. Further,  young  stock tended  to 
be outwintered  far more  than was the case in this country.  With almost  all 
land in Ireland  being owner-occupied  there was no rent to pay and with 
the majority  of land being in the family  for generations  there was little 
mortgage  commitment.  Further,  the low-key  nature of the businesses 
resulted  in very low bank borrowing.
The net result was that the fixed costs were one third of the level 
operating  in the LCP herds,  leading  to a profit of around  £12,500  com­
pared with the £8,000  obtained  by the LCP sample. However,  as was 
mentioned  above,  the Irish farms incurred  no rent and were less heavily 
committed  financially  than the LCP sample. Although  this is obviously 
important  when assessing  the returns  accruing  to the farmer  himself,  it is 
an unsatisfactory  measure  of business  efficiency.  A more  suitable  estimate  
can be made in terms of management  and investment  income  as shown 
in Table  5.
The difference  in profit was reduced  to some extent by the removal 
of the high interest  charges  prevailing  on LCP farms,  and imposition  of 
rental  charge  on the wholly  owner-occupied  Irish farms. Despite  this, the 
Irish sample  obtained  a management  and investment  income  30 per cent 
higher  than that prevailing  on the LCP farms. This was achieved  on a 
smaller  farm which was operating  a far simpler  system of dairy cow 
management.
Whilst  management  and investment  income  is commonly  used as a 
measure  of business  efficiency,  farmers  are more often concerned  with the 
cash position  of the business,  particularly  the availability  of cash to meet 
required  capital and private  expenditure.  A projection  of the trading

Cash surplus 3,171 -3,082
Note : (a) calculation  shown in Appendix  4
It can immediately  be seen from Table 6 that the difference  in profit  
was accentuated  in cash flow terms. The Irish farms  made a surplus  of 
over £3,000  whilst in contrast  their LCP counterparts  made a deficit  of 
£3,000.
This was partly due to the lower profit made by the LCP sample,  
aggravated  by a greater  proportion  of this profit being increase  in valua ­
71
tion, and also to the higher  commitments  of the LCP farms in terms of 
capital and private  expenditure.  Net capital investment  was markedly  
higher than that made by the Irish sample. This would appear  to be 
due to three reasons:  (1) the dairying  system  adopted  is far more inten ­
sive, thus requiring  greater  capital  investment  to maintain  itself; (2) the 
relatively  low profit levels perhaps  in certain  cases stimulate  investment  
to increase  the size of the business;  (3) increased  investment  is a means  
of reducing  the tax burden.
In Ireland,  however,  an extensive  dairying  system  is practiced  and, far­
mers paid no tax before 1974. Further,  the predominant  reaction  to low 
profits  in the past has been to tighten  the belt rather  than intensify.
However  whilst the LCP capital  expenditure  was higher  in absolute  
terms,  the figures  were almost  identical  on a per hectare  basis. This might  
be taken  as evidence  that the Irish, as a result  of current  profitability,  are 
now embarking  on a capital  improvement  programme.  Such expenditure  
will be further  encouraged  when the effects  of taxation  are realised.
The attitude  to capital  investment  was also reflected  in the approach  
to private  spending.  Despite  the large profit made in the current  year,  
private  spending  of £2,750  was small compared  with the £4,023  spent by 
LCP farmers.
Whilst  cash is important,  it may often be satisfactory  from a business 
point of view to increase  an overdraft  in particular,  or liabilities  in gene ­
ral, so long as asset values  are increasing  at a rate to compensate  both for 
this and inflation.  With the rapid escalation  in land values  over the past 
year, both samples  were able to achieve  this comfortably,  but a better  
assessment  of the business  position  of the two samples  can be made by 
comparing  the balance  sheets  at a single  point in time. (Table  7).
The most obvious  difference  was in land values,  mainly  due to the 
Irish being entirely  owner occupiers  whilst in the LCP sample  half of 
the land farmed  was rented.  Further,  land values  in Ireland  were higher  at 
around £4,500 per hectare compared  with an average  of £3,000 in 
England  and Wales. Otherwise  the most salient  point was the difference  
in liabilities,  the LCP sample  having  far higher levels of commitment,  
synonymous  with the more intensive  nature of the business  referred  to 
earlier. One aspect  of Irish policy with regard  to borrowing  seemed  to 
be a desire  to take as much money  as possible  in the form of a long-term 
loan. This contrasts  with the LCP sample  where  a much higher  propor-  
portion  of the borrowing  was taken  as bank overdraft.
Combining  the farm profitability,  as expressed  in terms of manage ­
ment and investment  income,  with the tenants  capital  taken from the 
balance  sheet showed  a return of 23 per cent for the Irish farms, as 
against  11 per cent for the LCP sample.  These  figures  confirm  the outline  
drawn  above  of a currently  more prosperous  Irish dairy industry.

Thus we have a picture  of Irish dairying  being on a solid financial  
base that has existed  for some time. However,  high profits  have now 
been added  to this foundation  and this is beginning  to reflect  in increased  
capital  investment  and private  drawings.  If current  levels of profit con­
tinue,  it seems  inevitable  that this change  will accelerate.

The Scope  for Irish Dairying  in an 
E.E.C.  Context
DR. T. O’DWYER
Milk Products  Division,  European  Economic  Communities,  Brussels.
The future of dairying  in Ire'and  is inevitably  and closely linked to 
policies  established  and pursued  at the European  level. Europe  now has 
a hand in virtually  every aspect  of dairying.  Yet perhaps  the strength  of 
those policies,  and sometimes  their weakness,  is the great bulk of econ ­
omic activity  which takes place within  the industry  with no direct  inter ­
ference from public bodies. The aspects of strength are primarily  
associated  with allowing  the economic  forces to take their normal  and 
natural  courses.  The weakness  is related  to the fact that so much public  
funds  are 'how involved  directly  and indirectly  in supporting  the industry  
that public bodies  at the European  level have a definite  obligation  in 
directing  the future  course  of the industry.  That obligation,  in particular,  
concerns  the growth  rates and future  size of the industry.  Recent  policy 
initiatives  by the Commission  are directed  primarily  towards  containing  
the overall size of the industry  within reasonable  limits and associate  
that industry  size with market  requirements.
Market  analysis
The market  situation  in the dairy sector has been analysed  in con­
siderable  depth in recent  years and especially  in COM (78) 430 final of 
the 25th September.  The salient  points in its conclusions  are that pro­
duction  continues  to increase  and demand  is at best static.
On the production  side, increases  in milk output  are almost  completely  
associated  with increases  in yield/cow.  Cow numbers  have been remark ­
ably stable  over the last decade  at about  25 million.  Yield  per cow which  
in the late sixties  would appear  to have been increasing  at about 1.7%  
per vear. increa.sed  by 2.5% in recent  years and in 1978 yield increased  
by 4%. It is Quite c'ear that yield is increasing  at an increasing  pace and 
no place has that been more true than in Ireland.  These yie’d increases  
are no doubt  resulting  from improved  breeding  but in particular  they are 
the resu't of better herd management  and improved  feeding,  especially  
using higher  levels of concentrate.  Even if the ratio of milk price/feed  
price doesn ’t improve  and perhaps  deteriorates  in the future,  yields  will 
continue  to increase  as more and more producers  get to appreciate  and 
understand  the economic  and technical  relationships  involved.
On the demand  side, the relationships  are much more complex  and 
segmented.  Basic consumer  habits differ widely  throughout  the Com ­
munity. The French consume  high levels of butter and cheese; the 
British  and Irish consume  a lot of butter and drink milk; the Italians  
drink wine, and their consumption  of cheese  is rather  low. Strong  pres­
77
sures exist, both naturally  and through  changing  life styles and through  
market  forces,  towards  reducing  butter  consumption.  Cream  and cheese  
consumption  continues  to increase.  Overall,  the Community  has been 
remarkably  successful  in maintaining  consumption  levels,  in milk equiv ­
alent terms,  in spite of the market  forces,  not improved  by the general  
sluggish  economies  throughout  Europe  and indeed  throughout  the world.
The end result,  in market  terms,  is one of ever increased  production  
and inilk deliveries  to dairies  and just about  static  demand.  The extent  of 
the inilk surplus  in the Community  was estimated  at 10% in 1976. It has 
continued  to increase  since. The extent  of surplus  perhaps  can be more 
strikin^y  expressed  in terms  of product.  Of the milk delivered  to dairies  
m the Community,  some 40% is converted  into butter  and skimmed  milk 
powder.  On the solids-non-fat  side, of the 2 million  tons of skimmed 
milk powder  produced,  some 90% is sold with levels  of support  varying  
between  45 and 90% of the intervention  price. When  skimmed  powder  is 
purchased  into intervention  at say 95 u.a./lOO  kg, it is stored  for say 2 
years,  costing  a further  24 u.a./ 100 kg and is then sold for incorporation  
into pig and poultry  rations  at about 15 u.a. /100 kg. It is surely  clear to 
most jieople  that this is not an economic  proposition  in the long term. 
Increasing  milk output is sometimes  rationalised  for Europe by the 
possibilities  which  exist for further  sales on the world market.
The Community  has already  a very large share of the world  market  in 
dairy produets.  The total world market  is very small compared  with 
world production.  In the developed  regions  of the world,  markets  are 
more than adequately  supplied  with domestic  production  and hence tend 
to be protected.  In the less developed  parts of the world,  the required  
infrastructure  does not exist, for handling  food aid from the Community.  
A considerable  backlog  of earlier  years ’ commitments  still remains  to 
be shipped.
In spite of that gloomy  picture  of the market  situation,  intervention  
stocks  of skimmed  milk powder  have been reduced  significantly  in recent 
years. While production  of powder  increased  by close to 200.000  tons 
in 19178, public  stocks  were reduced  by close to 300.000  tons. This was 
the direct result of the scope and efficiency  of the huge arsenal of 
measures  which the Commission  now has at its disposal  in this sector.  
However,  such an effort is at a large financial  cost hence we continue  
to strive  for more  effective  use of the funds  available.  From  a Communitv  
point of view intervention  tends to be very expensive  and it is much 
less costly if the skimmed  milk can be used directly  for say pig feed 
thus avoiding  the costs  involved  in drying,  financing  and storage.
Against  this background,  it is important  to understand  the dilemma  
racing  the Community  in this sector. It is not just sufficient  to focus on 
the financial  costs which run to some 42% of the Community  budget  in 
agriculture  and 28% of the overall  Community  budget. Some 20% of 
the producers  milk price is accounted  for by this budgetary  input Yet 
m the light of the foregoing  market  situation  and market  return  it surely 
justify  further  expanding  milk output  on a Community
78
d)Policy  objectives  and constraints
In the light of the above situation  the Commission  spelt out its 
objectives  and the guidelines  within  which policy should  be formulated  
over the next years. These  policy  guidelines  are as follows  :
a) to stop the increase  in milk production,
b) to avoid all measures  which run contrary  to this objective  and, in 
particular,  all aids to investment  given by public  funds  at the Com ­
munity  or national  level, which  favour  higher  production  and which  
are still given  at the level of the farm and at the level of the processing  
and marketing  enterprises,
c) to put the stress,  where possible,  on measures  which allow the level 
of consumption  to be maintained,  to increase  the outlets  for milk and 
to reduce  the milk production  potential,
to take the necessary  additional  measures  which  will take account  of 
the social situation  of small milk producers  working  in particularly  
difficult  conditions.
The Commission  also indicated  that these guidelines  would be im­
plemented  against  the background  of a number  of constraints  facing  the 
Community,  which effectively  limit the possibilities  for action. These  
restraints  have been identified  as follows  ;
a) The price relation  between  milk fat and protein  and vegetable  fat 
and vegetable  protein  which is influenced  by the differing  levels of 
external  protection.
The socio-economic  situation  of many small producers  farming  in 
regions  which  offer hardly  any alternative  possibilities.
The limited  outlets  available  on the world market,  either because  of 
restrictions  in certain  third countries  or because  of the high cost of 
additional  exports.
The continuation  of agri monetary  measures.
The general  economic  situation  in the Community  which  is character ­
ised by a high level of unemployment.b)

Commission  proposals
It was in the light of these guidelines  and constraints,  which  seem to 
be generally  understood  throughout  the Community,  that the Commission  
recently  made its proposals  to the Council.  The essential  elements  of 
these proposals  are :
1) No price increase
2) Co-responsibility
3) Continuation  of non-marketing  and conversion  premia
4) Temporary  suspension  of investment  aids
5) Aids to consumption.
1) Price: Price is an essential  element  of any policy aimed at 
reducing  the incentives  for any increase  in output. One may well argue  
about  the degree  of response  to price but there is little argument  about  
its direction.  Individual  producers  in the short term may well increase  
output  in order to maintain  income,  but globally  the response  must be 
of a classical  nature. Maintaining  price over a period is an effective  
decrease  in real terms. However,  production  technology  continues  to
79
advance.  Hence the impact of a non increase  in price is somewhat  
limited,  especially  when green rates are likely to ehange.  This in no way 
detracts  from the importance  of price in policy formulation  and in 
attempting  to bring a better  equilibrium  between  milk output  and con­
sumption  at a Community  level. Although  price is an essential  and 
necessary  element  of pwlicy it is not adequate  to deal with the current  
market  situation.
2) Coresponsibilify  levy : In recognizing  that price in itself is not 
adequate  as a means  of solving  the milk problem,  the Commission  was 
then faced with a series of options  which perhaps  could be summarized  
in the following  list :
a) Quota  arrangements —global  or individual
b) Reduction  of intervention  prices
c) Levy.
a) Quotas  : The Commission ’s view on this point is clearly  expressed 
in COM(78)  430, p. 26, paragraph  48 “Although  a system  of quotas  could 
have an immediate  effect, the Commission  is not in favour  of such a 
system. Such measures  would  be difficult  to reconcile  with the Commun ­
ity’s approach  based on free decision  and internal  trade; it would be 
almost  impossible  to construct  such a policy  without  some inequity  be­
tween different  producers  or regions  of the Community;  production  
quotas  tend to fossilize  the existing  structure;  quotas  would  be extremely  
difficult  to negotiate  and even more difficult  to change,  and consequently  
there is a risk that in due course there would be a return to surplus  
production ”. The substance  of that paragraph  cannot  be refuted  but it 
should  be c'early  recognized  that quotas  are a practical  approach  to the 
problem.  Since they are likely to breakdown  to a member  state division 
of entitlements  in one wav or another,  they are therefore  likely to be 
acceptable  to a number  of member  state administrations.  Hence those 
who fear the imp'ementation  of quotas should be the first to work  
towards  realistic  policy  alternatives.
b) Reduction  of intervention  prices  : Last vear the Commission  pro­
posed a temporary  suspension  of intervention  buying  for skimmed  milk 
powder  during  the winter  months.  It did so in the belief that prices  for 
the skim sector could be maintained  without  reliance  on intervention  
buying  throughout  the year. It did so also with a view to removing  one 
of the unnecessarily  high cost elements  in the milk sector even for a 
limited  period. Other reasons  were to encourage  people to use liquid 
skim directly  for feeding  and to introduce  at least some slight element  
of uncertainty  into the milk market. The proposal,  though  gaining  very 
considerable  support  in the Council,  was not accepted.
The Commission  thus examined  the related approach  of linking  
intervention  buying-in  prices to levels of milk output. As milk output  
increased,  buying-in  prices wou'd be reduced  by a related percentage.  
Such an approach  wou ’d be logical  economically  and would  have a direct  
impact both on producers  and consumers.  It is the tried and tested 
classical  approach  to output  problems  in an industry.  It has the further  
advantage  of being  simple  and straight  forward  to administer and control.
80
It would be the Commission ’s intention  to have had such an approach  
being  adopted  to protect  the ^cio-economic  weaker  sector  of the industry  
from a too drastic change in their situation.  Nevertheless,  the clear  
reaction  to that option  by the member  states  since the Commission  put it 
forward  as a possibility  last September  has been negative.  The interven ­
tion system,  rather  than perhaps  the objective  which lies behind  it, has 
become  sacrosanct.
c) Levy proposals : The option chosen by the Commission  in the 
light of the analysis  and consultations  undertaken  is that of a new ap­
proach  to the coreponsibility  levy. The essential  elements  are as follows ;
i) Level  would be associated  with the changes  in milk output  on a 
Community  basis. For every one per cent increase  in milk output,  
the levy would  be two per cent subject  to a continuing  minimum  of 
two per cent. Transitional  measures  would be established  for the 
period 1st June 1979 to 31st January  1980. The reference  periods  
would  remain  constant  thereafter.  The elements  are shown  in Table  
1.

1.2-79-31.5.791.2.80-31.5.80 1.10.80-31.1.81 2
After the transitional  period of eight months  ending  31.1.1980,  the 
reference  periods  wouM remain  fixed, the base periods  would be 
moved  forward  annually.  Milk deliveries  in the appropriate  base 
period  would  be compared  with the average  deliveries  in the approp ­
riate reference  period and the increase  in deliveries  in percentage  
terms would be multiplied  by the relevant  coefficient  to arrive at 
the level of levy, as a percent  of the target  price which  would  be ap­
plicable  for a further  four month  period. The ground  rules would  
thus be established  by the Council  and the system would have a 
considerable  degree  of automaticity  in the long term while providing  
for some variability  between  application  periods.
81
ii) With a view to protecting  the income  of small producers  with few 
other alternatives  to milk production,  a system  of exemptions  on the 
following  basis are provided  for :
— principal  occupation  is farming,
— under  55 years  of age or between  55 and 60 years  of age and enter  
into a commitment  to cease farming  at the age of 60 years,  con- 
sistant  with directive,  72/160,
— deliver  not more than 60,000  litres of milk per year,
— agricultural  holding  not more than 25 hectares,
— undertake  not to increase  their number  of dairy cows,
— not have more than one dairy cow per hectare.
This approach  can certainly  safeguard  the income  of small farmers  
while having  some deference  to the intensity  of farming  and thereby  
to the use of concentrates.  Commission  estimates  indicate  that when  
these exemptions  are combined  with those presently  existing  in the 
“hill” regions  and southern  Italy,  some 28 f)er cent of milk producers  
delivering  some 12 per cent of the milk would in fact be exempt.  
The corresponding  figures  in Ireland  are 18 per cent and 8 per cent,  
respectively.
iii) The corresponsibility  group would continue  to advise  the Commis ­
sion on the promotion,  advertising  and research  programmes  which  
should  be continued  at about  the present  level.
iv) Such an approach  to the levy is likely in the Commission ’s view to 
be effective  as a disincentive  to further  increases  in milk output  on 
a Community  basis. It is also equitable  between  producers  and 
makes  a great deal of economic  sense.
3) Non marketing  and conversion  premia  : Though  the results  todate  
have not been startling,  nevertheless,  this programme  has had a con­
siderable  degree of success. Up to the end of December  1978, some  
700,000  cows have been accounted  for which reduces  the potential  for 
milk output  by fairly  close to 3%. The response  has been very different  
between  member  states and even between  regions  within  member  states.  
In general,  most people  are favourable  towards  it. Farm leaders  and 
national  administratons  who strongly  favour  its continuity  and enlarge ­
ment are particularly  impressed  with the need for its acceptance,  applica ­
tion and encouragement  in member  states other than their own. This 
type of programme  can be very effective  if the premiums  are high 
enough;  but also if unemployment  benefits  were high enough  nobody  
would  need to work. Where  would  the money  come from ? However,  it 
is proposed  to continue  it for another  year and to the extent that the 
total programme  proposed  by the Commission  is adopted  by the Council,  
it is likely to become  attractive  to a larger  group  of producers  who have 
some other uses for their available  resources.
4) Temporary  suspension  of investment  aids : It appears  totally  
illogical  to continue  to use Community  and national  public  funds  at farm  
and factory  level to further  enlarge  the size of the industry  at a time when 
the central  objective  of any reasonable  policy  in this sector  inevitably  has 
to be to limit its future  growth  to a minimum.  Hence  the Commission ’s 
proposal  for suspension  of aids to investment  at all levels  of the industry,
82
subject  to some exceptions  in very particular  cases. The proposal  is not, 
as has been suggested,  that all investment  should cease but that this 
investment  should  not be assisted  from public  funds. It seems  even more  
illogical  that the member  states (who shall be nameless  !) who claim to 
have a comparative  advantage  in milk production  and who claim to 
produce  milk more efficiently  than anybody  else, should  be foremost  in 
their  opposition  to this proposal.  It would  appear  to be difficult  to defend  
aids to investment  at the manufacturing  level in circumstances  when  
most of the aids heretofore  granted  at that level have yet to be taken up. 
There is little doubt but that all investment  aids in recent  years in this 
sector have led either directly  or indirectly  to further  increases  in milk 
output.
5) Aids to consumption : It has already  been indicated  that adequate  
measures  are now available  to meet the requirements  as they arise in the 
skim sector. However  the butter  sector  is the cause  of increasing  concern  
as stocks rise steadily. In spite of high export refunds  for butter and 
butter  oil, sales at reduced  prices  for pastry  and ice cream  manufacture,  
sales to armies  and non-profit  making  institutions,  for the manufacture  of 
butter concentrate  and reduced  prices for butter for people on social  
assistance,  some further  measures  are clearly  necessary.  Short  term sales 
at reduced  prices,  the so-called  Christmas  butter schemes,  were reason ­
ably successful  in 1977 and 1978—but much more so in the former  than 
the latter. In view of this, the Commission  is proposing  an enlarged  
general  butter subsidy  scheme. Whereas  under present  legislation,  if 
member  states grant a butter  subsidy  of 56 u.a./ 100 kg, the Community  
contribution  is 23 u.a. On the basis of the Commission ’s proposal,  at 
the level of 56 u.a., the Community  contribution  would  be 42 u.a. /100 kg. 
Such a scheme  should  be attractive  to a number  of member  states  besides 
those already  implementing  the butter  subsidy  scheme.
Implications  for Irish dairying
The above paragraphs  outline  the environment  within  which,  on the 
basis of the Commission ’s proposals,  the Irish dairy industry  will be 
operating  in the future. It is an environment  where prices  in real terms  
shall decrease  somewhat  and where aids to further  investment  shall be 
considerably  limited. It is also a situation  where a levy on milk, asso­
ciated  with the level of changes  in milk output  at the Community  level, 
will become  an integral  part of Community  policy. The level of the levy 
should  be such as to provide  a real disincentive  to further  increases  in 
global milk output. Small farmers,  with no other alternatives,  will find 
their income  situation  adequately  protected.  Milk will continue  to be a 
profitable  business  at all levels for those operating  efficiently.  Total out­
put will to a continuing  degree have to be associated  with market  
requirements.  Producers  under  the above proposals  can plan on a sound 
and constructive  policy  being implemented  well into the future  providing  
adequate  scope for enterprise  and technical  and managerial  ability. The 
policy  provides  for equity  between  producers  right throughout  the Com ­
munity  under their varying  circumstances  and thus taking  into account  
their long-term  interests.

EIGHTH  EDWARD  RICHARDS-ORPEN  MEMORIAL  LECTURE
Some  Aspects  of Recent  Research  
in Dairying

Introduction
I would like to sincerely  thank the Trustees  of the Edward  Richards-  
Orpen Memorial  Trust for inviting  me to present  this Eighth  Memorial  
Lecture.  When  I received  the invitation  I recognised  that it would  not be 
an easy task to pre.sent  a lecture  fitting to the memory  of such a person  
as Mr. Richards-Orpen  about  whom  I have read so many  tributes.  Never ­
theless  I felt that I must accept  the invitation  if the dairy industry  is to 
benefit  from the total research  effort which is being expended  under the 
the favourable  grass-growing  conditions  which  we enjoy throughout  Ire­
land. Indeed  it is because  of this importance  of grass in our ruminant  
based systems  that so much of the nutritional  research  work carried  out 
in other countries,  such as Great Britain,  is of relatively  little direct  value  
in our environment.
The tremendous  potential  for grass  growth,  and hence  animal  produc ­
tion, from grassland  in Ireland  has been recognised  for many years but, 
even yet, I do not think that this is fully appreciated  let alone exploited.  
For example,  the yields of grass dry matter  recorded  in variety  testing  
work at Crossnacreevy  near Belfast  is 60 per cent greater  than the average  
of the other sites for similar  trials throughout  the United  Kingdom  (1).
When research  in dairying  was initiated  at Hillsborough  ten years 
ago it was considered  that the major  effort must be devoted  to exploiting  
this potential  of grass or grass products.  During  this period  a number  of 
different  aspects  have been investigated,  but I intend  to speak  only on the 
following  three areas :
1. Development  of a spring-calving  system.
2. Silage  quality.
3. Protein  nutrition  on indoor  diets.
While the research  work carried  out under 1 above  has been concerned  
solely  with a specific  system,  that under  2 and 3 has been of a more gene ­
ral nature and has implications  for dairy management  irrespective  of 
season  of calving.
1. Development  of a spring  calving  system
In any grass-growing  environment  in which  efficient  milk production  
is required  it is obvious  that a system  which  attempts  to match  the chang ­
ing requirements  of the dairy cow throughout  it’s lactation  to the quantity

and quality  of the feed available  must be of major importance.  This is 
the basis of the spring-calving  system  and for this reason  a considerable  
part of our research  programme  at Hillsborough  has been devoted  to 
developing  such a system. However,  as all those involved  in research  are 
aware,  a research  programme  aimed  at establishing  optimum  systems  for 
any type of animal  production  is extremely  difficult.  This difficulty  arises 
not only because  of the problems  brought  about by the large scale and 
long-term  nature  of the trials, but also because  some basic assumptions  
must be made when establishing  the ‘bare framework ’ of the system  on 
which to build the details. In the present  context  the basis framework  
consisted  of making  broad  decisions  on the calving  pattern  to be adopted,  
the time at which animals  are likely to be able to go to pasture  in the 
spring  and the type of conserved  grass to be used for winter  feed. An 
example  of the implications  of these decisions  is demonstrated  by the fact 
that if a research  programme  was superimposed  on a system  based on 
hay as against  silage for the winter  feed this would affect the answers  
which  would  be obtained  to questions  such as what is the optimum  level 
of nitrogen  fertiliser  and optimum  concentrate  inputs. We assumed  that 
the basic  system  would  have the following  framework :
I. Due to ground  conditions  prevailing  in the North  of Ireland  animals  
will require  to be maintained  indoors  for a minimum  period  of five 
months  and will not be at pasture  until early or mid-April.
Grass  conserved  as silage  should  be the basal winter  diet as it allows  a 
greater  exploitation  of the growth  potential  of grass.
Calving  should  commence  on January  1st and be as compact  as pos­
sible thereafter.
The decision  to calve  early,  relative  to the onset of the grazing  period,  
was based primarily  on the fact that information  produced  by Wood  (2) 
from a survey  of milk yield data from the Milk Marketing  Board for 
England  and Wales  demonstrated  that there was a consistent  decline  in 
lactation  yield with progressively  later calving  after January.  This was 
later confirmed  in an analysis  of data from Hillsborough  (3) which 
showed  a mean decline  in lactation  yield of 220 kg for each month ’s 
delay in calving  between  January  1st and April 1st. A relatively  similar  
decline  of 180 kg/month  has been reported  by Cunningham  (4).
Commencing  with this basic system,  revolving  around  block-calving  
starting  on January  1st, giving  grass silage as the basal diet during  the 
winter period and grazing  pasture  from early April until grass growth  
declines  or land becomes  too wet for grazing  in the autmn,  the object  has 
been to establish  the optimum  inputs  of some of the major  variables  in 
the system. These  include  the amount  of nitrogen  fertiliser  which  should  
be applied  to the grass,  the stocking  rate to be used and the quantity  of 
concentrate  required  to supplement  the basal diets of silage  or grass.2.

Nitrogen  for grazed  pasture
The optimum  level of any input is dictated  by the cost of that input  
relative  to the value of the product  produced,  coupled  with the response 
relationship  between  the input and the product  output. In the case of 
fertiliser  nitrogen  this response  relationship  has been the subject  of more
86
discussion  and debate  over the past 20 years than probably  any other  
input. The response  to nitrogen  has been measured  in terms  of grass dry 
matter  output  in many  grass  cutting  experiments,  but a smaller  number  of 
experiments  have been designed  to assess  the response  in terms  of animal  
output  either as milk or beef. Currently  our thinking  is based on the 
results  from a three year trial, carried  out by my former  colleague  Roger  
Marsh  at Hillsborough  (5) during  the early 1970 ’s, in which  he character ­
ised the relationship  between  nitrogen  input and beef output. This rela­
tionship  indicated  that a substantial  response  in animal product  was 
obtained  up to about 400 kg nitrogen  per hectare. In earlier  work (6) 
carried  out with dairy cows, again over a three year period,  grazed  on 
pasture  receiving  400 and 700 kg nitrogen  per hectare  a marginal  increase  
of only 7 per cent in milk output  at the higher  nitrogen  level was detected.  
The combination  of these two studies  led us to the conclusion  that the 
optimum  nitrogen  input for grazing  under intensive  stocking  conditions  
was likely to be of the order of 400-450 /kg per hectare  and this, there ­
fore, was the level adopted  in the system.  It is recognised,  however,  that 
this recommendation  is not in line with recommendations  in the Republic  
of Ireland  and this is a source  of some concern.  For example  McFeely,  
Butler  and Gleeson  (7) have recommended  a maximum  nitrogen  input of 
250 kg per hectare  with intensive  dairying,  while Collins,  Drennan  and 
Flynn (8) have stated that it is difficult  to recommend  levels of nitrogen  
above 120 kg per hectare  for beef cattle. This disparity  in recommenda ­
tions cannot  be taken lightly  and because  of its importance  we hope in 
the present  year to re-examine  the response  to nitrogen  through  the dairy  
cow.
Nitrogen  for conserved  grass
As ground  conditions  in Northern  Ireland  require  that dairy cows be 
housed  for a period  ranging  from 5 - 6 months  each year there is a very 
large requirement  for conserved  forage. In the practical  context  this may 
best be achieved  through  the use of specialised  conservation  area man­
aged separately  from the grazing  area rather than trying to integrate  
conservation  and grazing  into a single system. With this approach  the 
optimum  nitrogen  input for conservation  can be determined  directly  from 
cutting  trials and an example  of the results  obtained  from one such trial 
carried  out at Hillsborough  (9) is given in Table 1.

200 9910
400 12570
600 14290
800 14730
87
From results  of this type it has been concluded  that the response  of cut 
herbage  to nitrogen  is considerable,  even to levels above 400 kg per 
hectare,  and that this sort of level can be readily  adopted  for conserva ­
tion.
Stocking  rate at pasture
The optimum  stocking  rate in any dairying  system  will obviously  be a 
function  of the quantity  of grass which  can be produced  per hectare  and 
the nutritional  requirements  of the animals  utilising  this grass. With the 
levels  of nitrogen  used at Hillsborough  relatively  high yields  of grass dry 
matter  are achieved  with amounts  of around 11,000  kg dry matter  per 
hectare  consumed  by cows being regularly  recorded  (10). If a metabol-  
isible energy  value for grass of 11.5 MJ per kg dry matter  is assumed,  
the level of grass energy  output  per hectare  should  be capable  of sup­
porting  around  5.0 cows producing  an average  daily milk yield over the 
the grazing  period  of 15 kg, while  at the same time gaining  in bodyweight  
at the rate of 0.4 kg per day (using  the ME requirements  of Friesian  
cows as given by MAFF,  DAFS  and DANI)  (11). In the first two years 
of our stocking  rate experiments  rates of 6.4 and 4.9 cows per hectare  
over the grazing  season  (3.2 and 2.7 cows per hectare  including  the con­
servation  area) were examined  (12). The results  obtained  from these are 
given under  Experiment  1 in Table  2.
Table 2

Milk output  kg/ha) 16502 14064

Milk output/cow  at pasture  (kg) 2963 3181
Overall  stocking  rate—including  conservation  (cows/ha) 3.0 2.5
In summary  it was found that, while  the output  of milk produced  per 
hectare  of grazing  area was increased  by 17 per cent through  the use of 
the higher  stocking  rate, performance  per animal  was reduced  by about  
11 per cent. From these results  it was concluded  that, while the higher  
stocking  resulted  in a very high milk output  of over 16,500  kg per hectare,  
the depression  in performance  per cow at 276 kg was too great  to be used 
in the practical  context. However  when the lactation  curves of both 
groups  were compared,  it was apparent  that the use of a high stocking 
rate in early season  did not reduce  milk output  during  that period and
88
that the reduction  in milk yield per animal  only occurred  from late June  
onwards.  This led to the approach  of maintaining  high stocking  rates of 
about  6.4 cows per hectare  during  the early  part of the grazing  season  and 
reducing  this in steps as the rate of grass growth  declined  by introducing  
additional  land from the conservation  area to finish at around  4.9 cows  
per hectare  by late September.  By this approach  a high output  of milk 
per hectare  can be achieved  without  depressing  the performance  of the 
individual  animal  too severely.  An example  of the results  obtained  using  
this method  is given  in Table  2 (Experiment  2), in which  the mean  stock ­
ing rate of 5.6 cows per hectare  was obtained  by the systein  outlined  of 
starting  the grazing  season  at 6.4 cows per hectare  and finishing  at 4.9 
cows per hectare  (10). These results  indicate  that a very high level of 
milk output  per hectare  at 16,985  kg could  be produced  with a depression  
in individual  animal  yield of about  7 per cent.
While  the approach  outlined  above  goes some way towards  producing  
high outputs  of milk per hectare  without  reducing  yield per cow too 
severely,  it must be recognised  that the conflict  between  high output  per 
hectare  and high output  per cow remains  one of the major  problems  in 
grass utilisation  and the problem  is likely  to increase  as we steadily  move 
towards  higher  yielding  cows.
There  have been various  attempts  to solve this problem  by manipula ­
tion of the grazing  system. Examples  of this have been the adoption  of 
systems  which  allowed  the higher-yielding  cows to selectively  graze  ahead  
of lower producers  and the use of systems  which  alternated  grazing  and 
cutting.  Neither  of these approaches  seem to offer much  hope  of success.  
An experiment  has also just been completed  at Hillsborough  investigat ­
ing another  approach  (10). To achieve  high outputs  of milk per hectare  
requires  firstly good grass growth  and, secondly,  that grass is grazed  
fairly severely  to ensure  that most of the grass is utilised.  However  it is 
known  that grazing  herbage  severely  reduces  grass intake  per cow and 
hence milk output  per cow. It was felt, therefore,  that if a system  was 
used which  only severely  defoliated  the sward  at intervals  rather  than at 
each grazing  the depression  in yield per cow might be lessened.  In the 
exfjeriment  a conventional  system,  which  involved  a severe  defoliation  at 
each grazing,  was compared  with two systems  in which the sward was 
severely  defoliated  at either alternate  or every third grazing.  All three  
systems  were maintained  at equal stocking  rates. The preliminary  results  
are given in Table 3.
These results show no advantage  for either of the two experimental  
grazing  systems.  In 1977, when the stocking  rate was sufficiently  high 
to depress  yield per animal  by 10 per cent on the conventional  system,  
there appeared  to be some advantage  from the system  where  severe  de­
foliation  was carried  out at every third grazing.  A similar  effect was not 
obtained  in 1978 but this may have been due to good grass  growth  in that 
year resulting  in a low depression  in yield per cow at the higher  stocking  
rate of only 4 per cent. It seems unlikely,  therefore,  that this approach  
of alternating  lax and severe  grazing  will offer any scope  for improvement  
although  I feel that the general  concept  still merits  some research  consi ­
deration.

Level  of concentrate  supplementation  during  the indoor  period
Where the winter  diet of the spring-calving  cow is to be based on 
silage the nutrient  requirement  of the fresh calved animal  will exceed 
those that can be supplied  from silage alone and the deficiency  has to be 
remedied  by the use of supplementary  concentrates.  However  the ques ­
tion of how much concentrate  to feed during  this period  is continually  a 
rnatter  for debate.  It could  be argued  that the quantity  can be determined  
simply  from a calculation  based on the theoretical  requirements  of the 
animal  and a knowledge  of the nutritive  value of the feeds. While such 
an approach  may satisfy  the nutritionist  it may not necessarily  provide  
the correct  answer  in terms of economics.  This can only be determined  
by firstly establishing  the way in which the animal  will respond  to a 
change  in concentrate  input and from this deciding  the optimum  econo ­
mic level of supplementation.  A series of three experiments  has been 
carried  out at Hillsborough  in order to provide  data on the response  in 
milk output  to a change  in concentrate  input. In all of these studies 
cows have had ad libitum  access  to medium-good  quality  grass silage  with 
“D”-values  of the order of 65 - 67 and metabolisable  energy  contents  of 
about 10.0 MJ per kg dry matter. No concentrates  were given prior to 
calving  and in each year the animals  have calved  from early January  until 
early March,  with a mean calving  date of between  January  18-25th  in 
any year. In each year the animals  went to pasture  during  early-mid  
April.
In Experiment  1 three levels of concentrate  of 3.8, 5.5 and 7.2 kg per 
day were used from calving until going to pasture in each of two 
years (13). At pasture  the cows were grazed  at a mean stocking  rate of
5.5 cows per hectare  without  any concentrate  supplementation  other than
90
for 7 - 10 days after turn out in the spring. The results  obtained  are given 
in Table  4.

Liveweight  at end of lactation  (kg) 606 606
Increasing  the concentrate  input not only increased  milk yield indoors  
but also resulted  in substantially  more milk being  produced  at grass. The 
overall  effect was therefore  that the higher  concentrate  input provided  
the greatest  economic  return.
In Experiment  2 a higher  level of supplementation  of 9.5 kg per day 
was compared  with that of 7 kg per day which  had been found  to be best 
in the previous  trial (12). Again  the experiment  was carried  out over a 
two year period  and the animals  were grazed  at a mean stocking  rate of 
5.7 cows per hectare.  The results  in Table  4 show that, while the higher  
level of concentrate  feeding  indoors  increased  the quantity  of milk pro­
duced during  the indoor  period,  it did not improve  total lactation  yield  
because  the animals  on the higher level of supplementation  tended  to 
produce  less at pasture.  The result  was obtained  even though  theoretical  
calculations  of nutrient  requirements  indicated  that the higher  level of 
supplementation  was the more nutritionally  correct  diet.
Because  of the scepticism  for these results  displayed  by those con­
cerned  with high concentrate  inputs  a further  experiment  was undertaken  
to examine  further  high concentrate  inputs  (14). In this trial (Experiment

3) 7.2 kg per day of concentrate  was compared  with a higher  input than 
that used previously  at 10.5 kg per day. The results  obtained  are given 
in Table 4. Again the higher concentrate  input increased  milk output  
indoors,  but reduced  the subsequent  performance  at pasture  with the 
net effect being  that total lactation  yield was not improved.
The conclusion  from this series of experiments  must be that when  
good quality  silage,  given ad libitum,  forms the basal diet the optimum  
level of concentrate  supplementation  is around  7.2 kg per day. Higher  
levels  than this cannot  be justified  even with animals  giving  5,100  kg milk 
per lactation,  which is the mean yield of all animals  used over the five 
year experimental  programme.
Pattern  of concentrate  supplementation
The research  work described  previously  had clearly  established  the 
optimum  level of concentrates.  However  the question  arises  as to whether  
concentrates  should  be allocated  at the same level per day from calving  
until going to pasture  or whether  it would be better to allocate  more  
concentrates  immediately  post-calving  in order to stimulate  production  
at the commencement  of lactation. For example  Broster  and his col­
leagues  at the National  Institute  for Research  in Dairying  (15) have sug­
gested that improved  feeding  during  the first four weeks after calving  
has a substantial  beneficial  effect  on production  throughout  the remainder  
of the lactation. A two year experiment  was therefore  undertaken  to 
compare  a flat-rate  feeding  system  in which each animal  received  the 
same level of concentrates  per day from calving  until going to pasture  
with a high/low  system  in which much higher  amounts  of concentrates  
were given  during  the first four weeks  after calving  (14). All animals  had 
access  to the same silage  and the total input of concentrates  was similar.  
The results  are given in Table  5.
Table 5
Effect  of pattern  of concentrate  allocation  after calving
Concentrate  allocation  system Flat rate High/low
Total concentrate  input (kg) 412 402
Milk yield indoors  (kg) 1851 1848
Milk yield at pasture  (kg) 3170 3048
Total lactation  yield (kg) 5021 4893
These  results  showed  that adopting  a high/low  system  had no beneficial 
effect on either  the amount  of milk produced  indoors  or during  the total 
lactation.  This, therefore,  eliminates  the need to use high concentrate  
inputs  during  the post-calving  period  when  digestive  upsets  are frequently  
encountered.
In this comparison  all animals  within each treatment  received  the 
same amount  of concentrates  irrespective  of the yield of the individual
93
cow. In a further  experiment  a flat-rate  feeding  system  in which  all ani­
mals received  the same quantity  of concentrates  was compared  with a 
high/low  system in which the concentrate  input for each animal  was 
related  to its milk yield with high yielding  animals  receiving  more and 
low yielders  less concentrate  (16). The effect on milk yield is shown  in 
Table  6.

Milk yield indoors  (kg) 1946 1954
Mean  yield after 10 wks. at pasture  (kg/d) 18.4 18.5
There was no effect of system  of allocation  on milk output  during  the 
indoor  period  and, while the experiment  did not embrace  a full lactation,  
the performance  during  the first ten weeks  at pasture  did not show any 
difference  in residual  effects.
The results of this and the previous  experiment  show that with a 
spring  calving  system  a uniform  daily feed allowance,  irrespective  of stage  
of lactation  and milk yield potential  of the individual  cow, will produce  
equivalent  results  compared  with more complicated  systems  which  either  
aim to achieve  high peak yields  or allocate  feed according  to milk yield.
Concentrate  supplementation  at pasture
The use of concentrates  as a supplement  for dairy cows at pasture  has 
been a feature  of the U.K. dairy industry  for many years. This practice  
has been founded  on a continual  attempt  by the dairy farmer  to provide  
for the nutritional  requirements  of the lactating  animal.  However  it must 
be appreciated  that the short term nutritional  requirements  of the animal  
are of much less importance  than is the economic  response  to any addi­
tional feed given,  provided  the long term nutrition  and health is not im­
paired. Leaver,  Campling  and Holmes  (17) reviewed  the results from 
experiments  in which  the response  in milk yield to concentrates  given at 
grass  had been assessed  and, in general,  the results  indicated  that between 
2 to 5 kg concentrates  were required  to produce  an extra 1 kg milk. How ­
ever most of the experiments  were conducted  with cows which  were not 
in early lactation  and high yielding  with the result that critics  have sug­
gested that the findings  may not be applicable  to the higher-yielding,  
spring-calving  cow. For this reason  an experiment  was carried  out at 
Hillsborough  to examine  the response  from cows calving  during  March  
and April (18). These cows were producing  on average  28 kg milk per 
day prior to going  to pasture  and were grazed  together  as a single  group  
at a stocking  rate of 5.5 cows per hectare  throughout  the experiment  
which  lasted for 14 weeks. The cows were given three levels of cereal-  
based supplement  of 0.45, 2.25 and 4.05 kg per day. There  was a good
94
supply  of grass available  throujghout  the experiment.  The mean perfor ­
mance  over the period  is given in Table  7.

These results  show that even with high-yielding,  spring-calving  cows  
the response  to additional  concentrates  when ample  grass is available  is 
extremely  low. It has now been shown  conclusively  that the major  reason  
for this small response  to supplements  at grass is due to the supplement  
depressing  the intake of herbage  by the aiiimal  with the net result that 
the total nutrient  intake  is only marginally  increased.  It has been argued  
that, while cereals  result in a considerable  depression  in herbage  intake,  
the effect could be reduced  by using supplements  which are more com­
plementary  to the digestion  of forages  in the rumen. Dried  grass was felt 
to be a possibility  and some work has been carried  out at Hillsborough  
to examine  if the inclusion  of this forage  in the supplement  mix, or giving  
a sole supplement  of dried grass, would improve  performance  (19). In 
essence  the results  have shown  that neither  the use of dried grass on its 
own nor it’s inclusion  as a proportion  of the supplment  has improved  the 
response  at pasture.
The above  results  demonstrated  clearly  that when  there  was a reason ­
able supply  of grass, concentrate  supplementation,  even to high-yielding  
animals,  was of no economic  benefit.  However  there are occasions  when  
grass is in short supply  and it seems  likely  that in such circumstances  the 
response  to supplementation  would  be greater.  Such circumstances  arose  
during  the very dry summer  period  in 1976 when  the rate of grass  growth  
was extremely  low. During  this period  of grass shortage  a trial was set 
up to assess  the effect  of providing  supplementary  feed (20). Three  treat ­
ments were applied  to a group of cows grazing  as a single group at a 
stocking  rate of approximately  4.5 cows per hectare.  In one treatment  no 
supplement  was provided  while in the other  two treatrrients  4 kg per day 
of a supplement  containing  9 or 21 per cent crude  protein  was given. The 
results  obtained  are given in Table  8.

The milk yield response  to both supplements  was considerably  greater  
than those  normally  reported  due to the very limited  supply  of grass avail ­
able. However  even in such circumstances  the response  of 0.6 and 0.8 
kg milk per kg of concentrates  for the high and low protein  supplements  
respectively  did not increase  the profitability  of milk production.  It may, 
however,  be worth  noting  that the response  tended  to be greater  with the 
higher  protein  supplement  and this is an area which  could merit research  
work if for any reason in the future supplements  should be used at 
pasture.
Performance  of spring-calving  system
The foregoing  discussion  has been concerned  with an examination  of 
the individual  components  of the spring-calving  system. However  
throughout  this experimental  programme  attempts  have been made to 
incorporate  each aspect into an overall  system  of management  for the 
existing  herd. The system  now adopted  therefore  incorporates  these re­
search  findings.  Basically  this implies  a block-calving  programme  com­
mencing  at the beginning  of January  and aiming  for completion  by early  
March. No concentrates  are given prior to calving  and all animals  are 
given a uniform  concentrate  input of 7.2 kg per day, irrespective  of yield  
potential  or lactation  number,  from calving  until going  to pasture.  Graz ­
ing commences  during  early to mid-April  at a stocking  rate of 6.4 cows  
per hectare  during  the early season  decreasing  in steps to reach 4.9 cows  
per hectare  by early August  and with about 430 kg N per hectare  being  
applied  over the grazing  season. No concentrates  are given at pasture,  
except  during  the first 7-10 days after turnout,  and from early October  
when all lactating  animals  receive  1.6 ke per day until drying  off. Animals  
are housed  with ad libitum  access  to silage from October  or November.  
The performance  for the herd during  the 12 month  period  ending  Decem ­
ber, 1978, embracing  all experimental  treatments  is given in Table 9.

This performance  indicates  that there is considerable  potential  for achiev ­

inputs  and is the basis for a very sound  dairying  industry.

Rearing  replacement  heifers
While  the management  of the dairy cow during  the productive  period  
of her life has been the major  area of research  work carried  out at Hills ­
borough,  an attempt  has also been made to provide  information  on the 
rearing  of the replacement  stock for the spring-calving  system. At the 
outset it was realised  that, with the relatively  small numbers  of replace ­
ments being reared per year at the Institute,  there was little point in 
becoming  involved  in some of the major  problems  such as age or weight 
at calving.  Instead  the approach  was adopted  that we could achieve  best 
results  by using all available  information  from other centres  throughout  
the world  on these basic questions  and use our resources  to evaluate  how 
the present  target performance  could be best achieved  within a grass  
environment.  The targets  which  have been assumed  are that two year old 
calving  is essential  on economic  grounds  and that, if adequate  lactation  
performance  is to be achieved,  a pre-calving  liveweight  of over 500 kg is 
required.  Furthermore  to achieve  an adequate  conception  rate a live- 
weight  of over 300 kg at mating  is required  and, indeed,  if the pre-calving  
target of 500 kg is to be met it is preferable  that animals  are approxi ­
mately  320 kg at mating.  The problem  in such rearing  systems  has always 
been that of achieving  adequate  growth  during  the early months  of the 
animals  life. A series of experiments  has therefore  been carried  out to 
examine  some of the factors  which might affect performance  during  this 
period.
Effect  of date of turnout  to pasture  during  the first year
In Northern  Ireland  weather  conditions  are generally  unsuitable  to 
allow young  calves  born during  the spring  to go to pasture  before  mid to 
late April. An experiment  was therefore  carried  out to examine  whether  
these animals  should  go to pasture  at this stage or, alternatively,  be re­
tained indoors  for a further  period in an effort to achieve  higher  live- 
weights  before  going  to pasture.  The experiment  was run for two seasons,  
in each season  animals  were put to pasture  either  during  late April,  late 
May or late June. In each case no concentrates  were given throughout  
the grazing  period  which lasted until mid-October.  The groups  retained  
indoors  received  2 kg concentrate  per day in addition  to grass silage. At 
pasture  all calves  grazed  together  as the leader  group  in a leader-follower  
system. The mean results  over the grazing  period  are given in Table 10.

97
During  the extra period when the animals  were maintained  indoors  
they grew considerably  faster  than the group  which  went to pasture  early.  
However,  when these groups  went to pasture  their subsequent  perfor ­
mance  was considerably  poorer  than the group  that had already  been at 
pasture. The result was that by the end of the grazing  season  the group  
put to pasture  early was of similar  liveweight  to the other two groups 
and had consumed  considerably  less concentrates  during the rearing  
period. In addition  the management  at pasture  had been much easier  
than when the animals  were retained  indoors.
From this experiment  it was found that where  animals  were given no 
supplementary  feed during  the pasture  period  a total input  of concentrates  
of approximately  375 kg per animal  was required  in addition  to silage  of 
63 “D” value during  the yearling  winter  to achieve  a mean liveweight  at 
mating  of 320 kg. The question  arose as to whether  providing  some of 
this concentrate  during  the previous  grazing  period would result in a 
better overall  performance.  An experiment  was set up to examine  the 
effect of providing  differing  proportions  of the concentrate  during  the 
grazing  period,  but maintaining  a constant  level of total concentrate  input  
per animal up to mating. Four treatments  were applied  with animals  
getting  0, 15, 36 or 57 per cent of their concentrates  during  the pasture  
period  and the remainder  during  the following  winter. All animals  were 
grazed  as a single,  leader  group  at pasture  and had ad libitum  access  to 
silage of approximately  63 “D” value during  the following  winter. The 
results  are given in Table 11.

Supplementary  concentrates  at pasture  resulted  in a slight improvement  
in liveweight  gain at pasture,  but the response  was small. By the end of 
the following  winter the group which had received  all its concentrates  
indoors  was heavier  than any of the other three groups,  indicating  that 
when adequate  high quality  pasture  is available  concentrate  supplemen ­
tation  should  be limited  to the indoor,  winter-feeding  period.
Type of concentrate  given  indoors
A further  trial has been completed  to assess  the effect of protein  con­
tent of the supplement  given in addition  to silage during  the yearling  
winter. Two supplements  consisting  of either a barley/mineral  mixture,  
containing  9 per cent crude protein,  and a barley/soyabean  mixture,  con-

in equal  amounts  of 2.1 kg per day. The effects  on silage  intake  and final 
liveweight  at the end of the winter  are shown  in Table 12.
Type of supplement  did not affect either silage dry matter  intake  or the 
liveweight  of the animals  at the end of the winter  period,  indicating  that

the cheaper  supplement  consisting  of barley  and minerals  is adequate  as 
a supplement  for silage  during  the yearling  winter.
Length  of dry period  at end of first lactation
With spring-calving  animals  in their first lactation  there is a tendency  
for body condition  to decline  considerably  during  the pasture  period,  with 
the result that the condition  of these animals  at the end of lactation  
is generally  below that of the mature  cow managed  in the same system.  
The question  arises  as to whether  this relatively  poor body condition  will 
affect subsequent  performance  and, if it does, how can it be improved.  
One approach  is to increase  the length  of the dry period  by terminating  
the first lactation  at an earlier  date. An experiment  is in progress  at the 
Institute  to examine  the effect of drying  animals  off four weeks earlier  
than normal. The preliminary  results  from this are given in Table 13.

Drying  the animals  off four weeks  earlier  than normal  increased  the fol­
lowing lactation  yield by 261 kg. However  an approximately  similar  
quantity  of milk was lost from this group  during  the first lactation,  due to 
the early drying-off,  with the effect that total production  assessed  over the 
first two lactations  was unaffected.  However  this study will continue  and 
will be extended  into subsequent  lactations  to establish  whether  there is 
any further  residual  effect.
2. Silage  Quality  
Interval  between  regrowths
The optimum  re-growth  interval  for grass for silage  has been the sub­
ject of considerable  debate  and the purpose  of some of our work has 
been to establish  the effect of different  re-growth  intervals  on milk pro­
duction.  To date two experiments  have been completed.  In the first 
experiment  re-growth  intervals  of 5 and 9 weeks  were compared  using a 
predominantly  perennial  ryegrass  sward (21). The resulting  silages  were  
offered  ad libitum  to lactating  cows with the same quantity  of concentrate  
being given with each silage. The effect of these treatments  on intake  of 
silage dry matter,  milk yield and liveweight  at the end of the experiment  
are given under  Experiment  I in Table 14.

Reducing  the regrowth  interval  from 9 to 5 weeks  resulted  in an 11 per 
cent increase  in silage  dry matter  intake  and 2.5 kg per day in milk yield.  
In the second  experiment  three silages  made after regrowth  intervals  of 
5, 7 and 9 weeks  were assessed  by again  offering  the silages  to dairy cows  
receiving  7.2 kg concentrates  per day (21). The results  are given under  
Expediment  2 in Table 14. The effect on intake  in this trial was greater  
than in the previous  one with a 33 per cent increase  in silage  dry matter  
intake being obtained  by decreasing  the regrowth  interval  from 9 to 5 
weeks. The effect on milk yield however  was similar  to that obtained  in 
Experiment  1.
102
Effect  of wilting  prior  to ensiling
A total of three experiments  have been carried  out to examine  the 
effect of wilting  prior to ensiling  on the milk producing  potential  of the 
resulting  silage (21). In all experiments  the unwilted  herbage  was ensiled  
within 15 minutes  of being mown by rotary mower  and all silages  were 
made with a precision-chop  harvester.  All silages had formic acid 
(Add-F,  B.P. Chemicals  Ltd.) applied  at the rate of approximately  2.2 
litres per tonne  of herbage  ensiled.  The length  of time required  to achieve 
the required  degree of wilt varied between  1 and 5 days in the three  
experiments.  Within  each experiment  cows on both treatments  received 
the same level of concentrate  supplementation  on a fixed daily basis.
The results  of the three experiments  are given in Table 15.

In Experiment  1 wilting  to 35 per cent dry matter  slightly,  but not sig­
nificantly,  improved  the intake  of silage dry matter  but had no effect on 
milk yield. In the second  experiment  wilting  to 47 per cent dry matter  
increased  silage intake by 11 per cent, but significantly  depressed  milk 
output. In Experiment  3 wilting  to 39 per cent dry matter  resulted  in an 
increase  in silage intake  of 10 per cent, but had no effect on milk yield.  
Over the three experiments  wilting  increased  intake  on average  by 8 per 
cent and reduced  milk yield by 2.5 per cent or 0.6 kg per day.
While  such results  do not give much encouragement  for wilting  there  
are however  two factors  which should be remembered.  Firstly fairly  
heavily  wilted silages  were used in all three experiments  and it is still 
open to question  as to whether  a response  might not be obtained  with 
more moderate  degrees  of wilting,  for example  to 25 - 28 per cent dry
103
matter. An experiment  is in progress  at present  to provide  data on this 
point. Secondly,  even if no benefit  is obtained  in terms of animal  pro­
duction  from wilting,  this does not in itself imply  that wilting  should  not 
be carried  out. The whole  concept  of wilting  is much  more  complex  than 
the effect on animal  production  and involves  pollution,  mechanisation,  
speed of harvesting,  ease of handling,  these being aspects  which each 
farmer  must take into account  in making  decisions  on the value of wilt­
ing. I also feel, however,  that there are areas within  silage  making  which 
have not to date been sufficiently  researched  to enable  the farmer  to make  
rational  decisions.  These include  the question  of the effects of silage ­
making  machinery  and harvesting  techniques  on the losses incurred  in 
silage  making  and subsequent  production  of the sward.
Protein  nutrition  on indoor diets
Over the past 20 - 30 years a considerable  volume  of research  work 
has been carried  out on the effect of level of protein  intake  on milk out­
put. In summary  it could be said that little response  has been obtained  
to increasing  protein  intake above that required  to meet theoretical  re­
quirements.  However,  there  are two aspects  which  must be borne  in mind 
before concluding  that all the answers  are known. Firstly,  the bulk of 
the evidence  has been derived  from experiments  in which  different  protein  
levels have been compared  on diets which supplied  theoretical  energy  
requirements  and, secondly,  hay has generally  been the basal diet. With 
regard  to the first point there is now sufficient  evidence  to show that there  
is an interrelationship  between  the response  to providing  additional  pro­
tein and the level of energy  intake (22). For example.  Fig. 1 shows  the 
effect on milk output  of giving  concentrates  of two protein  contents  over 
a range of feeding  levels ranging  from 0.25 - 0.58 kg per kg milk. These  
data were obtained  using cows given two concentrates  containing  either  
12 or 18 per cent protein  in addition  to a basal diet of hay which  supplied  
maintenance  energy  and protein  requirements.  The important  aspect  of 
these results was that at low rates of concentrate  supplementation  no 
benefit  was obtained  from using a concentrate  containing  more than 12 
per cent protein even though this theoretically  represented  a severe  
deficiency  in protein. However,  as the amount  of concentrates  was in­
creased  the increase  in milk yield obtained  from using  the higher  protein  
level became  larger and was greatest  at the highest  level of concentrate  
input. The results also show another  important  point which is that a 
given level of milk yield could be supported  by giving  two protein  con­
centrates  at different  rates. For example,  the 18 per cent protein  concen ­
trate given at the rate of 0.4 kg per kg milk supported  a yield of 16.9 kg 
per day which,  in turn, could alternatively  have been supported  by giving  
the 12 per cent protein  concentrate  at the rate of 0.48 kg per kg milk.  
This demonstrates  that there may be a degree of substitution  between 
protein  content  and feeding  level in the practical  situation,  which can 
become  very important  as the relative  prices  of protein  sources  and cereal 
grain change.
The work involving  intake discussed  above was carried  out with a 
basal diet of hay. However,  the majority  of cows on progressive  farms
104

within  the U.K. and Ireland  are given diets based on silage. In view of 
the fact that the crude protein  content  of silage is relatively  high, nutri ­
tionists  would argue that a low protein  supplement  would provide  for 
theoretical  protein  requirements.  There  is, however,  a growing  volume  of 
evidence  to question  this concept. For example.  Table 16 shows the 
results  from an experiment  in which  cows were given similar  amounts  of 
four concentrates,  but with the concentrates  varying  in protein  content  
from 10 to 21 per cent (23). All four concentrates  were given in addition  
to a basal diet of wilted  grass silage  with a “D” value  of 67.
While in theory  adequate  protein  was supplied  by the concentrate  con­
taining  13.7 per cent protein,  there was a considerable  increase  in milk 
output  up to 21 per cent protein  in the supplement.  A further  experiment  
was therefore  carried  out to examine  a wider range of protein  intakes  in
105

order  to establish  at what level of protein  in the concentrate  the maximum  
milk yield was obtained.  In this trial concentrates  with six protein  con­
tents ranging  from 10 to 29 per cent on a fresh basis were used (24). The 
effects  on milk output  are shown  in Fig. 2 and the relationship  between

milk yield and the percentage  protein  in the concentrate  can be described  
by the following  relationship :
Y = 8.95 + 1.0 X - 0.0205X'
where  Y = milk yield in kg/day  and X = percentage  protein  in the sup­
plement  on a fresh weight  basis. *
Using this relationship  it has been calculated  that for this particular  
silage maximum  milk yield is achieved  by giving  a concentrate  contain ­
ing 24.4 per cent protein  on a fresh basis. However,  economic  return  
is maximised  at the point where the cost of an additional  unit of 
protein  is offset by the returns  in terms of the additional  milk produced.  
At present  Northern  Ireland  prices,  a percentage  unit increase  in protein  
content  increases  the cost of the ration  by about  £1.20 per tonne. With  
milk at 1 Ip per litre an increase  of approximately  0.09 kg milk per day is 
required  to cover this cost and profit is therefore  maximised  at 22 per 
cent protein  content  in the concentrate.  £ven if the cost of increasing  
protein  content  were to double  relative  to the value of milk, profitability  
would still be maximised  with a concentrate  containing  around  20 per 
cent crude  protein.
There is, however,  one point with regard  to the response  to protein  
which as yet has been unexplained.  This refers to the fact that while 
the two previous  experiments  have shown  large responses  to protein,  a 
further  trial at Hillsborough  did not demonstrate  this effect. If the infor ­
mation  coming  from other centres  is also examined  it also appears  that 
there has been a response  in some cases but not in others. The question  
arises as to why this difference  is obtained —is it due to the animals  used 
in these trials or the silages  which  they have been given?
In an attempt  to answer  this point a changeover  trial has been carried  
out to determine  whether  the response  to increased  protein  is affected  by 
wilting  prior to ensiling.  In this trial a high digestibility  grass  was ensiled  
either directly  or after wilting  to 39 per cent dry matter. Each of these  
silages  was given with supplements  containing  13 or 21 per cent crude  
protein  on a fresh basis. The preliminary  results  from this trial are given 
in Table 17.

These results  showed  little response  to increased  protein  when the un­
wilted  material  was used yet, when the same material  was wilted,  a con­
siderable  and statistically  significant  increase  in yield was obtained  when  
the protein  content  of the supplement  was increased.  The response  of 
2.2 kg milk obtained  with the wilted material  is directly  in line with the 
response  obtained  in our earlier  trials.
Conclusion
In conclusion  let us now turn our thoughts  to some of the areas in 
which  further  research  is needed.  In this I do not want to produce  a cata­
logue of areas requiring  further  research,  but rather to concentrate  on 
what I consider  to be the major  areas within  the three topics  that I have 
discussed.
Firstly  the major  problem  confronting  us in the spring-calving  system 
is the conflict  between  maintaining  a high output  per animal,  in this case 
a high milk yield,  while ensuring  that our stocking  rates are high enough 
to efficiently  use the grass which  we grow. It has been seen that 250 - 500 
litres of milk per cow may be lost at high stocking  rates, a loss which  
cannot  be tolerated,  and an effect  which  will become  more  serious  as yield  
per cow increases.  It is likely, therefore,  that this will be an increasing  
problem  in the dairy industry  and I consider  that within the next few 
years this will be a major  factor affecting  the attitude  of the farmer. It 
is important,  therefore,  that research  workers  should  consider  ways of 
maximising  the use of grass without  severely  depressing  yield per animal.  
Unless  a solution  to this problem  is found farmers  will relax stocking  
rates and possibly  use supplementary  feeds in the quest for high milk 
yields  per cow. Both these  approaches  would  be detrimental  to the long­
term good of the industry.
Secondly,  with regards  to silage production  we are now at the stage  
where  the effects  of different  types of silages  on animal  performance  have 
been quantified.  However,  we seem to have completely  forgotten  that 
machinery  is required  to produce  silage  and remarkably  little information  
IS available  on the interaction  between  the machine  and the grass sward. 
For example,  what effect has machinery,  including  both type and weight  
of equipment,  on the quality  of the silage,  the losses  during  ensilage,  and 
subsequent  production  from the sward? It is now time that the best type 
of equipment  for silage making  has been identified  by research  workers  
and these requirements  met by the engineer,  rather  than indiscriminately  
using the equipment  produced  by manufacturers  which very often were 
designed  for conditions  completely  different  to those under which we 
operate.
Finally  our understanding  of silage supplementation  is still confused 
with, for example,  there being large and unexplained  differences  in the 
response  to supplementary  protein  between  silages. We must identify 
why this is so in order  that we can provide  a more correctly  balanced  sup­
plement,  both in terms  of energy  and protein,  for differing  types  of silages.  
We shall not be efficiently  using the feed available  until this can be 
achieved.

A COMPARISON  OF RED CLOVER  AND GRASS  SILAGES  FOR  
BEEF  PRODUCTION
R. W. J. STEEN
Agricultural  Research  Institute  uf N. Ireland,  Hillsborough,  Co. Down.
Two experiments  have been conducted  to compare  red clover and 
grass silages  for beef production  and to examine  the effects  of digestibility  
of red clover silage and the level of concentrate  supplementation  on 
animal  performance.  In the first experiment  red clover silages  of high 
and low digestibility  (700 and 600 g kg~' respectively)  were produced  by 
cutting  red clover  (van Hungaropoly)  at early and late stages  of maturity  
These silages and a grass silage (DMD 710 g kg-') which had been 
harvested  from a perennial  ryegrass  sward after a growth  interval  of 7 
weeks  were offered  ad libitum  to 48 British Friesian  steers (initial live- 
weight  229 kg) for a period  of 11 weeks.  The silages  were unsupplemented.  
Sdage  dry matter  intake  (kg day ') and animal  liveweight  gain (kg day-')  
for the three silages  were 7.75, 0.89, 6.91, 0.69, 5.59, 0.59 for the high 
digestibility  red clover, low digestibility  red clover and grass silages  
respectively.
In the second  experiment  red clover silage (DMD  625 g kg”') and 
grass  silage  (DMD  755 g kg"')  which  had been harvested  from a pierennial  
ryegrass  sward after a growth  interval  of 9 weeks were offered  unsup ­
plemented  or supplemented  with 2 kg of fortified  barley  per head per day 
to 48 British  Friesian  steers (initial  liveweight  332 kg) for a period  of 19 
weeks. Silage  dry matter  intake,  animal  liveweight  gain and carcase  gain 
data for this trial were presented.

INITIAL  RESULTS  OF A DAIRY  HERD  SURVEY  IN 
NORTHERN  IRELAND
W. J. McCAUGHEY,  C. H. McMURRAY  and E. A. GOODALL  
Veterinary  Research  Laboratories.  Storniont,  Belfast.
A stratified  random  sample  of 600 herds (230 cows per herd) was 
investigated  by interview.  Returns  were received  from 515 herds rep­
resenting  17% of all dairy cows. These returns  are being examined  for 
interactions  between  fertility  and those factors  which  have been consid- 
ered to influence  the results  achieved.
There was a significant  difference  between  the calving pattern of 
heifers  (concentrated  in October-November)  and cows (distributed  uni­
formly  from October  to March). This difference  may be the result of 
cumulative  time lost annually  through  reduced  fertility.
There was widespread  use of three breeding  policies,  i.e. Bull only,  
A.I. only and A.I. plus bull. Almost  equal numbers  of cows are mated  
by A.I. and by Bull. The overall  non-return  rate was 71%. Herds  using 
bulls for all breeding  had the highest  non return  rate; those  with A.I. had 
the lowest  and the dual policy  gave an intermediate  value. These  records  
resulted  in tighter  calving  patterns  in the herds  using bulls.
Only 40% of herds achieved  a target  of 10 cwt. heifers  calving  at 24 
months. Repeat  breeding  was a problem  associated  with underweight  
heifers  (< 950 lbs) at calving. Difficult  calving  and retained  placentae  
were frequently  reported  as problems  but resulted  in very few sales.  
Repeat  breeding  in cows was a more serious  problem  in the summer  
than in the winter  and frequently  the affected  cow was sold.
Fertility  was lower on farms  using over 300 units nitrogen  per acre on 
silage  grass. The data do not show that this was a direct  effect.
Emphasis  on heat detection  was highly variable  and was correlated  
with the breeding  policy adopted.  There appears  to be considerable  
scope for improvement  in this area.
The data collected  indicates  that a more detailed  study into the 
individual  animal ’s fertility  is necessary  before  detailed  interactions  can 
be determined.

A COMPARISON  OF CONSTANT  RATE  AND VARIABLE  
CONCENTRATE  FEEDING  FOR DAIRY  COWS
P. A. GLEESON
Agricultural Institute,  Moorepark,  Fernioy,  Co. Cork.
Thirty Friesian  spring calving  dairy cows were allocated  to two 
experimental  treatments  :
(1) fed silage ad libitum  with 7.27 kg (109 kg for the group)  of a 16 
percent  crude protein  dairy ration  per head per day;
(2) fed silage ad libitum  and a total concentrate  allowance  to the group  
of 109 kg per day but allocated  to cows in relation  to milk yield.
Cows  were assigned  to treatment,  after a minimum  period  of three weeks  
post calving,  based on the milk yield of the last week of the preliminary  
period.
The mean  milk yields  for this final week were 22 kg (range 16.3-27.1  
for treatment  1 and 22.2 (range 16.4-27.6)  for 2. The mean lactation  
number  was 6.4 and 6.1 for treatments  1 and 2 respectively.  Concentrate  
feeding  levels for treatment  2 were adjusted  at weeks  2, 4 and 6 based 
on milk yields  of the two previous  weeks. The experimental  period  lasted 
8 weeks. Cows  were individually  housed  and offered  silage at 10 percent  
in excess  of daily intake,  all refusals  being recorded  daily. The daily  
concentrate  allowance  was fed in two equal feeds. Milk yields were  
recorded  5 days per week,  milk fat and protein  determined  once weekly  
and liveweight  were recorded  once weekly.
There  were no significant  differences  between  treatments  in milk yield, 
milk fat or protein  percentage.  Silage  intakes  were lower  on the variable  
concentrate  group and cows lost more liveweight.  Those  cows in treat ­
ment 2 receiving  the greatest  amount  of concentrates  had a much lower 
intake  (1.3% l.wt) than the cows on the lower concentrate  levels (1.6%  
l.wt). The results  indicate,  in the absence  of competition,  that variable  
rate feeding  has no advantage  over constant  rate feeding  for cows at the 
same stage of lactation.
EMBRYO  MORTALITY  IN THE COW  
M. G. DISKIN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
Reproductive  failure is one of the major factors  affecting  output  in 
either  the beef or dairy  cow herds. Although  it is generally  accepted  that 
fertilization  rates following  either natural  or artificial  insemination  are 
normally  close to 90%, calving  rates to a single insemination  are closer  
to 50%. While  most reports  demonstrate  the existence  and extent  of this 
embryonic  loss few of them indicate  the timing  at which  it occurs.
Studies  were carried  out to determine  the fertilization  and embryo  
survival  rates at various  stages  after insemination.
Fertilization  rate was estimated  at 90% following  the use of frozen- 
thawed  semen. However  the embryo  survival  rate at Day 42 was 52%.  
The extent  and timing  of this embryonic  loss was discussed.  Advances  in 
this area could contribute  significantly  to an increased  reproductive  rate.

INCREASING  THE CALVING  AND TWINNING  RATE  IN THE
BEEF  HERD
J. M. SREENAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam.  Co. Galway.
The recent  decline  in beef numbers  will have serious  repercussions  on 
beef output  over the next few years.  Expansion  in the dairy  herd sufficient  
to offset this reduction  is unlikely,  due to levelling  off of milk prices.  
Increasing  the number  of calves  born is now an urgent  necessity  for the 
beef industry.  Management  can play a major  role in determining  repro ­
ductive  rate and intensive  management  will shorten  the post partum  
interval  and increase  the conception  rate.
Over the past few years part of the research  programme  in cow 
fertility  at Belciare  has been devoted  to the induction  of twinning  as one 
possible  means of increasing  the national  calf crop with particular  re­
ferences  to single  suckler  herds.
Two aspects  of twinning  are being  examined  :
1. Twinning  by PMSG  (mild superovulation)
The production  of a low level of twinning  by administration  of PMSG  
at low doses 500-800  i.u. in conjunction  with heat synchronization.  
This has given a twinning  rate of 10% and a 15% increase  in the 
conception  rate.
2. Twinning  by embryo  transfer
This involves  the collection  of embryos  from donor cows and their  
transfer  non-surgically  to the contralateral  uterine horn of bred 
recipients.  Pregnancy  rates of 60% and a twinning  rate of 60% of 
pregnant  animals  were obtained.

THE EFFECT  OF MONENSIN  ON THE PERFORMANCE  OF
STORE  LAMBS
A. KINSELLA  and J. L. L’ESTRANGE  
Department  of Agriculture  Chemistry,  U.C.D.,  GUisnevin,  Dublin  9.
Monensin  (Rumensin),  used as a feed additive,  has been found to 
improve  the feed conversion  ratio (FCR) of beef animals  on a wide  
range of diets. This effect is thought  to be due to an alteration  of 
fermentation  in rumen fluid resulting  in increased  propionic  acid and 
decreased  acetic acid production.  In the experiments  reported  here, the 
effects  of Monensin  on the performance  of store lambs fattened  indoors  
were studied.
In experiment  1, forty-eight  Cheviot  ram lambs were fed a whole 
barley-based  concentrate  diet containing  0, 15, or 30 ppm Monensin,  fed 
ad libitum  with or without  a supplement  of long hay. Monensin  at both 
levels improved  live-weight  gain and FCR but not significantly  so. It 
significantly  increased  the proportion  of propionic  acid in the rumen  
fluid of the lambs,  while it decreased  the proportions  of acetic  and butyric  
acids. The response  to Monensin  was significantly  greater  when hay was 
supplemented.
In Experiment  2, which was a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial  design,  forty-eight  
Cheviot  ram lambs were fed a whole barley or a molassed  beet pulp- 
based concentrate  diet, containing  0 or 30 ppm Monensin  fed ad libitum,  
with or without  a supplement  of long hay. Feed intake,  live-weight  gain 
and FCR were significantly  better on the beet pulp than on the barley  
treatments.  However,  Monensin  did not improve  the performance  of the 
lambs  and had little effect  on rumen  fermentation.  There  was little effect  
also caused  by hay supplementation.

GRAZING  BEHAVIOUR  OF SHEEP  AND CATTLE  IN 
MIXED  GRAZING
T. NOLAN,  J. CONNOLLY  and M. dc RANCOURT  
Agricultural  Institute,  Creagh,  Ballinrohe,  Co. Mayo.
A three year experiment  showed  that mixed grazing  increased  in­
dividual  weaned  lamb and 1^-year  old steer liveweight  gains by 10 to 
30%. The benefit  to either  species  increased  as the proportion  in the mix 
decreased.  This experiment  attempted  to explain  the role of complemen ­
tary grazing  with particular  reference  to sheep grazing  ‘fouled ’ herbage  
(High  Grass)  around  the cattle  dung  pat areas  which  cattle refuse.
The results  show that on an area basis both cattle and sheep had 
marked  preferences  for High as opposed  to Low Grass in terms  of time 
spent grazing. The sheep preference  was generally  twice that of the 
cattle. On a DM basis cattle grazed High Grass in proportion  to the 
amount  of High Grass  DM present  and sheep  preference  continued  to be 
about  twice that of cattle.
Comparisons  at the beginning  and end of grazing  a paddock  showed  
that both cattle and sheep preferences  for High Grass increased  sig­
nificantly  with time on both an area and DM bases. The increase  was 
far greater  for area (about 206%)  than for DM (about 68%). Sheep 
preference  was twice that for cattle at the start and finish of grazing  and 
for an area and DM bases.
Results  for four time periods  showed  that on an DM basis cattle  
preference  for High Grass was significant  for the first period only and 
was less marked  as the grazing  season  advanced.  On an area basis  cattle  
had a marked  preference  for High Grass during all periods. Sheep 
preference  for High Grass  was significant  during  the first and last periods  
and exceeded  cattle preference  by a factor of about two on an area or 
DM basis.

EFFECTS  OF EWE PROLIFICACY  ON SHEEP  INCOME
S. FLANAGAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
The effects of crossing  Galway  sheep with very prolific  breeds on 
litter size have been reported  previously.  However,  there was a lack of 
recorded  information  on the financial  consequences  arising  from the use 
of new sheep breeds. Consequently,  at Blindwell  ewe performance  and 
income  were compared  in two breeds  of lowland  sheep which differ 
widely  in prolificacy.  The two breeds,  Galway  and Improved  Galway,  
were managed  under commercial  farm conditions  and under the one 
system  of husbandry.
Over the two years 1977 and 1978 the Improved  Galway  breed pro­
duced on average  0.3 more lambs per ewe lambing  compared  with the 
Galway.  The superiority  of the Improved  Galway  for lamb sales (£) per 
100 ewes to the ram amounted  to 30% on average  over the two years. 
Gross  margin  per ewe was improved  by over 45% when Improved  Gal­
way ewes were used instead  of Galway  ewes.
It is concluded  that large cash benefits  are feasible  when sheep 
breeding  research  results  are translated  into farm practice.

BREED  DIFFERENCES  IN THE RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  
EWE BODYWEIGHT  AND PRODUCTIVITY
J. P. HANRAHAN
Agricultural  Institute,  Belciare,  Tuam,  Co, Galway.
It is well known that there is a positive  relationship  between  ewe 
liveweight  and fecundity  (litter size). Since most studies  on this topic  
have used ewes of low to moderate  fecundity  and future interest  will be 
in more prolific  breeds  it will be important  to know whether  bodyweight  
is more critical  with very prolific  ewes. Also, if breed differences  exist  
in the bodyweight/fecundity  relationship  this would  imply  different  cost/  
benefit  functions.  The data reported  relate  to analyses  of ewe bodyweight  
/ litter size relationships  in Galway,  J Finn, Fingalway  and High Fertility  
flocks  which are part of the sheep breeding  research  flocks  of The Agri ­
cultural  Institute.  In addition,  factors affecting  ewe bodyweight  have 
been examined  in 15 pedigree  Galway  flocks  over two years. The within  
flock relationships  between  ewe bodyweight  and litter size and lamb  
growth  rate pre-weaning  have also been examined.  Bodyweight  in all 
cases refers  to weight  at the time of mating  (October).
The major  difference  between  the genetic  groups  studied  is in fecun ­
dity. The average  litter sizes (1972-1978)  were 1.4, 1.7, 2.0 and 2.0 for 
Galway,  i Finn,  Fingalway  and High Fertility,  respectively.  The relation ­
ship between  bodyweight  and litter size was examined  graphically  for 
each breed group  and 2-tooth  ewes were treated  separately.  For mature  
ewes the results  show a pronounced  breed difference  with essentially  no 
relationship  in the Fingalway  and High Fertility groups  and a pronounced  
positive  relationship  in the Galway  and Finn groups. In the case of 
2-tooth  ewes all breeds  showed  a positive  relationship  at low weights  but 
there was an apparent  plateau at higher weights  for the two high 
fecundity  breed groups.
The pattern  of relationships  seen for litter size were also evident  for 
ovulation  rate but the volume  of data was much smaller.
For pedigree  Galway  ewes the within-flock  regression  of litter size 
on bodyweight  (kg) was 0.012  + 0.003 in the 1974/75  data set and 0.011  + 
0.()04 in the 1975/76  data set. The relationship  between  lamb average  
daily gain and ewe bodyweight  was not significant  for the 1974/75  data 
set (0.0001+0.0004)  but was highly significant  in the second data set 
(0.()012±0.0003).  Flock  differences  accounted  for approximately  50% of 
variation  in age-adjusted  bodyweight.  Single-born  ewes were heavier  
than multiple  born ewes at all ages; the average  difference  was 2.8 kg. 
Ewe bodyweight  was also influenced  by litter size in the previous  spring  
—ewes which  produced  singles  were heavier  at weighing  in October  than 
ewes which produced  multiples.  This effect however  depended  on ewe 
age and flock.
Breed differences  in the ewe bodyweight/litter  size relationship  sug­
gest that bodyweight  at mating  is less critical  in highly  prolific  ewes with 
consequent  savings  on inputs  at this time which  may yield a higher  return  
at around  lambing  time.
CONTRIBUTIONS  TO IMPROVED  SOW PRODUCTION
N. WALKER
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of N. Ireland.  Hillsborough.  Co. Down.
Rearing  more bonhams  per sow per year invariably  increases  profits. 
Production  can commence  earlier  by mating  gilts at puberty  rather  than 
at a later oestrus  and is likely  to produce  more pigs per unit time. Puberty  
can be advanced  slightly  with various  stimuli  but does not appear  to be 
retarded  by rearing  gilts with contemporary  boars.
The frequency  with which  mature  boars  are used for mating  has some  
effect on litter size.
Re-establishing  pregnancy  in the weaned  sow, especially  after the 
first parity,  is an aspect  of management  where improvements  are often  
possible.  The social stimulus  of group-housing  newly-weaned  sows was 
not beneficial  under  our conditions.  However,  exogenous  hormone  given  
on the day of weaning  to primiparous  sows reduced  the mean time to 
conception  and increased  subsequent  litter size. Confirmation  of preg­
nancy  has been tested  with a commercial  ultrasonic  device  which,  together  
with vaginal  biopsy  data,  suggests  that the incidence  of pregnancies  which 
are terminated  around  mid-gestation  may warrant  further  consideration.
A comparison  of weaning  ages of 10, 25 or 40 days showed  that 
maximum  sow production  on a herd basis was achieved  with 10 day 
weaning.
It has been suggested  that lactating  sows have a latent heat three  
weeks  post partum  and that early-weaning  prior to this will result in a 
shorter  time to conception.  Our evidence  does not support  this thesis.  
Regardless  of weaning  age the productivity  of a sow herd is dominated  
by first and second  parity animals  and in particular  by the size of their  
litters.
The number  of pigs born per litter should  be increased  by all possible 
means  since it is now becoming  possible  to identify  the rearing  capabil ­
ities of the sow and to rear ‘surplus ’ piglets  artificially.

EFFECTS  OF PHYSICAL  FORM  OF DIET  AND  DIETARY  LEVEL  
OF SKIM  MILK  POWDER  ON PERFORMANCE  OF PIGS  
WEANED  AT 2-3 WEEKS  OF AGE
D. C. PATTERSON
Af^riciiltitral  Research  Institute  of N. Ireland,  HiUshorouf ’h, Co. Down.
A total of 180 pigs weaned  within 13-19 days of age, of 4.7 kg mean  
initial liveweight  and penned  in groups  of 6 were assigned  to a 3 x 2 
factorial  experiment  in which three physical  forms of starter  diet were 
each followed  by two physical  forms of grower  diet. The forms of 
starter  diet were pellets  (4.75 mm diam.),  ground  meal and flaky meal.  
The flaky form was created  by omitting  to grind the flaked  maize which 
was present  in the starter  diets at a level of 200 g/kg. The forms of 
grower  diet were pellets  (4.75 mm diam.)  and ground  meal. The change  
from starter to grower  occurred  at 12.5 kg liveweight  with both diets  
given  ad libitum.  Meal diets gave a higher  liveweight  gain from weaning  
to 12.5 kg liveweight  but the difference  between  the meal and pellet  forms  
was small during  the 12.5 to 25 kg liveweight  stage. Pelleted  diets gave 
superior  conversion  ratios during  both stages. The flaky meal form of 
the starter  diet gave a slightly  slower  growth  rate than the ground  meal 
form from weaning  to 12.5 kg liveweight.
In a 4 X 3 X 2 factorial  experiment  four levels of skim milk powder  
in the starter  diet were combined  with three times  of changeover  to the 
grower  diet and two levels  of skim milk powder  in the grower  diet. The 
levels of skim milk powder  in the starter  diets were 0, 100, 200 and 300 
g/kg,  the changeover  times  were 7, 14 and 21 days post-weaning  and the 
levels  of skim milk powder  in the grower  diet were 0 and 100 g/kg. All 
diets were offered  ad libitum.  Ninety-six  pigs weaned  at 19-22 days of 
age were allocated  to the experiment.  The greater  the skim milk content  
of the starter  diet the higher  the rate of liveweight  gain and the lower  the 
feed conversion  ratio. With each incremental  change  of 100 g skim milk 
powder  per kg starter  diet daily liveweight  gain increased  by about 17 
g/day  and feed conversion  ratio improved  by 0.03 units. The pigs grew  
faster when skim milk was included  in the grower  diet but there was no 
consistent  response  to variations  in the time when the starter  diet was 
replaced  with the grower  diet.

FACTORS  AFFECTING  THE EFFICIENCY  OF FEED  
UTILIZATION  IN PIGS

This experiment  was designed  to assess  the effect  of diet form on feed 
utilization  efficiency.  The Moorepark  standard  diet fed in meal form 
(control),  pelleted,  or with 2% added fat were compared.  Digestibility  
studies indicated  that the meal, pelleted,  and 2% fat diets contained  
3.035, 3.007 and 3.085 Meal D.E./kg  respectively.  The slightly  lower 
digestible  energy  content  of the pellets  corresponded  with their lower  dry 
inatter  and suggests  that pelleting  does not improve  the digestibility  of 
diets. The feeding  trial involved  576 pigs penned  in groups  of 16 and 
housed  in a conventional  type building  which was naturally  wentilated,  
with temperature  maintained  around  2 PC. All pens had a 1.83 meter  
feed hopper  and an ad libitum  supply  of water. Sufficient  feed to last a 
six hour feeding  period  was allocated  each morning.  Pigs fed the pelleted  
and fat supplemented  diets had feed utilization  efficiencies  5% and 2% 
respectively  better than the meal fed pigs. The improved  efficiency  on 
the fat supplemented  diet is no more than expected  from the digestibility  
data whereas  the pelleted  diet performed  above expectation.  This sug­
gests considerable  wastage  of feed in the case of the meal and fat 
supplemented  diets. Visable  feed wastage  was not observed.
