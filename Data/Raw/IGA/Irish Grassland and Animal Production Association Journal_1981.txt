Fertilising  of High Producing  
Grass Swards

latroduction
This paper  describes  the use of major  nutrients  (N, P. K) and secondary  
nutrients  (magnesium  and sulphur)  together  with lime and slurry for 
optimum  grass  production.  The trace elements  especially  those of impor ­
tance to the animal rather than the grass, e.g. molybdenum,  cobalt,  
selenium,  are not within  the scope of this report. The designation  ‘high 
producing  grass swards ’ refers to those capable  of producing  12,500-  
15,000  kg dry matter/ha  and capable  of carrying  3.0 livestock  units per 
hectare  (0.82 ac per livestock  unit). Usually  such swards  will be domin ­
antly ryegrass  with relatively  little clover but some references  will be 
made to old pasture  and the significance  of clover.
Nitrogen
Nitrogen  is the most costly fertiliser  for grassland.  Up to £145 per 
hectare  (£59 per acre) is commonly  spent on this single element  in Hol­
land. It is therefore  the element  which  has been most studied  but is also 
the one on which  there is least agreement  regarding  its optimum  use.
There are at least four factors  which affect the response  of grass to 
nitrogen  fertiliser  and the amount  of nitrogen  needed.
1) Number  of cuts.
2) Age  of the sward.
3) Climate.
4) Soil type.
Nitrogen  — Cutting
Much  of the published  literature  on the responses  of grass to nitrogen  
refers  to experiments  where  the grass  was cut 5-8 times  per annum.  This 
is very different  from farm practice  on conservation  in Ireland  which  
usually  includes  1, 2 or possibly  3 cuts. Morrisson  (1) working  in the UK 
compared  four cuts with six cuts on a number  of sites and found that 
390 kg N/ha  was optimum  with six cuts but only 280 kg N/ha  with four 
cuts. High nitrogen  requirements  measured  in Northern  Ireland  have 
been contrasted  with lower amounts  reported  from experiments  in the 
Republic  of Ireland  (2). It is likely  that the number of cuts taken  was the 
main reason  for the difference  which  is illustrated  in Figure  1.
DM kg/ha
Fig 1 : A comparison  between  responses  to nitrogen  measured  at Hillsborough  using  
8 cuts and Johnstown  Castle  using 4 cuts.
The two swards  used in the experiments at Hillsborough  and Johnstown  
Castle  were very comparable  in that both produced  approximately  7,000  
kg DM/ha  with no nitrogen  and both reached  a maximum  yield of 
approximately  15,000  kg DM/ha.  But the sward at Hillsborough,  which 
was cut eight times,  required  600 kg N/ha  to reach the optimum  yield  
while that at Johnstown  Castle,  which was cut four times,  needed  only 
200 kg N/ha  to reach the same yield. We need to distinguish  therefore  
between  high requirement  for nitrogen  fertiliser  and high yields  or high 
responses  in yield to nitrogen.  In general  yields  in Ireland  are as high as 
those in the UK or on the Continent.
There is little experimental  evidence  for the effect of age of sward on 
nitrogen  requirement  but there is considerable  experience  that a pasture  
needs approximately  50 kg N/ha extra for the first two years after  
establishment.
The effects  of climate  on nitrogen  requirement  are difficult  to quantify  
but a series  of experiments reported  by Ryan  (3) showed  higher  yields  and 
higher nitrogen  requirement  along the south coast. This is probably  
related  to the longer  growing  season  in that region. The effect probably  
does not extend  more than 15 miles from the coast.
In the same series  Ryan also showed  that clay soils were less responsive 
than average.  Some variation  is therefore  to be expected  in the correct  
amount  of nitrogen  to apply but if we consider  the normal  grassland  
systems  in Ireland,  i.e. one or two cuts of silage  with 7 to 8 weeks  interval  
between  fertiliser  application  and harvest  (25 May and 20 July) the vari­
ation is probably  less than +15%.
DM kg/ha

me. Murphy)
Murphy  (4) has studied  the responses  of grassland  to nitrogen  under  
cutting  on a wide range of sites and for a number  of years and recom ­
mended  100 kg N/ha  and 85 kg N/ha  as optimum  for the first and second
cuts of silage  respectively.  Figure  2 shows  the average  response  for 1979.  
A response  of 1550 kg DM/ha  was obtained  to 100 kg N/ha  or 15.5 kg 
DM/kg  N.
If a third cut is required  a further  85 kg N/ha is recommended  or a 
similar  amount  should  be applied  for grazing  the aftermath.  A sward 
which  had been used for two cuts of silage would therefore  receive  2/U 
kg N/ha  in the year in three-four  dressings.
A change  to a management  system  practised  in Holland  where silage  
is cut at much more frequent  intervals  with yields  of 2500 kg DM/ha  
expected  at first cut, compared  to 4500 kg DM/ha  in Ireland  would  
require  higher  rates of nitrogen  over the year. A better  quality  silage is 
claimed  for such a system  so it may be adopted  more widely  in the future.
Nitrogen  — Grazing
The foregoing  section  referred  to the use of nitrogen  for silage. Ex^ri-  
mental  evidence  for the optimum  use of nitrogen  for grazed swards  is 
far less comprehensive.  Many of the early experiments  in the 1960 s 
were carried  out at low stocking  rates which  did not require  ri^rates ot 
nitrogen.  Three modem  experiments  carried out in the 1970 s and 
extending  into the 1980 ’s are the most relevant  to conditions  in the 
RepuWic  of Ireland  today. McFeely  et al. (5) working  at Kilmeadon  in 
1973/75  with dairy cows concluded  that rates of nitrogen  higher  than 
250 kg N/ha  were not justified.  An early report  by McCarthy  (6) of an 
experiment  still in progress  at Moorepark  supports  this conclusion. 
Collins  (7) working  with beef animals  at Grange  concluded  that the 
optimum  amount  of nitrogen  was 120 kg N/ha. In doing this he 
emphasised  the economic  differences  between  dairying  and beet as 
influencing  the profit from nitrogen  fertiliser  but also pointed  out that 
part of the reason  for the poor response  to nitrogen  in his experiments  
was the very high output  of the low nitrogen  treatment  which  was prob ­
ably due to a very vigorous  clover sward. This is a very ini^rtant  
aspect  of the research  on nitrogen  use as the biggest  differences  between 
sites and between  experiments  is to be found between  the low nitrogen  
treatments.  The establishment  of such highly productive  clover swards 
is at the moment  more an art than a science  and may require  3-4 years  
grazing  at intensities  higher  than ideal for production  per animal. Much 
more detailed  work is required  on this topic which might profoundly  
affect  nitrogen  requirements.
Evidence  available  therefore  suggests  that there is no advantage  in 
using  more than 250 kg N/hectare  for grazing  for either  beef or dairying  
and that lower  rates may be optimum  on some high clover  swards. It is 
expected  that with the current  state of knowledge  high productivity  will 
be more reliably  achieved  with the nitrogen  treatment  than with clover. 
The nitrogen  for grazing  should  be split into 5-7 applications.
In summary,  270 kg N/ha is recommended  for two or three cuts of 
silage and up to 250 kg N/ha  for intensively  grazed  swards.
Fonns  of nitrogen
Urea nitrogen  is normally  much cheaper  than ammonium  nitrate  
nitrogen  and is equally  effective  under conditions  of adequate  rainfall.  
However  in dry conditions  losses  may be as high as 50% so in practice  
results from Urea are not reliable  between  about mid May and mid 
August  (8).
Phosphorus
The effects  of phosphorus  are less complicated  than those of nitrogen  
At low soil levels  very large responses  can be obtained,  e.g. 60 kg DM/kg  
P but soil levels  can be built up at relatively  modest  rates of application.  
The strategy  should  be to build up reserves  under grazing  and then main ­
tain this status by replacing  the amounts  removed  in silage or in the 
animal.
Recommendations
Grazing  — Build up deficient  soils 40 kg P/ha
— Maintain  soil status  >4 ppm P 20 kg P/ha  
Silage — 1 cut 35 kg P/ha
2 cuts 18 kg P/ha after 1st cut
27 kg P/ha after 2nd cut
Soils differ in their capacity  to store phosphorus  and a fertile  soil can be 
depleted  within  two or three years if neglected.
Potassium
The policy  for potassium  should  be similar  to phosphorus  except  that 
very large amounts  can be removed  under  cutting  (over 200 kg K/ha in 
two cuts) and the changes  in soil status  are more  dramatie.  The limestone  
soils in the midlands,  Kildare,  Offaly,  Laois are particularly  vulnerable.  
In one experiment  carried  out over four years the yield of grass  fell from  
10,200  to 4,800 kg DM/ha  while soil potassium  fell from 62 ppm to 23 
ppm. In the Republic  of Ireland  this aspect  is being  neglected  and some  
43% of soil samples  analysed  after silage  are deficient  in potassium.  Other  
fertiliser  nutrients  applied  to silage are usually  slightly  above  recommen ­
dations,  so farm practice  seems  to be in error on this point even among  
intensive  farmers.
Recommendations
Grazing  — Build up deficient  soils
— Maintain  status >74 ppm K 
Silage — 1 cut 
— 2 cuts80 kg K/ha
40 kg K/ha
148 kg K/ha
75 kg/ha  after 1st cut

Magnesium
Although  low values of magnesium  in herbage  (0.1%) have been  
recorded  in Ireland  to responses  in herbage  yields  to magnesium  applica ­
tion have been measured.  Over much of the country  more than 20 kg 
Mg/ha  are delivered  every year in rainfall  which apparently  effectively  
maintains  the magnesium  status  of the soil.
Low levels of magnesium  in herbage  are also associated  with grass  
tetany  in cattle and the herbage  status  can be increased  by treating  the 
pasture  with dolomitic  limestone.  Such treatment  however  can only be 
considered  on acid soil near a Source  of dolomitic  limestone.  In Holland  
this is considered  useful insurance  against  tetany but in Ireland  routine  
dusting  of pastures  or direct feeding  with calcined  magnesite  is recom ­
mended.
Lime
The use of lime on pastures  especially  permanent  pastures  has been 
neglected  in the Republic  of Ireland.  This may be because  lime is slow 
acting  compared  to other  fertilisers  and a complete  failure  due to acidity  
in grassland  is virtually  unknown.  Nevertheless  lime can increase  yields 
of grasses  whether  ryegrass  or the poorer  species  associated  with perman ­
ent pastures.  It acts by releasing  nitrogen  from soil organic  matter  or by 
improving  clover  and by making  phosphorus  more available  to the plant.  
Because  of this, high rates of nitrogen  and phosphorus  can largely 
substitute  for the effects  of lime. This point is shown  in Table 1 where 
the response  of a pure ryegrass  sward  to lime at different  rates of  nitrogen  
is listed.
Table 1
Interaction  of lime and nitrogen  on grass yield (kg/ha)

too 8,600 11,300
200 12,700 14,360
300 14,700 14,800
At high rates of nitrogen  the response  to lime was very small compared  
to that at low rates of nitrogen  but the amount  of nitrogen  needed  to 
achieve  a particular  yield was higher  on the unlimed  than the limed  plots.  
Because  lime effects  are long term —probably  10-15 years—  it is cheaper  
to use it than to substitute  nitrogen  for it.
A pH of 6.5 is recommended  for normal  mineral  soils. Maintenance  of 
this status  will require  approximately  5 t/ha (2 t/ac) every 10 years. On 
soils which are high in Molybdenum  as in areas of Meath,  Westmeath,  
Kildare,  Offaly  the pH should  not be increased  above 6.0 as pH’s above  
6.5 will increase  Molybdenum  uptake  which in turn will interfere  with 
copper  metabolism  in the animal.  On acid soils where 15 t/ha (6 t/ac)

is recommended  the dressing  should  be split with an interval  of 4-5 years  
between  applications  on top of the pasture. For establishment  of new 
pastures  where the lime is harrowed  in, the full dressing  should be 
applied  before  sowing.
Sulphur
It has been known  for many years that sulphur  is an essential  element  
for plants and animals  but it was not considered  to be commercially  
important  in Ireland  before 1975. Following  early work with grasses  
and clovers  in pots, Hanley  et al (9) measured  a 16% response  in DM 
yield under field conditions  in Wexford  in 1973. This experiment  was 
carried  out on a Screen  series soil which is a very coarse sand and the 
results  could not be extrapolated  to other  areas  with confidence.  However  
a survey  of 112 silage crops  in 1977 showed  that 25% of these contained  
less than 0.20% sulphur  which is generally  accepted  as a critical  value. 
Field experiments  in 1978 and 1979 carried  out on 81 sites showed  that 
restrictions  of yield of more than 10% due to sulphur  deficiency  were 
widespread  and were most common  on light textured  soils of low organic  
matter. Old pastures  were affected  as well as new pastures.  Deficiencies 
were most common  late in the season  but in 1980, particularly  with very 
low rainfall  in April and May, the problem  also occurred  early in the 
year. At one site at Dunmore,  Kilkenny,  the DM yield increased  from 
9,600  kg/ha  to 13,900  i.e. 45% increase  following  treatment  with gypsum 
(calcium  sulphate).
More  recent  work in 1979 and ’80 has shown  that ammonium  sulphate,  
single superphosphate,  ammonium  sulphate  nitrate,  elemental  sulphur  
and pig and cattle slurry  are all useful  sources  of sulphur.  There is some  
evidence  available  that split dressings  are better than single dressings 
and there is relatively  little residual  value  from one year to another.
Preliminary  evidence  from a feeding  trial currently  in progress  at 
Johnstown  Castle indicates  that sulphur  deficiency  in silage may reduce 
liveweight  gain in cattle as well as yield of herbage.
It is known  that excess  sulphur  can interfere  with copper  metabolism  
in the liver and in this respect  may aggravate  the effects  of high moly ­
bdenum.  This should  not be a difficulty  in practice  since in Ireland  high 
molybdenum  never  occurs  on light textured  soils where  sulphur  would  be 
deficient.  However,  it is a reason  to avoid blanket  treatment  of all soils 
with sulphur.
Overall,  some 1.5 million  acres in the Republic  of Ireland  may be 
affected  by shortage  of sulphur.  The light textured  soils where it occurs  
are found in all areas but are most common  near Carlow,  east Galway,  
Tipperary  and on the gravel  soils in the midlands.  The recommendations  
are :
25 kg S/ha applied in February  plus 25 kg S/ha applied  in June.  
Ammonium  Sulphate  24% S, Ammonium  Sulphate  Nitrate  14% S and 
single superphosphate  12% S are all useful sources  of sulphur.  Fertiliser  
compounds  usually  contain  less than 1-5% sulphur  but 14.7.14  contains
10
8% S. Slurries  contain  variable  amounrti  of sulphur  and should be 
analysed  if they are used as a source.
Slurry  or farm yard manure
Some 80-90%  of N, P, K in animal  feed passes  through  the animal  
to the dung or urine and if it was all stored without  loss and returned  
to the field in which the silage or fodder  crop was grown the need for 
added fertiliser  would be greatly  reduced.  However,  storage,  transport  
and handling  are all expensive  and usually  neglected  so the ideal closed 
cycle is seldom  achieved.  Because  of enormous  variation  in practice  due 
to either losses by leaching  from farm yard manure  or dungsteads  or 
dilution  in slurry tanks only general  guidelines  can be given here. Work  
by Kiely  and Roche  (10) has shown  that most of the nitrogen  will be lost 
if a dry period follows  the spreading  of slurry on top of grassland.  In 
some circumstances  yield may be depressed  due to solids  drying  out on 
the herbage. If the nitrogen  is applied  in autumn  it will be lost by 
leaching.  The best time to apply slurry is in the mid-February  to mid- 
March period,  when some rain can be expected  to wash the slurry into 
the soil without  excessive  losses from leaching  or run-off. The slurry  
should  be returned  to the silage  ground  at 34 cb metre/ha.  This dressing  
will probably  provide  37 kg N/ha and 25 kg P/ha plus 150 kg K/ha.
Summary
The summary  recommendations  for N fertiliser  are as follows  :
Grazing :
Up to 250 kg N/ha split in 5-7 applications  
plus
185 or 370 kg of 0 : 10 : 20 per hectare.
Silage  :
34 cubic metre/ha  of slurry in February/March  
plus
65 kg N/ha at end of March;
85 kg N/ha  plus 250 kg 0 : 7 : 30/ha  after 1st cut, 25th May;
85 kg N/ha  for aftergrass.
If slurry is not used add a further  35 kg N at the end of March  i.e. 
100 kg N/ha altogether  plus 370 kg 0 : 7 : 30 fertiliser  compound  per 
hectare  in autumn  or early spring.
Check  the analysis  of slurry. Check  soil analysis  every five years and 
adjust  rates of lime, phosphorus  and potassium  upwards  or downwards  
to maintain  soil fertility.
Apply 25 kg S/ha in February  and again in June on light textured  
(sandy)  soils.

Developments  in Beef Production  
in the Netherlands
D. OOSTENDORP
Research  and Advisory  Institute  jor Cattle  Husbandry,  Lelystad.
Holland.
Beef production  in the Netherlands  has always  been secondary  to milk 
production  and will remain  so in the future. Contrary  to most of our 
neighbouring  countries  there has never been a development  of a specific  
beef breed or an independent  beef production  system. The few herds  
of foreign  beef breeds  like Charolais  and Limousin  are kept more as a 
hobby than as major sources  of income. Thus, beef production  has 
always  been dependent  on the dairy herd of Dutch Friesian  (DF) and 
Meuse-RHINE-Ijssel  (MRY)  dual purpose  breeds.
Nevertheless  in the past twenty  years major  developments  in beef and 
veal production  have taken  place. Previously,  in the 1950 ’s beef produc ­
tion consisted  of grazing  and fattening  of culled  cows and heifers  and to 
a small extent  grazing  of steers,  whereas  at the same time about  700,000  
newly  bom calves  were slaughtered  yearly. Since then specific  production  
of veal caves  and bull beef has been developed,  which is of great impor ­
tance for the farmers  involved,  the feeding  stuffs industry,  the slaughter ­
houses  and the meat trade. Also,  the dairy farmers  have benefitted  from  
higher  calf prices.
Number  of slaughterings
The trends  in slaughterings  of newly  born calves  and of veal calves  are 
shown in Figure 1. It is clear that nowadays  practically  all calves are 
used for beef or veal production  and that no reserve  is left. As a con­
sequence  of the high demand,  calf prices have been very high in recent  
years and to a small extent  young  calves  have been imported  from the 
U.K. and Ireland.
The slaughterings  of full grown  cattle in the period 1970-1979  are given  
in Table 1. Of a total of about 1 million  slaughterings  60-65%  were 
culled cows and 15-20%  were culled heifers. As a consequence  of the 
high level of (concentrate)  feeding  on the dairy farms most of these 
animals  are ready  for slaughter  when they leave the dairy farm and they 
are sent to the slaughterhouses  directly.  According  to the May census  
about  40,000  (6%)  of these animals  are fattened  for some time on pasture  
or indoors  before  they are slaughtered.  Fifteen  to twenty  per cent of the 
slaughterings  consisted  of steers and bulls. The percentage  of slaughter ­
ings of steers  decreased  from 3 to 1 % whereas  the contribution  of bulls  
increased  from 11 to 18%. The total number  of bulls that were slaught ­
ered remained  more or less stable since 1974.

Structure  of beef production
In the same period there was a strong development  to increase  the 
scale of operation.  The number  of farms with less than 20 beef 
animals  decreased  from 31,000  to 16,000  whereas  the number  of farms  
with more than 50 beef animals  increased  from 300 to 1000 (Table  
2). In this regard  there are strong  regional  differences.  The development  
in beef production  took place in the South and the East of the Nether ­
lands. In this part of the country  there is a sandy soil with possibilities  
for maize growing  and a farm structure  with many small mixed farms.  
Bull beef production  developed  here as a soil linked activity  often in 
combination  with some form of intensive  livestock  farming  such as pigs 
or poultry.  In the North  and West of the Netherlands,  farmers  had more  
possibilities  for specialization  in dairy or arable farming.  Consequently  
there was less interest  in the development  of beef production  in this part 
of the country.

System  or bull beef production
The common  system  of bull beef production  is an intensive  system  in 
which newly bom calves are weaned,  fattened  and finished  entirely  in­
doors without  grazing. After a rearing  period of three months  in an 
insulated  calf house the calves  move into a non-insulated  fattening  unit. 
In the fattening  stage the bulls are fed maize silage ad libitum  plus a 
limited  amount  of concentrates  (2-4 kg) for about a year. If grass is 
available  on the farm,  it is fed in summer  in a zero grazing  system  and/or  
grass silage is fed in winter in combination  with maize silage. Near  
industrial  areas in some cases waste products  of breweries,  distilleries,  
potato  chip industries,  etc. are being used.
Calves  may be purchased  either  directly  from dairy farmers  or from  
independent  collectors.  Most calves  are brought  to so-called  collecting  
centres  for further  selection  and are grouped  according  to the specific  
demand  of the individual  beef producers.  The rearing  and fattening  is 
normally  practiced  on the same farm and there is no trading  of animals  
of intermediate  stages  of production.  Also, for the sale of the bulls the 
role of the live markets  is decreasing  and most of the bulls are sold 
directly  to slaughter  houses. The live markets  are used primarily  for the 
sale of steers,  heifers  and cows. Some farmers  specialize  in the rearing  
of so-called  “start calves ” that are sold as weaned  calves  at an age of 3
15
to 4 months.  Most of these calves  are sold for export  to Germany  and 
Italy. For bull beef, calves  of the Red and White breed are preferred  
whereas  the male calves  of the Black and White Friesian  and all female  
calves  that are not kept as replacements  are used for veal production.  
Male calves  of the Red and White breed can be fattened  in an intensive 
feeding  system to a carcase  weight of 300-320  kg without  becoming 
overfat. With the Black and White Friesians  the acceptable  carcase  
weight  in such a system  is 280 kg.
Crossbreeding  with beef breeds
With regard  to the suitability  for beef production  of the available  calves  
it should  be kept in mind that the main interest  of the dairy farmer  lies 
in the production  of milk. This is demonstrated  in the development  of 
first insemination  of dairy breeds  and beef breeds  over the past five years  
(Table  3). It is clear from these figures  that the major  development  has 
been in the use of semen from Holstein  Friesian  bulls and this means  
generally  a decrease  of the beef production  suitability  of the offspring.

There  is also an increase  in the use of semen  of the beef breeds  but in 
1979 this was still less than 1% of the total number  of inseminations.  In 
the beef breeds  the semen  of double  muscled  bulls of our MRY-breed  is 
included  and in 1979 these inseminations  amounted  to 44% of the total 
of the semen  of beef breeds. The number  of double  muscled  animals  in 
the MRY-breed  is small and there is only a limited  commercial  interest
16
in the breeding  and fattening  of these animals.  With the use of these 
double  muscled  bulls the use of caesarean  sections  at birth is normally  
accepted.  On the other hand there is a certain  interest  on daily farms  
for commercial  crossbreeding  with beef breeds,  but only under  the con­
dition that there will be no extra risk at calving.  In the 1960 ’s there has 
been extensive  research  with the Charolais  and Limousin  breed. Berg ­
strom compared  9 Charolais  and 9 Limousin  bulls that were selected  on 
easy calving. With regard to the effect on growth,  conformation  and 
fatness  the Charolais  crosses  gave the best results,  whereas  the crosses 
of the Limousin  and MRY were intermediate  between  the Charolais  
crosses  and the pure Dutch  Friesian.  Although  the Charolais  bulls gave 
also the highest  percentage  of difficult  calvings  the results  were judged  
acceptable  for practieal  application  (Table 4). On the basis of these 
results  an insemination  programme  with Charolais  semen  was developed  
in practice.

During  the practical  application,  the number  of difficult  calvings  rose 
to a level that was not acceptable  to the average  Dutch dairy farmer.  
This had important  implications  not only for the Charolais  breed but 
generally  for the possibilities  of the beef crosses  in the Netherlands.  In 
1973/1974  another  comparison  between  different  beef breeds  was made  
by Brunnekreef  and in this experiment  Piedmont  crosses  came out very 
well with regard  to calving  difficulties  and beef production  results  (Table
5).

Since 1976 we have been working  on Piedmont  crosses  with regard  to 
calving  difficulties  and suitability  of the crosses  for bull beef, heifer  beef 
and veal production  (Tables  6, 7 and 8). So far the results  have been  
promising  and there is a growing  interest  in practice  for the Piedmont

It’s true  what  th^ 
in Ireland  the  grass  Kgreenei:
When  it comes  to the quality  of dairy  pasture,  diere ’s no 
other  country  in Europe  that Irish  farmers  need  envy.  Irish 
pasture  land,  Irish  grass,  is ideal  for the production  of the milk 
from  which  the world ’s best  dairy  products  are made.
As a result,  Irish  dairy  products  are bough  t and enjoyed  
the world  over-many  of them  bearing  the world-famous  
Kerrygold  label.  They  account  for one-eighth  of our  total  exports  - 
an impressive  £535  million  plus-and  because  the import  
content  islow,  the economic  contribution  is huge.
But  our  world-wide  market  is steadily  increasing  and so 
we must  maintain-and  increase-our  productivity  to match  that 
demand.
And  if we do, that expansion  will be matched  by sales;  
sales  of Irish  butter,  cream,  powders,  cheese  and other  dai ry 
products.
So remember,  we have  the land, 
we have  the climate,  we have  the people.
Let ’s make  the most  of them.

semen. In 1979 33% of the inseminations  of the beef breeds  were of the 
Piedmont  semen. In 1979 33% of the inseminations  of the beef breeds  
were of the Piedmont  bulls. However,  the results  have been based on 
only a small number  of Piedmont  bulls that were not of the extreme  
double  muscled  type. The question  is whether  we will be able to select  
in future sufficient  bulls of the intermediate  typie of Piedmont  bulls. If 
we succeed  in this there will certainly  be more interest  for this type of 
beef cross on the average  Dutch  dairy farm.
The requirements  for further  progress  are ;
1. Guaranteed  easy calvings.
2. Guaranteed  colour  marking.
3. Guaranteed  higher  prices.
At this moment  the Piedmont  crosses  meet more or less these require ­
ments.
Feeding  systems
Another  important  aspect of profitable  beef farming  is the feeding 
system. Under  our circumstances  feeding  costs form about  50% of total 
production  costs. The system  that has developed  as the common  system  
is based on the use of 50 kg milk replacer  during  the rearing  period,  and 
from three months  of age onwards  maize  silage  ad libitum  is complemen ­
ted with 2-4 kg of concentrates.  In such a scheme  MRY-bulls  will be 
ready  for slaughter  in 16 months  with a carcase  weight  of about  300 kg. 
Of course  all kinds  of variations  in the ration  are found  depending  on the 
availability  of certain  feeding  stuffs.
Ons of the aspects  of most interest  to Irish farmers  is the role of grass  
and grass silage in such a system. In the Netherlands,  on many farms  
with bull beef, some grass or grass silage is available.  One of the pos­
sibilities  is feeding  the grass  as fresh grass in a zero-grazing  system. This 
can give good technical  results  but has relative  high labour  and machinery  
costs. The feeding  of fresh grass in summer  and grass silage in winter  
increases  the need for concentrate  supplementation  with at least 2 kg of 
concentrates  per day. This is demonstrated  in Table 9 where  results  are
20
given of an experiment  where grass silage was compared  with maize 
silage. With a fixed level of 2 kg of concentrates  extra with the grass  
silage ration,  results  were even sli^tly  less with the grass silage ration  in 
comparison  with the maize silage ration.

Another  experiment  was aimed at the question  whether  it was best to 
give grass silage in the early period  or in the final fattening  period. By 
offering  a product  in the first half of the fattening  period  the total intake  
of that product  is lower because  the intake per animal  is in that period  
lower.
From Table 10 it is clear  that the fattening  period  was shorter, the price 
per kg carcase  was higher and the feed conversion  was better as the 
amount  of maize  silage  in the diet increased.  From  this experiment  it was 
concluded  that when grass and maize silage are available  on a farm and 
when one wants to feed one product  at a time to a certain  group of 
animals  it is best to feed grass silage to the younger  animals  and reserve 
the maize silage for the final fattening  period.
A recent  development  to improve  feed conversion  in rations  for beef 
production  is the addition  of growth promoters  like Monensin  and 
Flavomycine.  Since 1978 these two antibiotics  are accepted  in the Nether ­
lands as feed additive  to concentrates.  The effect of Monensin  was 
studied  in a series  of experiments  in co-operation  with Eli Lilly Benelux. 
The results are given in Table 11. In the all-concentrate  ration, the 
amount  of concentrates  was kept at the same level and no difference  in 
growth  rate was found. In the rations  with maize  silage and grass silage

there was in both cases  a decrease  in the roughage  intake  and an increase 
of liveweight  gain. This led to an improvement  of the feed efficiency  of 
7.2% in the maize  silage  ration  and of 6.8% in the grass silage  ration. In 
these two cases in the rumen  a significant  increase  in the percentage  of 
propionic  acid was found and a slight  non-significant  increase  in the pH.

Health  problems
An important  condition  for a good economic  result is a minimum  of 
illness  and mortality  during  rearing  and fattening.  On average  veterinary  
costs amount  to £30 per animal  and mortality  ab^out  £50 per animal.  The 
main risk is an outbreak  of some bacterial  or virus infection  that can 
cause high losses in incidental  cases. The first difficulty  encountered  by 
fatteners  of young  bulls is the acquisition  of sound animals  as starting  
material.  In the rearing  phase,  bacterial  infections  with Coli, Salmonella  
and Pasteurella  form the main problems.  In this phase  good hygiene  and 
ventilation  in combination  with immediate  treatment  in case of illness 
are essential.  In a later phase  virus  infections  with IBR (Infectious  Bovine 
Rhino  Trachitis)  and RSBV  (Respiratory  Syncytial  Bovine  Virus)  can be 
very dangerous.  At an age of 3 months  normally  all animals  are vaccin ­
ated against  IBR and about a month later against  RSBV. The main  
problem  is that the RSBV  vaccination  is too late and that animals  are 
already  infected  in a younger  stage. Research  is now in progress  to 
protect  the animals  already  in a younger  phase. Losses  and bad growth  
at an older  age are often a result  of a respiratory  infection  in early life.

Economics  of bull beef
The principal  factor  in the development  of bull beef production  was of 
course  the financial  result of this specialization.  In Figure  2 the labour  
income  per bull is given for selected  farms with bull beef production  
registered  by the Agricultural  Economics  Research  Institute.  This labour  
income  per bull varied in the past mne years from —fl54 to +f463  
(Dutch  guilders).  On average  the result was an incentive  for a further  
specialization  in this direction.  Also the E.E.C.  intervention  scheme  has 
had a positive  influence  on this development.
On the other hand the variation  in labour  income  from year to vear 
makes  clear that variations  in calf prices,  feeding  stuffs prices and meat  
prices strongly  influence  the result in the short term. Also it is clear  
from the development  of yield pd costs  that the calculated  labour  income 
has gradually  decreased.  The increase  in meat price has been insufficient  
to compensate  for the rise in cost of the purchased  calf, feedingstuffs, 
housing,  interest,  etc. High calf prices  especially,  as a result of the high 
demand  for veal production,  have had a negative  influence  on profits  in 
beef production.  The result has been that in 1980 practically  no new 
investments  were made in bull beef production.
It is necessary  to make some remarks  on the calculated  costs for 
roughage,  buildings  and interest. With regard to the roughage  costs, 
roughage  is calculated  against  a market  value of fO.35 per kg VEVI or 
f35()0  per ha. In the case of growing  of maize on owned  property,  with 
cultivation,  harvest  and conservation  carried  out by a contractor  one has 
to deal with fl500  direct  costs per ha. In this case there is an additional  
yield of f20(X) per ha or f250 per bull as profit from the land to add to 
the calculated  labour  income. With regard to the calculated  costs for 
buildings,  mechanization  and interest on working  capital the total 
amounts  to f370 per bull.
It is clear that the profitability  of beef production  very much depends  
on the farm situation  with regard  to ownership  of land and buildings  and 
the relation  between  own and borrowed  capital. With a lot of property  
and capital  many  of the calculated  costs are not felt as direct  costs. This 
is perhaps  an important  explanation  why, as a result of the strong  com­
petition,  much more is paid for calves  for beef and veal production  than 
IS possible  on an economic  basis. Unfortunately  there are few possibilities  
for the individual  farmer  to evade the strong  negative  influence  of high 
calf prices  on the profitability  of beef production.  With a decrease  in the 
number  of dairy cows in the E.E.C. the competition  for calves will 
increase  further. This would give an opportunity  for suckler  herds to 
expand  and provide  a higher  proportion  of calves  for beef production.

Beef Production  from the Suckler  
Herd in France
M. DRENNAN

Irish Farmers'  Journal.
In a Farm Study  Tour of France  suckling  systems  based on the Charolais  
breed were examined  and this report  describes  the relevance  of those sys­
tems to Irish conditions.  The Charolais  breed was selected  as it accounts  
for about  40 per cent of the total suckler  herd in France  and is represen ­
tative of the later maturing,  faster growing  breeds. Before discussing 
suckling  systems,  a brief  outline  of beef production  in France  is presented.
Cow herd
The size and composition  of the cow herd in France  is shown  in Table  
1. Twenty-seven  per cent of the national  herd are suckler  cows. While  only 
23 per cent of dairy  herds  and 17 per cent of beef herds  have more than 20 
cows, there has been a gradual  increase  in herd size in recent  years. In 
1969, only about 5 per cent of herds had aver 20 cows.

Type of beef produced
Table  2 shows  that the most prominent  type of beef production  is veal 
although  the number  of calves  used for veal has declined  from 4.4 million  
in 1969 to 3.5 million  in 1979. Cows  account  for 43 per cent of the total 
with the remainder  consisting  of heifers,  steers and bulls in roughly  
equal proportions.  It is noteworthy  that bulls have increased  from 0.28 
million  head in 1969 to 0.75 million  in 1979. However,  bull beef is not 
consumed  in France  and most of it is exported  to Italy, Belgium  and 
Holland.

Suckling
Although  herd size is small most of the 2.7 million  suckler  cows rear 
only their own calf with less than 10 per cent of cows used for multiple  
(mairily  double)  suckling.  In general,  there is little interest  in multiple  
suckling  as in addition  to the labour  involved,  there are more problems  
due to increased  incidence  of calf scours. Lack of interest  in multiple  
suckling  is understandable  as most beef cows are pure beef breeds  with 
relatively  low milk production  potential.  The most prominent  beef cow 
is the Charolais  which totals 1.07 million  or almost  40 per cent of the 
beef cow herd. These are followed  by Limousin  which total about 0.4 
million  or 15 per cent of total beef cows. A number  of different  breeds  
contribute  to the remainder  with a relatively  low proportion  of crossbred  
cows.

The Charolais  herds  are predominantly  found in the central  region  of 
France  (Nevers,  Bourges)  but herds  are also present  in other  areas. There  
are about  4,000 pedigree  Charolais  breeders  and only approximately  10 
per cent of the total breed is registered.  Thus,  the vast majority  of Char ­
olais animals  are used for commercial  beef production.
The production  system practised  in the Charolais  region (central 
France)  can be summarised  as follows  ;
1. Age at first calving  is three years. Some producers  have attempted  
calving  at two years of age but this is generally  avoided  due to 
excessive  calving  problems.
2. The incidence  of caesarean  births is reported  to be about 7 per cent 
in heifers  but the incidence  is low in mature  cows with an overall 
level of about  3 per cent.
The average  number  of calves  produced  per cow is 5. In general,  cows  
are retained  as long as they remain  productive.
Average  calving  date is early March  (range  January-May)  and cows  
are generally  calved  indoors.
The usual method  of breeding  is by running  a bull with the herd. 
However,  in certain  areas artificial  insemination  may be used on a
263.

8.
9.high proportion  of the herd but usually  a bull will be introduced  later 
in the breeding  season.
Highly  muscular  bulls are avoided  for breeding  purposes  because  of 
calving  problems.
Cows  are generally  let to pasture  in April  and are housed  in the period  
November-January.  Depending  on the season  and region some sup- 
p.ementary  feed, such as hay, may be fed at grass  during  dry periods.  
Cows usually  receive  hay in winter  and very little grain is fed. In 
certain areas grass silage and maize silage may also be used for 
feeding  the cows.
Calves  are weaned  in October/November  and in the past were sold as 
stores  at 20 months  of age for fattening  elsewhere.  Presently,  weaning  
bulls (about  300 kg) are frequently  sold for fattening  to Italy or other  
regions  of France  where maize silage is grown. Bulls may also be 
retained  until they are 15 months  old and then sold for fattening  
elsewhere  or may be fattened  on maize silage on the farm. Heifers  
may be sold or retained  for fattening  at 2-3 years.
Charolais  herds are also maintained  in the Nantes  region  on the west 
coast. Maize silage is produced  and all the progeny  are fattened  on 
the farm. Additional  Charolais  bulls  are also purchased  for fattening.  
It was generally  accepted  that the production  of finished  animals  was 
more profitable  than selling  weanlings.
Fattening  systems  for bulls
In the western  region the development  of intensive  fattening  sy.stems  
using bulls coincided  with the production  of maize  silage. In addition  to 
the bull calves  born and reared  on the farms,  extra bulls are purchased  
at weaning  (280-3(B  kg liveweight)  and all are fattened  over the following  
10 months.  A typical  ration per animal  daily is : 
maize silage  — to appetite
grain  — I kg
soya bean meal  — 1 kg
minerals/vitamins  — 150 g
There  can be slight variations  to the above  ration  depending  on silage  
quality  and usually  the level of grain is increased  to 2 kg during  the last 
2-3 months  of fattening.  Liveweight  gains are about 1.3 kg daily during  
the fattening  period and final carcass  weights  410 kg. Yields  of maize 
silage are about 10 tonnes  of dry matter  per hectare  and it was estimated  
that about 4 bulls could be fattened  per hectare.  In some instances  the 
bulls are purchased  for fattening  at about 15 months weighing  450 kg and 
fattened  over a 4-5 month  period  on a similar  diet based on maize  silage  
(daily  gains 1.4 to 1.5 kg per day). While  the area devoted  to maize  grain  
in France  has remained  relatively  constant  during  the 1970 ’s at 1.5 mil­
lion ha., the area of maize silage has increased  from 0.31 million  ha. in 
1970 to 0.98 million  ha. in 1977.
To indicate  the potential  of the various  breeds  body composition  and 
feed efficiency  data of fattening  Friesian,  Charolais  and Limousin  bulls  
are shown  in Table 3. Despite  heavier  final weights,  liveweight  and car­
cass weight  gains were greater  for the beef breeds  than for the Friesians.

Likewise,  they were more efficient  in converting  feed to carcass  gain and

Other  results  (Grey  and Roblein,  1978) have shown  the advantages  in 
terms  of growth  and feed efficiency  of Limousin  compared  with Friesian  
bulls when taken from 300 kg liveweight  to slaughter  (Table  4). At a 
carcass  weight  of 300 kg, Friesian  and Limousin  carcasses  contained  201 
and 231 kg of muscle,  respectively.  The corresponding  figures  for fat in 
carcasses  were 19.2 and 10.6 per cent.

Fattening  systems  for heifers
Unlike  bulls, there is no clear fattening  system  for heifers. In general 
a heavy final liveweight  of about 500-600  kg is the objective.  Rapid  
fattening  from weaning  is not generally  practised  and the majority  are 
fattened  at between  2 and 3 years  of age. Thus,  at least one winter  store 
period followed  by a second  grazing  season precedes  fattening.  When  
fattened  in winter,  maize or grass silage and supplementary  concentrates  
are used.
Cattle  prices
As a guide  to the prices  obtained  for Charolais  animals,  a list of prices  
for Autumn  1980 are shown  in Table 5. Friesians  are included  for com­
parison  purposes  and it is obvious  that quite a premium  is available  for 
Charolais,  particularly  heavy cull cows. While accurate  prices  could be 
obtained  for the different  carcass  grades,  it was difficult  to obtain  figures  
for the different  breeds,  and thus the data in Table 5 should  be used as 
a guide to prices  rather  than a precise  assessment.  With regard  to prices 
received,  a lot of emphasis  was placed  on the conformation  of the animals  
and when conformation  is very good,  higher  prices  can be obtained.  For 
any particular  class of animals,  prices also tended to rise as carcass  
weight  increased.  The price of young  weaned  Charolais  bulls was £150  
per 100 kg liveweight  in October  1980.

Advantages  compared  with Irish conditions
The farmers  involved  with fattening  Charolais  bulls were all members  
of producer  groups  (usually  300-600  members  per group). The producer  
groups  operate  in co-operation  with ONIBEV  (the French  national  inter ­
professional  cattle and beef industry  development  agency)  who in addit ­
ion to providing  technical  information  are involved  in operating  interven ­
tion, carcass  classification,  market  research  and aids to producer  groups. 
The overall  objective  of ONIBEV  is to increase  the efficiency  of beef 
production  by improving  production  at farm level and marketing  of the 
produce.  The advantages  of membership  of a producer  group  include  :
1. Arrangement  of loans  amounting  to a maximum  of 80 per cent of the
30
2.
4.sale value of the animal  at an interest  rate of 10.7 per cent. These  
loans are provided  by Credit Agricole.  The producer  group will 
guarantee  the loans but in general  ONIBEV  would prefer  that the 
loan should  not exceed  the purchase  price of animals.
By signing  a contract  to sell animals  through  the group,  the sale price 
of bulls and steers  is guaranteed.  The guaranteed  price is approxim ­
ately 96% of the guide price and if market  prices are lower at sale 
the difference  will be paid. However,  it is necessary  that the animals  
reach slaughter  at the pre-arranged  date and meet the specified  
weight and quality requirements.  Only animals  in EURO  of the 
EUROPA  classification  scale qualify  for the guaranteed  prices. The 
overall  rejection  rate appears  to be low. No such guarantee  applies  
to heifers  or cows. Veal is not eligible.
There is a minimum  guaranteed  price for suckled  weanling  bulls  
which  in 1980 was £138 per 100 kg liveweight  for Charolais.  However,  
as the market  price was £150 per 100 kg this would  not apply.
A flat rate headage  premium  is paid which varies  with the duration  
of the contract.  The premium  per head is £5.80,  £11.60  and £17.40  
when the animals  are retained  on the farm for longer  than 6, 12 or 18 
months  resfiectively.
In addition,  the French  Government  have agreed to make headage  
payments  similar  to the E.E.C. in the recently  introduced  Beef Cow 
scheme  up to a herd size of 40 cows.
Membership  of a group  involves  a charge  of about  £15 per animal  but 
there is a net gain from membership  in addition  to the credit facilities. 
The membership  charge  includes  cost of animal  transport  and other such 
facilities.
Application  of Charolais  systems  to Irish conditions
As neither  availability  of purebred  Charolais  or maize silage apply,  a 
proposed  system  for Ireland  would have to be an altered  version  of the 
system practised  in France. The big attraction  of the French  system  
includes :
1. the high prices  per kg paid for both the progeny  and cull cows
2. high  sales  of carcass  per cow due to slaughter  at heavy  weights.
A proposed  system  for Ireland  would  not necessarily  include  just one 
breed and first calvings  at three years of age as practised  in France  is 
undesirable.  It is therefore  proposed  that starting  with possibly  a Char ­
olais X Friesian  heifer,  these could be bred to calve at two years of age 
using a Limousin  sire. Charolais  or Simmental  sires would  be used sub­
sequently  but Limousin  sires wou^l  continue  to be used on replacement  
heifers. In the early years  a high rate of turnover  of the cow herd would  
be necessary  to allow upgrading  with replacements  coming  from within  
the herd.
A definite  decision  would need to be made initially  as to whether  to 
produce  young  bulls for sale at about  18 months  of age or steers  at 24-26
31
months. While the steers would be suitable  for the French  market  the 
markets for  the bulls  would  include  Italy,  Belgium  and Holland.
Production  of bulls at 17-18  months
Assuming  February/March  calving  the bulls could be sold fat in July 
at about 17 months.  Weaning  would take place in November  and they 
would  be fed indoors  from November  to slaughter  on high quality  grass  
silage plus concentrates.  Liveweight  at weaning  would be about 300 kg 
and assuming  a daily gain of 1J kg per day a feeding  period  of 240 days  
is needed  to provide  a total gain of 300 kg and a final liveweight  of 600 
kg. While  this is lower  than the final liveweight  obtained  in France  with 
the pure bred Charolais,  mature  size would be less particularly  when 
upgrading  and due to the use of Limousin  sires on heifers. To achieve  
these targets  it is essential  that the silage must be of very high quality.  
Using silage with a dry matter  digestibility  in excess  of 75 per cent, the 
performance  of Charolais  cross bulls in experiments  at Grange  (Table  6) 
indicate  that these weight  gains can be achieved.

Fattening  at two years
In this system  no attempt  is made to fatten  during  the first winter  and 
the animals  are let to pasture  for a second grazing  season. They are 
subsequently  fattened  during  the second  winter  on high quality  silage  and 
concentrates  to give carcass  weights  for steers in excess  of 340 kg. A 
similar  type system  could  be used with bulls but management of the older  
bulls at pasture  may not be suitable  in all situations  and in general  when 
bulls  are produced  it is preferable  to fatten  at the younger  ages.
Economic  returns  from Continental  type suckling  systems
The following  inputs  and outputs  are proposed  for a system  in which 
by ugrading  and retention  of replacements  from within the herd, a 
herd is developed  with a very high proportion  of Continental  (Charolais,  
Limousin  or Simmental)  blood. Bulls are fattened  at 17 months  of age 
and when fed silage plus 3 kg of concentrates  daily from weaning  to 
slaughter  attain a carcass  weight  of 350 kg. Heifers  are fattened  at two 
years of age and fed silage plus 1.0 and 2.5 kg of concentrates  per head
32
daily during  their first and second  winter periods,  respectively.  In the 
earlier  years a high replacement  rate is proposed  and carcass  weights  of 
young  cull cows and heifers  are estimated  to be 300 kg. The area of 
grassland  (grazing  plus silage)  required  per cow and progeny  to slaughter  
IS 1.7 acres. Using these figures  and either standard  cattle prices,  or a 
premium  of 30p pep kg of carcass  above standard  prices  gross margins  
per cow and per acre are shown  in Table 7. The gross  margins  per acre 
using standard  prices,  are quite similar  to those expected  where using 
a Friesian  cross  (preferably  Limousin)  suckler  dam sired by a continental  
sire breed. Therefore,  in order  to have a worthwhile  financial  advantage  
from the introduction  of a specialised  continental  type suckler  herd, it 
IS essential  that a premium,  of the order mentioned,  is obtained  for the 
carcasses.
Table 7

In the foreseeable  future,  the dairy herd in Ireland  will not provide  
adequate  numbers  of calves and, in fact, it is desirable  to increase  the 
size of the suckler  herds. Presently  suckler  cows account  for approxim ­
ately 25 per cent of the total cow population.  As growth  rate of the 
progeny  and final carcass  price are important,  continental  sire breeds  
should  be used on suckler  cows. The dam used would ideally  (depends  
on supply)  be a Limousin  x Friesian  from the dairy herd resulting  in the 
j^oduction  of f continental  progeny.  The question  arises as to whether  
this system be altered  and replacements  used from within the herd to 
upgrade  towards  a 100 per cent continental  breed type.
Conclusion
The continental  type suckling  system  described  above would be very 
specialised  and the standard  of management  required  is high. To achieve  
a high degree  of success  individuals  undertaking  the system  should  form  
a producer  group  which would be concerned  both with production  and 
marketing.  As the prices  obtained  for the animals  will be as important  
as high technical  achievement,  close association  with outlet markets  is 
essential.  This is one area which allows  meat factories  to get involved 
from the outset with a producer  group. The factories  should be in a 
jwsition  to outline  the type of animal  required  and guarantee  a price for 
the following  year relative  to the prevailing  price of Friesians  provided  
the product  produced  meets  the standards  laid down. It must be appre ­
33
ciated that numbers  of animals  will be low in the initial years but these  
would  increase  rapidly  provided  the economic  returns  were satisfactory.
To ensure  satisfactory  numbers  of suckler  cows, it is essential  that a 
suitable  Beef Cow Incentive  Scheme  is available  on a continental  basis.  
Such a scheme  is not only in the interest  of beef cow herd owners  but 
also of beef farmers,  meat factories  and the community  in general  to 
ensure  an adequate  and constant  supply  of beef.

2.Calf to Beef at Eleven  Months  of Age 
on an All Barley  Diet
A. COLGAN  
Lisburn.  Co. Antrim.
In the mid 1970 ’s I sought  a more profitable  beef production  system  for 
my farm which  was then based on the winter  fattening  of store cattle and 
on a two-year  calf to beef system.
Barley  beef offered  a number  of advantages  :
1. Performances  are predictable  and could be costed  accurately.
Early slaughter  at under one year would require  less capital than 
other calf to beef systems  and give a higher return on the capital  
employed.
The use of bulls would  give better  liveweight  gains and food conver ­
sion.
The use of Romensin  would  improve  feed conversion  figures.
Labour  demands  would be low—less material  to handle,  no fencing, 
dosing  or herding  required.
The existing  land could be used to grow grain and offer an alternative  
income  for a low capital  requirement.
The system of barley beef production  is a simple one. Dairy bred 
calves are reared on an early weaning  system and at 10-12 weeks are 
introduced  to an ad libitum  diet based on rolled barley  and containing  
about 15% crude protein. When the cattle are 6 months  old and weigh 
approximately  250 kg the protein  level is reduced  to 13%. The cattle are 
sold on average  at 11 months  of age weighing  425 kg.
The system  in practice
A new specialist  calf rearing  house was erected  in 1979 for 144 calves 
with 12 pens each holding  12 calves. The pens, either side of a central  
passage,  are straw bedded  with sloping  floors to remove  as much liquid 
as possible,  this being piped outside  to a tank. A semi-automatic  feeder  
is used for milk feeding.
Calves  are purchased  from March  to June as this means  that the bulls  
come out as finished  beef in the late spring  when fat cattle supplies  are 
low and therefore  can command  top prices. All Friesian  calves  are now 
purchased,  since the Continental  types  proved  too variable  in performance  
with only 30% justifying  their extra initial  cost.
After weaning  the calves  are transferred  to a slatted  house where  they 
are matched  in groups  of 25-30 and these groups  remain intact until 
slaughter.  The barley  diet is placed  in troughs  using a simple  farm built  
trailer  with a side delivery  auger. The cattle also get about  | kg straw / 
head daily to help the rumen  function.
35
Health problems  at the calf stage include scours and pneumonia.  
Good housing  helps  prevent  pneumonia  and vaccination  is useful  against  
salmonellosis.
At the {X)st-weaning  stage and up to 6 months  of age pneumonia  out­
breaks  may still occur. These are usually  best dealt with by medicating  
the meal and water  for 3-4 days.

Marketing
The beef from these young  bulls is a superior  product  and needs  to be 
distinguished  from that of older cull bulls and heavy bulls from grass 
based systems.  They are lean and well fleshed  and don t have the heavy 
neck development  of an older  bull. On boning  out the^ young  bulls  will 
yield an extra 3-4% meat  over and above  that of a similar  steer.
However,  the best price is got by scarcity,  and my selling  policy  is to 
have the bulls ready for sale during  the spring  period.
My bulls are mostly  sold for the local trade  which  favours  a lightweight 
carcase  and pays a premium  for it. Some are also sold for a vac-packing  
operation  where the extra 3-4% yield can be realised  by the processor  
and a premium  subsequently  paid.

Production  Responses  and Consumer  
Protection  following  the Use of 
Anabolic  Agents  in Beef Production
J. F. ROCHE
The Agricultural  Istitute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
The use of growth  promoters  in beef production  in Ireland  has been  
described  in a previous  article  in this journal  (Roche,  1979).  In this paper,  
the present  position  as regards  use of growth  promoters  in beef cattle is 
summarised  and the safety  of meat to the consumer  following  implanta ­
tion is discussed.
Use in finishing  steers
The available  growth  promoters,  used as ear implants,  are shown in 
Table 1. Ralgro  will increase  growth  rate by 10-18%  and give an extra  
7-10 kg of carcass  weight  over a 120 day experimental  period. Finaplix  
will increase  growth  rate by 15-25%  and give an extra 8-19 kg carcass  
weight  over a 4 month  period. The feed additive,  Romensin, will increase 
daily gain by 10-15%  and carcass  weight  by 6-10 kg over a 4 month  
period. Animals  to be given Romensin  should be introduced  to it 
gradually  and fed 200 mg per day per animal.

Research  has shown  that male type and a female  type growth  promoter  
gives  an additive response.  Thus,  Ralgro  -I- Finaplix  will increase  growth  
rate by 25-30%  and carcass  weight  by 21-20  kg. Both implants  can be
37
inserted  at the same  time. Also,  Synovex-S  + Finaplix  will increase  growth  
rate by 25-40%  and carcass  weight  by 12-25 kg. However,  the behav ­
ioural side effects of Synovex-S  must be considered  and these will be 
discussed  later.
Summary  of combinations  to use in steers
The major  points  to remember  are that additive  responses  are obtained  
when (i) a male  + a female  type growth  promoter  are used or (ii) a growth  
promoter-FRomensin  are used.
1. Male  + female  type growth  promoter — both additive  e.g. RaIgro  + 
Finaplix.
2. One growth  promoter  + Romensin  — both additive  e.g. Ralgro  + 
Romensin  or Synovex-S  + Romensin.
3. Male  + female growth promoter  + Romensin  — are they additive?  
e.g. Ralgro  + Finaplix  + Romensin  — In two of three experiments,  
no additive  response  was found in steers  fed Romensin  when already  
implanted  with Ralgro  + Finaplix.
Use in female  cattle  for beef production
In contrast  to the increased  growth  rate obtained  in steers following 
the use of growth  promoters,  the growth  response  in finishing  females  is 
lower and more variable.  The reasons  for this are not clear at present. 
A summary  of Grange  trials indicate  the following  :
i) Non-significant  responses  to Ralgro  when inserted  1-1|" from base 
of ear.
ii) Significant  responses  to Finaplix  in winter  when animals  are gaining  
oyer 0.55 kg/day  and in summer  on pasture  (4-8 kg carcass  gain).
iii) Significant  responses  to Romensin  (4-8 kg carcass  gain).
iv) Neither  Ralgro  + Finaplix  nor Romensin  + Finaplix  are additive  in 
their growth  response  in heifers.
v) Synovex-H  induces  udder  development  in 20-35%  of heifers  so they 
may be classified  as cow heifers  in meat factories.
Therefore,  the present  state of knowledge  indicates  that in heifers  being  
finished  for beef, either Finaplix  or Romnsin,  give significant  responses. 
In cull cows Finaplix  or Romensin  or Synovex-H  can be used.
Effects  on feed efficiency  and carcass  quality
Trials  carried  out where  feed intake  has been measured  in steers  given  
Ralgro  + Finaplix  indicate  a 3-4% increase  in feed intake for a 30% 
increase  in daily gain. Thus, a major  effect of growth  promoters  is to 
increase  feed efficiency.  In addition,  the hormonal  implants  have a 
positive  effect on increasing  lean meat and reducing  fat trim in the 
carcass.  Thus,  the benefits  from hormonal  growth  promoters  accrue  not 
only from increased  growth  rate but also from better  feed efficiency  and 
more lean meat in the carcass.
Romensin,  since it acts to increase  efficiency  of digestion  in rumen,  
does not affect  carcass  quality.  Thus,  the normal  increase  in fat and lean 
will occur in these animals.

Effects  on behaviour
No undue side effects  on behaviour  have been reported  following  use 
of either  Ralgro  or Finaplix  alone or in combination.
The use of oestrogen  growth  promoters  such as Synovex  has been 
associated  with raised tail head, increased  mounting  behaviour  and 
increased  aggression.  These behavioural  effects  generally  last for 1-10 
days but in extreme  cases a small number  of reports  indicate  effects  
lasting  for 4-10 weeks. In some cases, size of rudimentary  teats can be 
increased.  To minimise  these behavioural  side effects,  one should  avoid  :
i) crushing  implant  when inserting  it;
;ii) implanting  on wet days;
iii) having  group  sizes of implanted  steers  greater  than about  40 in one 
area;
iv) mixing  implanted  steers  with strange  cattle.
If a severe problem  arises, the few steers that allow other steers to 
mount  them, should  be removed  from the group. These animals  should 
not be re-introduced  into the same group. In deciding  to use Synovex-S,  
the effects  on behaviour  should  be taken into account.
Points  to consider
1. Under  no circumstances  should  bulls, heifers  or cows for breeding  be 
implanted  with hormonal  growth  promoters  as they have deleterious  
effects  on reproduction.  Monensin  is, however,  safe to use in breeding  
cattle.
2. Growth  promoters  are an aid to good beef husbandry  practices  and 
not a substitute  for good feeding  and management.  Animals  should 
be on a high plane  of nutrition  in order  to get maximum  benefit  from 
the use of growth  promoters.
3. Implanted  animals cannot  be slaughtered  for 65 days. Therefore,  only 
those that will not be sold for at least two months  should be im­
planted.
4. There is variation  from farm to farm in response  obtained  and no 
clear explanation  is available  for this.
5. Implants  are effective  for 90-130  days. Thereafter,  the animals  will 
gam the normal  weight  as if they had not been implanted  at all. As 
regards  time of slaughter,  the only limitation  is to be sure the 
recommended  withdrawal  period  has elapsed.
Conclusion  on growth  effects
An investment  of £3 in growth  promoters  will give a return  of £15 to 
£25 per animal  treated,  provided  animals are  on a good plane  of nutrition.  
This is an important  boost  to profitability  of beef production.  However,  
use of growth  promoters  brings  with it the added  responsibility  of ensur ­
ing meat from treated  cattle does not contain  undesirable  residues  of 
growth  promoters.
Hazards  to the consumer
A critical  question  is the possible  hazard  to the consumer  when eating  
meat from implanted  cattle. Let us consider  the oestrogens.
40
(A) The Oestrogens : These can be classified  as either steroids  which  
are naturally  occurring  hormones,  or non-steroidal  synthetic  compounds  
such as hexoestrol  or diethyl  stilbestrol  (DES). In discussing  safety,  the 
distinction  between  naturally  occurring  and synthetic  stilbene  compounds  
is critical. Naturally  occurring  hormones  : (i) are easily  biodegraded  to 
inactive  compounds  and are rapidly  excreted  in faeces  or urine;  (ii) have 
low activity  when administered  orally;  (iii) do not persist  for any length  
of time in the body.
In contrast,  synthetic  oestrogens : (i) are not easily biodegraded  since  
they are foreign  to the body and degradative  pathways  do not exist;
(ii) have a high activity  when administered  orally;  (iii) persist  for longer  
in. the body and thus are more potent.
Due to the fact that the synthetic  stilbene  oestrogens  are more toxic  
and potent  and persist  for longer  periods  in the body,  they should  not be 
used for growth  promotion  in cattle. Instead,  the natural  oestrogens  are 
the preferred  products.  The advent  of new assay methodology  called  
radioimmunoassay  can now detect  levels  of hormones  as low as 10“® to 
10''^ of a gram. This has then allowed  us to examine  the exposure  of 
humans  to natural  sex hormones  :
i) Daily production  rate : Table 2 shows  that daily production  rates  
of oestrogens  in humans  are very high, depending  on the particular  
physiological  state. These hormones  are present  in the embryo  shortly  
after conception  and humans  are exposed  to them daily for the rest of 
their lives. The high amounts  produced  are rapidly  broken down  and are 
excreted  continuously  and are very high compared  with the small amount  
present  in meat from implanted  cattle.

ii) Daily intakes: Many common  foods contain  high levels of sex 
steroids  and Table 3 shows  that the levels present  in milk or meat from 
pregnant  animals  is far higher  than the level found in meat of a steer  
implanted  with Synovex-S  and slaughtered  61 days later. The hormone  
levels in meat treated  cattle are low compared  to those in certain  other  
foodstuffs.
Table 3

Milk from pregnant  cow 126 pg/ml
Meat from pregnant  cow or heifer 2500-5500  pg/ml
Wheat  germ4000 pg/g
Soyabean  oil2000 pg/g
Meat from Synovex-S  implanted  steer  
(at 61 days)22 pg/g
iii) Natural  sources:  Over 40 plant species  contain  oestrogens  and 
sheep grazing Trifolium  suhterraneum  pastures  in New Zealand  and 
Australia  have a high level of infertility  due to oestrogens.  Soyabeans,  
wheat  germ, lucerne,  apples,  cherries,  potatoes,  garlic and hops contain  
varying  amounts  of oestrogens.
iv) Artificial  sources : Synthetic,  orally active oestrogens  are used by 
millions  of women  daily either as birth control  pills or as hormonal  
replacement  therapy  to relieve post-menopausal  syndrome.  The daily  
quantities  ingested  are in the microgram  range (10“ ® gram).
Because  of the high endogenous  production  rate of natural  sex steroids  
by man and of the high daily consumption  rate from normal  constituents  
of the daily human  diet, the use of natural  hormones  in beef production  
will have no significant  impact  on the total exposure  of the consumer  to 
steroidal  hormones.
(B) TIm A^rogens  : The major  male sex steroid  being used for growth  
promotion  is the synthetic  steroid trenbolone  acetate (Finaplix).  This 
compound  is very similar  in structure  to the naturally  occurring  hormone,  
testosterone.  It has the anabolic effects  of testosterone  but does not cause  
secondary  sexual behaviour  such as mounting  or aggression.  Following  
insertion  of implants  of trenbolene  acetate  in the ear, the compound  is 
released  slowly  over a 60-80  day period. The levels  of trenbolone  acetate  
in cattle  slaughtered  60 days after implantation  are lower  than residues  of 
testosterone  in muscles,  liver, kidney  and fat. The major  metabolite  of 
trenbolone  has a much lower biological  activity  than that of the parent  
compound.
42
Life-span  studies  in mice and rats show no abnormal  pathology  follow ­
ing its administration.  Meat from cattle implanted  with a normal  or 25 
times  higher  than normal  dose of trenbolone  acetate  has been fed to rats. 
No treatment  related  toxicological  effect was detected  in the rats fed the 
treated  meat, indicating  that trenbolone  acetate  and its metabolites  in 
cattle were not toxic in any way to rats.
(C) Non-hormonal  Anabolic  Agents : Resorcylic  acid lactone  (Ralgro)  
is a non-hormonal  compound  which increases  the level of growth  hor­
mone in cattle. This compound  has certain  weak oestrogenic  character ­
istics and whether  or not it is an oestrogen  is controversial.  There  are no 
detectable  residues  in meat in cattle slaughtered  60 days after implanta ­
tion, down to the sensitivity  of 0.1 ng/gram  tissue. When given in high 
doses  to monkeys,  dogs and rats in life-time  studies,  no abnormal  pathol ­
ogy has been observed.  Thus, the available  evidence  to date suggests  that 
it is a safe compound  to use in animal  production.
Problems
The major  concerns  in relation  to public  health  arise from :
i) Use of undesirable  products  such as the stilbene  synthetic  oestrogens,  
e.g. DES.
ii) Misuse  of “safe” or cleared  products  resulting  in undesirably  high 
residues  in meat.
In relation  to the first point, the stilbene  derivatives  should not be 
prescribed  by veterinary  surgeons  or sold by pharmacists  as anabolic  
agents. The naturally  occurring  oestrogens  or resorcyclic  acid lactone  
should  be used instead.
As regards  misuse  of recommended  products,  this can arise from :
i) Inserting  the implant  in a site other than the ear. This should  never  
be performed  as there can be some unabsorbed  compound  at the 
site of implantation  for periods  of up to 6 months.  If the implant  is 
inserted  properly  in the ear, it will not pose a hazard  to the consumer  
as the ear is discarded  at slaughter  with the skin.
ii) Slaughtering  animals  less than 60-65 days after implantation  means  
that there can be high residues  in meat. In order  to ensure  that there  
are safe or undetectable  levels of residues,  cattle should not be 
slaughtered  until the recommended  period  of 60-65  days has elapsed.
iii) Using  higher  than the recommended  dose.
iv) Injecting  animals  with androgens  one to two weeks  before  slaughter.  
This injection  is of no benefit  and can result  in high residues  in meat.
Repeat  implantation  should  be limited  until the effect of repeat  implan ­
tation on residues  has been evaluated.
Conclusions  on safety
The substantial  evidence  available  at present  indicates  that the anabolic  
agents  used in Ireland  (Finaplix,  Ralgro  and Synovex),  when  administered  
as recommended,  are safe and do not put the consumer  at risk. It is 
essential  that anabolic  agents  are used as recommended;  misuse  may lead
43
to a total ban. Cattle  should  only be implanted  after careful  consideration  
of the important  fact that they must be retained  for 65 days before 
slaughter.  Thus, it is necessary  to consider  factors  such as, expected  or 
unexpected  changes  in beef prices; degree of finish of cattle; expected  
selling  date and amount  of feed. Consumer  protection  from misuse  of 
cleared  products  or from illegal use of undesirable  products  could be 
improved  by (i) stricter  control  on their availability;  (ii) routine  random  
monitoring  of meat for residues  of growth  promoters  and condemnation  
of any carcass  with undesirably  high levels  of residues  as unfit for human  
consumption;  (iv) educating  people  not to misuse  them. The farmer,  by 
proper  use and adherence  to recommendations,  can ensure  their  continued  
use by not putting  consumers  at risk.

Financing  Intensive  Beef Production
P. C. McFEELY
Bank  of Ireland,  Area —fVes/, Galway
The dismal  returns  from cattle farming  in Ireland  were highlighted  once 
again in the recent Farm Management  Survey  Data which showed  that 
farms  classified  as Mainly  Dry Stock  had a decline  of 37 % in income  per 
farm in 1979 to £1,874(1).  The point has been made at previous  Irish  
Grassland  and Animal  Production  Association  meetings  (2,3)  that money  
can be made from cattle production  in Ireland  with modest  technical  
input  and poor live-weight  gain per acre. However,  such success  in cattle  
trading  is inevitably  at the expense  of some producer  within  the chain  
from calf-to-beef,  and it would seem illogical  that this should  continue  
indefinitely.  Present  conventional  wisdom  is that serious  cattle farmers  
must turn to more intensive  systems  requiring  high technical  expertise  
and output  per unit area. This paper  examines  the economics  of adopting  
several  of the most widely  recommended  systems,  some of whom  are still 
in their infancy,  in this country  .
The following  assumptions  have been made :
(a) The farmer  owns his land with no outstanding  debt.
(b) All necessary  buildings  have been provided  from farmer ’s own funds.
(c) Farmer  has his own silage making  equipment  so that total control  
over silage quality  is available.
(d) Home ^own barley,  storage  and mixing  facilities  are available  so 
that ration  costs are £20/£25  per ton lower  than the normal  commer ­
cial rate.
In all three systems  analysed,  a high standard  of technical  performance  
is assumed;  the sensitivity  analyses  indicate  the implications  for profit ­
ability  when these standards  are not achieved.  A 60-acre  farm unit was 
used throughout  the exercise.  The major  assumptions  for three systems 
are as follows :
1. Calf-to-beef  (24 month  system)
Stocking  rate : 1 livestock  unit per acre 
Calf purchase  price — £80 per head  
Total variable  costs (Year 1) —

Variable  costs (1-2 y.o.) as in calf-to-beef  system  (2 y.o.)
Weight  targets/sale  price — as in calf-to-beef  system  (2 y.o.)
3. Continental-style  16-month  old bull beef
Stocking  rate : 2 L.U. per acre (system  conducted  exclusively  indoors  
on silage plus concentrates)
Calf purchase  price @ £80 per head  
Variable  costs  (0-6 months  stage)  — £68 per head
Variable  costs  (6-12 months)  — £78 per head
Variable  costs  (12-16  months)  — £93 per head
Sale weight —508 kg (285 kg carcase)
Sale price @ £95.25/100  kg 
Lifetime  performance£484 per head  
1.0 kg gain/day
In the three systems  a consistently  low mortality  of 1.5% was pro­
jected. Likewise,  all systems  were assumed  to carry the same level of 
fixed costs (£2,200  p.a.) and living expenses  £4,500 p.a.); an overdraft  
interest  rate of 15% was assumed  throughout.
Comparative  financial  evaluation  of the three systems  is on the basis 
of cash flow projections  (Tables  1, 2 and 3) carried  forward  to the point  
of run-off  on a permanent  overdraft.  The 24-month  calf-to-beef  system  
leaves  a residue  of £23,000  approximately  after the first sale which can 
be converted  to a term loan. This system  would only break even after

payment  of interest  on working  capital  and repayment  of a 7-year  term 
loan with no contingency  buffer. The 24-month  weanling-to-beef  system  
is slightly  superior  due to more rapid stock turnover  but any advantage  
would  be highly  dependent  on maintenance  of the projected  weanling-to-  
calf pricing  differential.  The pay-back  period  would  be reduced  from 7.5 
years (calf-to-beef)  to 6.25 years (weanling-to-beef).  The more intensive  
16-month  system  with highest  sales and most rapid stock turnover  has 
a pay-back  period  of less than 3.5 years. However,  this system  requires  
the highest  level of technical  performance,  assumes  a sale price premium  
of £5.25/100  kg over the other two systems,  and is more sensitive  to 
price changes  because  of the additional  stock numbers  carried.
Margin  sensitivity  to changes  in calf price,  live weight  gain, and selling  
price is summarised  iu Table 4. Whilst  all systems  are vulnerable,  the 
16-month  system is particularly  exposed  if calves are over-priced  and 
selling weight/price  targets  are not achieved.  The sensitivity  analysis  
over-simplifies  the practical  situation,  where lighter animals  could be 
unfinished  (or even unsaleable)  and unlikely  to realise the projected  
top-of-the-market  price. Such situations  could arise from reduced  inputs  
in ill-advised  efforts  to reduce  costs; the co-efficients  used in all three  
systems  leave little opportunity  for input reduction  without  impaired  
animal  performance.

Total interest  paid during  the build-up  period  (Table  5) varies  within  
the range  £5/6,000  but interest  charge  per animal  is almost  halved  in the 
16-month  system vs. the 24-month  calf-to-beef  system. A 5% cut in 
interest  rate would  increase  surplus  by £1,000  approximately  in the 2 y.o. 
calf-to-beef  system  and by £1,500  approximately  in the 16-month  system  
during the build-up  phase. Projected  gross  margins  are shown  in Table  6.
The levels of fixed costs (£2,200  p.a.>' and family living expenses 
(£4,500  p.a.) ’^ may be criticised  on the basis of (1) being  too low, and (2) 
being charged  entirely  against  the 60-acre  unit when there is a clear  
implication  throughout  the exercise  that a larger  farm unit is envisaged 
to provide home-grown  grain. Upward  adjustment  of one or both 
elements  will extend  the pay-back  period.

Requiremente/Advantages  of intensive  systems
1. More accurate,  predictable  planning  of financial  requirements.
2. Independent  of more extreme  cattle trading  fluctuations.
3. High quality  silage (68/70  D-value).
4. Excellent  grassland  management  for 24-month  systems.
5. First-class  stockmanship.
6. Development  of marketing  arrangement  which will ensure  premium  
price for good quality  animal  supplied  on a guaranteed  basis.
Weakness/disadvantages  of intensive  systems
1. High capital  investment  especially  for housing —in this exercise  peak 
overdraft  varied  from £52,000  to £69,000.
2. Farmer  requires  own silage  machinery  to ensure  quality  control  which 
further  increases  capital  expenditure.
3. Margins  sensitive  to concentrate  price so availability  of home-grown  
grain is probably  an essential  feature  of such systems  tending  to make  
them inappropriate  for many  small/medium  sized farms.
4. Sensitive  to calf price and interest  rate especially  during  build-up  
phase.
5. Efficiency  standards too demanding for average  dry stock  farmer.
6. Absence  of guaranteed  premium  price at present  for beef could mean  
significantly  lower average  return  to the producer  than budgeted  in 
the paper.
50
7. Increased  demand  for autumn/early  spring-bom  calves  could  increase  
price substantially.
8. Disease  problems  especially  viral infections.

Introduction
The importance  of grass and forage  crops in the feeding  of livestock  in 
the U.K. has been widely  recognised  (a.g. Food from our own Resources,  
HMSO,  1975). Estimates  suggest  that c 80% of the metabolisable  energy 
(ME)  requirement  of the ruminant  population  is met from this source  but 
for dairy cows the estimated  contribution  has only been in the region  of 
54 to 66% of requirement  over the last decade. More detailed  analysis  
of the winter  period (Table 1) suggests  that conserved  forages  supplied 
only 43 to 51% of winter  ME requirement  of the cow and this corres ­
ponded  to 87 to 98% of maintenance  energy  requirement.

Assumptions  : 600 kg LW, 35 kg LW loss, concentrate  11 MJ ME/kg  fresh weight
These estimates  should  be considered  as the potential  contribution  of 
conserved  forages,  since a wide variety  of purchased  bulk fodders  and 
fresh forage  are used to supplement  conserved  forages  on the farm in the 
UK (MAFF/ADAS,  1975). Further,  estimates  of the contribution  of grass  
and forage  crops derived  from survey  data must be treated  with a great  
deal of caution  since they are calculated  by difference  and include
52
assumptions  of cow live weight,  live-weight  loss and ME content  of 
concentrates.
However,  the data indicate  little evidence  that the contribution  of 
conserved  forage to the cow ’s diet has been increasing  over the last 
decade  despite  the fact that the amount  of forage  conserved  as silage has 
been increasing  and also that the quality  (ME, DCP) of this material  is 
higher  than that of hay. The objective  of this paper  is to examine  some  
of the factors  which can influence  the contribution  of silage to the diet 
of the dairy cow.
Digestibility  of herbage
One of the major  factors  influencing  the nutritional  value of grass cut 
for conservation  is the digestibility  of the material  at the time of cutting.  
The results  of two experiments  conducted  at the GRI to investigate  the 
influence  of digestibility  on milk yield are shown  in Table  2.

In the first trial (Tayler  and Aston,  1976)  the digestibility  of the mater ­
ial had no effect on milk output  since intake  was lower with the silage  
of higher  digestibility.  This resulted  from a poorer  fermentation  pattern  
of the higher  digestibility  silage. An additive  consisting  of equal  volumes  
of formic  acid and formalin  was used in the second  experiment  (Thomp ­
son, Daley,  Aston and Hughes,  1981). Little difference  in fermentation  
pattern  between  the two silages  was noted and earlier  cutting  resulted  in 
a slightly  higher  silage intake,  a higher  milk yielid but a lower  milk fat 
content.  The achievement  of higher  yields  through  increased  digestibility  
is possible  but not consistently  so as a result  of variations  in the fermen ­
tation  quality  of silage. Thus  fermentation  pattern  is an important  factor  
modifying  the effect of digestibility  and good fermentation  is essential  to 
realise  the potential  of higher  digestibility  silages.
53
Earlier  cutting  and increased  frequency  of cutting  to produce  higher  
quality  material  for conservation,  however,  results  in a reduction  in grass 
DM and often in digestible  organic  matter  (OM) yield. The integration  
of milk yield and agronomic  data is shown in Table 3.

* Plot digestible  OM yields reduced  by 40%
The results  indicate  that the use of cutting  systems  to produce  silages  
of relatively  low quality  resulted  in the highest  yields  of digestib'e  OM 
per hectare  which combined  with a higher  concentrate  input enabled  a 
higher  stocking  density  and higher  milk output  per hectare.
Thus, although  cutting  systems  which produce  high digestibility  silage  
will allow an increased  milk production  per cow or a saving  in concen ­
trate input, they will often result in a reduction  in milk output per 
grassland  hectare. The extent of this reduction  and the economic  con­
sequences  will depend  on grass growing  conditions  and the nature  of the 
constraints  on the individual  farms. This all demonstrates  that the choice  
of a cutting  frequency  is a vital one but also not a simple one. The 
interaction  between  output per cow and per hectare  requires  further  
investigation  under different  grass growing  conditions  and different  sys­
tems of production.
Fermentation  quality
The objective  of an effective  conservation  strategy  is to produce  silage  
of high intake  characteristics  which  will result in increased  milk produc ­
tion and reduction  in losses. The aim is to produce  silage with an 
ammonia-N  content  of <5% of total N, acetic acid of ^2.5%  of DM 
and with the absence  of other volatile  acids. The techniques  normally  
used to achieve  these objectives  are wilting,  additive  and variation  in 
chop length.
54
Wilting
The results  of experiments  which  have examined  the effect of wilting  
herbage  prior  to ensiling  on milk yield are shown  in Figure  1.

WILTED
Milk yield  
(kg)
UNWILTED
The data show that wilting  did not result in a consistent  increase  in 
milk yield, despite  the fact that in most trials wilting  resulted  in an 
increased  intake  of silage. A further  review  of data (Wilkins,  R. J., un­
published)  has also shown  that wilting  did not increase  milk yield despite  
a 12% increase  in silage intake. Live-weight  gain of cows,  on the other  
hand,  increased  from 117 (direct  cut) to 330 g/day  (wilted).  This deleter ­
ious partition  of nutrients  from milk into body-weight  change  and hence 
a reduced  gross efficiency  of utilization  of wilted  silage for milk produc ­
tion may be the result  of a reduction  in protein  value on wilting  (Beever, 
1980). Recently,  Gordon  (1980) has shown a trend towards  greater  
responses  in milk yield to protein  supplements  with wilted  compared  to 
direct]  cut silage. The reduction  in efficiency  associated  with wilting  must,  
however,  be balanced  against  positive  managerial  advantages  such as 
reduction  or cessation  of effluent  production  and increased  harvesting  
rate.
55
Additive
The results  of experiments  which have examined  the use of a silage  
additive  on milk yield are shown  in Figure  2. Contrary  to the data on 
wilting,  the use of additive  has resulted  in a relatively  consistent  increase 
in milk production  (+ 1.5 kg milk/day)  mainly  through  an increase  in 
silage intake  rather  than an elevation  in digestibility.  The additive  used 
in the majority  of these trials was formic  acid but where comparisons  
were made of formic  acid and acid/formalin  mixtures  little difference  
between  the two types  of additive  was noted.

Chop  length
Relatively  little data are available  on the effect  of chop length  on milk 
output  but recent  evidence  from the Hannah  Research  Institute  (Castle,  
Retter  and Watson,  1979) suggests  an advantage  to short chopping  (Table  
4).
The cows were given relatively  low levels of concentrate  (2 kg/day)  
and the effect  may be less marked  at higher  concentrate  inputs. Also,  the 
silages  were given in troughs  and it is possible  that the differences  could 
be magnified  if the silages  were self-fed.
Achieving  the potential  of silages
The data presented  have shown that high levels of milk produc ­
tion can be achieved  by cows given silage of high quality.  The potential  
of forage  can be maximised  by feeding  the silage to appetite.  However,  
even if silage is given to appetite  its potential  will be restricted  by the use 
of concentrate.  Thomas  (1980) showed  that an increase  in concentrate  
input results  in a fall in silage intake. A value of ca 0.5 kg fall in silage  
DM/kg  additional  concentrate  DM is commonly  observed.  However,  
with high basal levels of concentrate  and silages  of high digestibility,  
replacement  values  approaching  0.9 have been noted. In these situations  
additional  concentrates  result in only small increases  in total energy 
intake  but a marked  reduction  in the contribution  of silage  energy  to milk 
production.  Thus an effective  conservation  strategy  must be coupled  with 
an appropriate  feeding  policy  if the potential  of high quality  silages  is to 
be exploited.  In particular,  silage must be given to appetite  and offered 
with low levels  of concentrate.
The objective  of the autumn-calving  herd at GRI is to examine  (he 
potential  of silage in a relatively  simple system  in which concentrate  is 
given at a relatively  low level and fed at a flat rate irrespective  of milk

yield. The results  from the herd are compared  in Table 5 with those of 
the top 25% by gross  margin  taken  from MMB/FMS  costed  farms.
The GRI herd has a higher  yield level than the recorded  farms but, 
more importantly,  a markedly  lower input of concentrate.  However,  the 
emphasis  on home grown feed has necessitated  a lower stocking  rate. 
Nevertheless  the results show that good yields can be obtained  with 
relatively  low levels of concentrate  input provided  the potential  of good 
quality  silage is exploited.

Where  are We on Mastitis  Control?
W. J. MEANEY
The Agricultural  Institute,  Moore  park, Co. Cork.
Surveys  on the incidence  of mastitis  in Ireland  in 1963 (1) indicated  that 
47% of the dairy cow population  were infected.  The results  indicated  
that most of the problem  was sub-clinical  and only 6.5% showed  clinical 
symptoms.  These  results  were similar  to those reported  from other  coun ­
tries at that time.
In 1978, a survey  of 831 cows on 26 farms in the Cork liquid milk 
area (2) showed  that 44% of the cows examined  had mastitis. The 
number  of cows infected  on each farm varied from 7% to 90%. The 
predominant  bacteria  were Staphylococci  (72%)  and Streptococci  (22%).
A more recent  survey  (1980)  of 1753 cows on 37 farms  in the Dublin  
liquid milk area (3) showed  that 34% of cows were infected  (herd range  
12.6% to 88%). Again the predominant  pathogens  were Staphylococci  
(65%)  and Streptococci  (17%). When reviewing  these survey  figures,  it 
could be concluded  that mastitis  control  has not been very effective,  
particularly  in some herds. It would appear  worthwhile,  therefore,  to 
examine  the development  and effectiveness  of control  systems.
The control  procedures  developed  and outlined  over the years include,  
milking  machine  maintenance,  milking  hygiene,  teat disinfection,  anti­
biotic  therapy  (in the lactaton  and dry period)  and selective  culling.  These  
procedures  were outlined  mainly  for the prevention  of Staphylococcal  
infections  but had questionable  benefits  in controlling  environmeiital  
bacteria.
With the present  increase  in infections  associated  with environmental  
bacteria  at calving,  the efficacy  of the whole mastitis  control  system  is 
being questioned.  These bacteria  have presented  farmers  with a new set 
of clinical problems  which are associated  with poor winter housing,  
calving facilities,  bedding  arrangements,  overstocking  of yards and 
winter  quarters.  Research  from Moorpark  has shown  that the problem  
is prevalent  in both heifers  and cows and that most of the infections  
develop  between  the onset of springing,  and calving.  The risk continues,  
however,  while animals  remain  indoors.
It is important  at this stage,  to differentiate  between  sub-clinical  infec ­
tions generally  associated  with Staphylococci,  older cows, and machine  
milking,  and clinical  infection  associated  with environmental  contamina ­
tion.
Development  in the control  of Staphylococci
Post-milking  teat disinfection,  now widely  recommended,  reduces  new 
infection  in lactating  cows by 50%. Products  containing  5,000 pmm 
available  iodine, 4.0% available  chlorine  or combined  chlorhexidine
59
(0.16%)  and cetrimide  (0.1%)  were shown  to be effective  in experiments  
at Moorepark.
A new product,  containing  0.3% w/v glutaraldehyde  (Lactasep)  as 
active ingredient  was tested recently  at Moorepark.  The results  showed  
that this formulation  was more effective  than iodine in preventing  new 
infections  (Table  1).
The reduction  in new Staphylococcal  infections  in teats disinfected  
with glutaraldehyde  was significantly  lower  than in those disinfected  with 
iodine (Tabte  2).

The results  for glutaraldehyde  did not show an advantage  over iodine  
in preventing  infections  caused  by environmental  bacteria.
The role of antibiotics  in mastitis  control
Clinical  mastitis  must be identified  and treated promptly.  Correct  
selection  and application  of antibiotics  is essential  to maximise  the 
response.  Five commercial  antibiotic  preparations,  for use in the lactating  
cow, were evaluated  in 129 quarters  infected  with Staphylococcus  atirus.  
The results  are summarised  in Table 3. The cure rates for these prepara ­
tions ranged  from 18% to 53%.
Results  of further  tests on a total of 58 Streptococcal  infections  (Table  
4) showed  responses  ranging  from 42% to 100% (only 3 quarters  treated  
with Nafpenzal).

shown  for Tetra-delta  and Neo-furamast-P  respectively  (Table  5).

The response  to antibiotic  therapy  during  the lactation  is variable  and 
depends  primarily  on; (i) the bacterium;  (ii) the duration  of infection;
(iii) the active  ingredient(s)  and base used and (iv) method  of application.  
The cure rate of Staphylococcal  infections  in these experiments  was par­
ticularly  poor, with wide variations  in responses  between  preparations.  
Response  was based on elimination  of pathogenic  bacteria  together  with 
a reduction  in somatic  cells for a period  of ^28 days after treatment.

Staphylococcal  infections  during  the dry period. Previous  results  from 
Moorepark  showed  cure rates of 80-90%  for infections  treated  at drying  
off. Recent  studies,  however,  show that cure during  the dry p)eriod is 
dependent  on both the antibiotic  preparation  and the duration  of infec ­
tions before  treatment.  The results  presented  in Table  6 show a difference 
of 16% in response  between  Osmonds  DC and Nafpenzal  DC. The re­
sponse  for both these preparations,  however,  was between  33% and 17% 
lower  than for preparations  tested previously  (4, 5).

Environmental  mastitis
Environmental  bacteria  are broadly  classified  as Coliforms,  Strepto ­
cocci and Corynebacterium  pyogenes.  Coliforms  form part of the normal  
animal  gut flora and may be isolated  from soil, water  and damp  litter. A 
variety  of Streptococci  survive  readily  on the coat of cows and also in 
bedding  materials.  Corynebacterium  pyogenes  is widespread  in our en­
vironment  and can be isolated  from open wounds,  abscesses  and some  
purulent  uterine  discharges.  These bacteria  present  a constant  challenge  
to our dairy stock throughout  the winter  housing  period.
Teat disinfectants  and antibiotics  produce  limited  benefits  in preventing  
environmental  infection.  Dependence  on these control  measures  alone  
rnay produce  disappointing  results. The control  of environmental  infec ­
tion requires  special attention  to hygiene  during the dry period and 
particularly  at calving.
Bedding
Comparisons  of clay and concrete  bedding  at Moorepark  showed  that 
infection  levels  were higher  in animals  on concrete.

Discussion
Prevention  IS a fundamental  concept  in mastitis  control,  particularlv  
sm^ est^abhshed  infection  is extremely  difficult  to eliminate.  Teat disin- 
fection  has been one of the most successful  procedures  in the control  of 
infection.  This technique  will be most effective  when 
following  recommended  procedures,  
reduce staphyloccal  colonisation  of the teat orifice  which  prevents  establishment,  and limits  the duration  of infection 
Our ex^riments  show that glutaraldehyde  is a very effective  teat disin 
fectant  for preventing  Staphylococcal  infections.
FameTs  develops,  immediate  treatment  is recommended,
harmers  may be confused,  however,  by the amount  and varietv of 
p eparations  available  and the lack of precise  treatment  instructions  on
64
some packs. Some manufacturers  claim clinical  responses  in excess  of 
80%. However,  in our experiments  on five preparations,  bacteriological  
responses  in staphylococcal  infected  quarters  varied between  18% and 
53%. The best overall  response  was obtained  with Tetra-delta.  When  we 
consider  that Staphylococci  are responsible  for 70-75%  of mastitis  prob ­
lems some of these responses  give serious  cause for concern.  The recent  
trends  in formulating  antibiotics  for short persistence  in the udder  may 
also reduce  cure rates.
The response  to Nafpenzal  was most effective  during  the dry period.  
This supports  previous  studies  which  indicated  that higher  cure rates  were 
achieved  with ‘Dry Cow ’ preparations.  The response  to dry period  
preparations  in recent  experiments  was lower  than for preparations  tested  
previously.  The variation  in response  to lactating  and dry period  anti­
biotics  highlights  the need for efficacy  standards  on all products  on the 
market.
Environmental  infection  is most prevalent  at calving but the risk 
continues  while animals  remain indoors. Bedding  materials  play an 
important  role in the aetiology  of environmental  infection.  The degree  of 
contamination  on beds will depend  on the following  factors  :
(i) the length  of the bed;
(ii) the cleanliness  of the dunging  passages  and yards;
(iii) the stocking  density  in the house.
Our experiments  indicated  that soft bedding  materials  were more  
desirable  for bedding  dairy cows. However,  the addition  of ground  
limestone  to concrete  beds reduced  new infection  levels.
Mastitis  control  must be a programmed  development  in herds over a 
period  of time. Immediate  benefits  will not always  be apparent  but the 
implementation  of a complete  control system will produce  the most  
effective  results. Complete  dependence  on teat disinfectants  and anti­
biotics  without  attending  to the milking  equipment,  dry period  hygiene 
and general  hygiene  during  the lactation  will greatly  reduce  the effective­
ness of control. Studies  are presently  in progress  at Moorepark  to 
investigate  management  and herding  systems  for controlling  infections. 
Additional  research  must also be directed  towards  greater  control  of 
environmental  infections.

Factors  Affecting  the Milk Price  
to the Farmer

Introduction
In order to place the price of milk paid to the
context  and in order  that we may correctly  assess  the effect  ot any otne
influencing  factor  upon it, it is necessary  in the ? degree
the scale of value over which co-operative  managements  have a degree of cTrol This area of control  is inffuenced  by the o/^mary  mteract.on  
of political,  economic,  social and climatic  environments,  each « a greater  
or a lesser  extent 1 wish,  therefore,  to review  the functions  related  to the manlgemeS  of m4 and dairy products  directly  under  my control.  As a 
Doint of clarification.  I should define that milk price is defined  as an STam  gaS milk prie in the case ot bulk refrigerated  milk or a branch  
assembly  point  pticT in the case of milk delivered  to a creamery.
IVlilk ^ssftmblyThe 1970 ’s brought  about  a dramatic  change  in the Irish Dairy Indus ­
try The Common  Agricultural  Policy  has meant  that milk prices  were  
increased  to a level at which  after 3 or 4 years  farmers  enjoyed  a fea^n-  
able standard  of living. For the dairy processing  co-operatives  it was a 
time of rapid amalgamation  and increased  capital  expenditure  to cope wUh theTotoof  milk and to allow greater  diversification.  It was for 
the most part, however,  amalgamation  without  rationalisation.
Over the last few years rationalisation  of milk collection  procedures  
have been undertaken  albeit at a slower  pace than would  be desirabse. 
In the case of Mitchelstown  some 75% of the total milk ^HPoXin^Q7T  
assembled  under  the bulk system  of collection  as against  23 ^ in 1973 
The Dosition  is however,  that in those areas where branches  were still op^raC  atonkde  the newer bulk collection  system,  unit costs of 
Smblv  are effectively  doubled  for that area. Branch  costs are relatively  
fixed so^hat  when some of the throughput  is diverted  to the bulk system  
the total costs of the branch  remain  the same while the costs per gallon  
through  the branch  increase  dramatically.
In Mitchelstown  the net effect is that the price per gallon  of milk is 
nhniit 1D less for all milk than would  be the case if a completely  rational-  S^mik  a sembly  were to apply. The Society  is rapidly  moving
IwayTL  tte hig\ ios, labour  intensive  braneh  system  and js hoM  
that the assembly  structure  will be comp.etely  rationalised  by 1/3/1983.
When  examining  the business  of milk assembly  within  the co-operative  andTS^aSg  it so as to make the most efficient  use of energy  and
66
transport,  the areas of collection  where different  co-operatives  overlap  
should be studied  with a view to further  rationalisation.  Any saving, 
however,  that may arise in this area will be minimal  when looked  as a 
percentage  of total assembly  costs. The volume  of milk involved  in such 
an exercise  is not more than 10% of any co-operative ’s supply  and the 
potential  transport  saving  in moving  this volume  over a shorter  distance  
to an alternative  processing  plant will be far less significant  than is 
generally  believed.
Composition  of miik
When considering  the Irish and other EEC miik returns  we must take 
into account  the relative  yields  and compositions.
In Ireland  for the past number  of years, culling  of the national  herd 
has occurred  mainly  on a disease  basis,  whereas  the rest of the EEC has 
culled on yield. Also, less than 3.0% of Irish cows are milk recorded  
whereas  in Holland  over 62% of herds  are now recorded.  Table 1 shows 
the trends in milk yields, protein  and butterfat  contents  in European  
countries  during  the period 1970-1978.

EEC Dairy Eacts and Figures  1980 MMB
The range of figures  is also revealing.  In Ireland,  for instance,  the 
average  monthly  proteins  will range from 2.8% to 4.3%. In Denmark  
and Holland  the range would be 3.3 to 3.6. Unfortunately,  when the 
solids  content  of Irish milk is high, as for instance  in November,  volumes  
are low and with a butterfat  of 4.8% and a protein  of 4.0%, it is not 
possible  to manufacture  cheese or casein or other non-dried  products.  
The average  butterfat  and protein contents  during the manufacturing  
months of April  to September  would  be 3.4% butterfat  and 3.1% protein.  
The lactose  levels of Irish milk at about 4.4% average  are also much  
lower  than the other  EEC averages  of 4.8% - 5.0%.
An important  factor affecting  milk yield and composition  is mastitis.  
During  the peak milk months  Mitchelstown  measures  the cell count or 
levels of sub-clinical  mastitis  in each supplier ’s milk. The result is re­
67
ported  with the monthly  milk statement  and an estimate  is made of the
potential  loss attributable  to that supplier.  • j ,A survey  of the results  of 900 Mitchelstown  milk suppliers  carried  out 
by our staff highlighted  the effect of mastitis  on milk yields.

Table 2 clearly  indicates  the loss that herdowners  are experiencing  in
the various  cell count  categories.  t n o o/The average  gallon of Irish milk has a total solids  content  ot 12. jo 
whereas  in the other dairying  countries  such as Denmark  and Holland  
the average  gallon  would  contain  13.5% solids. ...
To see the effect  of this, let us take the relative  costs of drying  one ton 
of skim milk powder  in Holland  and Ireland.  Because  of the lower  con­
tents of solids in Ireland,  nearly 2200 lb of additional  water has to be 
evaporated  per tonne as against  Holland,  with a consequent  increase  in 
energy costs. The added labour  cost, assembly  cost and reduction  in 
plant  throughput  consequent  upon this factor  are also quite signincant.
In discussing  the factors  affecting  the farmer ’s milk price the butterfat  
factor  must be considered  and I wish to comment  on the butterfat  testing 
practices.  The Dairy  Produce  Act 1924 specifies  quite clearly  what one 
may or may not do. This Act was introduced  to protect  the interest  ot 
the milk supplier  and a co-operative  may not deviate  from the require ­
ments of that Act. I am satisfied  that the controls  and practices  in 
operation  at Mitchelstown  are correct.  Also,  there is available  within  the 
Dairy Produce  Act a facility  whereby  any supplier  who so wishes  can 
have his composite  samples  check-tested  by the Dairy Produce  Insj^ctor  
provided  he applies  in writing  to the Department  of Agriculture  and pays 
a fee of £2. This is a totally  confidential  service  available  to the supplier. 
The Creamery  is never aware of a request  having  been made. The sup­
plier is notified  by the Department  of the Inspector ’s result.
Seasonality
A product  mix set out in the context  of an annual  production  prog ­
ramme  must recognise  the seasonality  factors  that will affect  production.
Further  costs are incurred  through  the fixed capital  requirements  ot a 
diary processor.  A study carried  out by the Dairy Industry  Technical  
Study Group  under  the chairmanship  of Mr. Michael  Lovett  shows  the
68
average  plant utilisation  of dairy plants  throughout  Europe.  Bearing  in 
mind that capital cost can only be justified  when based on minimum  
payback  periods  of 2-3 years because  of high interest  costs and technical  
developments,  we can easily see the effect of £1 million  amortised  over 
say, 80 million  gallons  of milk intake as being up to 0.42 p/gal. In 
Mitchelstown ’s case the reinstatement  value of plant will demand  a re­
investment  level of £3 million  per annum  at 1981 values,  before added  
milk or technical  development.
Manpower  levels
A further  difficulty  arises in matching  manpower  operating  levels to 
changes  in the milk supply  pattern  and it has been quantified  that up to 
36% of total dairy wages are fixed in the manufacture  of commoditv  
products  (Keane,  1980).
Market  opportunities  and intelligence  should determine  the mix of 
products  a co-operative  chooses  to manufacture  and, generally  speaking,  
these will be ranked  in order  of preference,  dependent  upon the contribu ­
tion that the milk content  of the product  will make to the fixed costs of 
the business.
We, in the past, have committed  ourselves  to markets  which for a 
period of time did not yield an adequate  return in the context  of the 
alternatives  available.  It is not possible  to say whether  in the event that 
this situation  were to arise again,  we would similarly  commit  ourselves,  
esjjecially  in the long term. In my view the present  margins  available  to 
us, having  offered  the price we have offered  in the current  year for milk,  
would  not allow us to tolerate  any loss-making  operation.  Anything  that 
prejudices  our return  to the farmer  through  a net loss causes  us to borrow  
money to pay for milk. This has the immediate  effect of creating  a 
burden  on future milk supplies— a factor that no Board of Directors  
representing  farmers  and the interest  of their society  should tolerate.  
These factors  reflected  in a dairy processing  society  are principally  :—
1. Finance  and storage  for working  capital,
2. Investment  for peak capaeity,
3. Other operating  expenses  with a fixed oontent,  which are reflected  
throughout  the business  from assembly  through  to market  returns.
Diversification
The interaction  of supply,  demand  and price for differing  dairy pro­
ducts in different  markets  at different  times also presents  opportunities.  
The requirement  to have adequate  processing  and labour  facilities  to 
optimise  on such market  changes  is important,  The cost of such facilities,  
which  may not be used on a regular  basis, has an influence  on the level 
of investment  required,  together  with its attendant  cost.
In theory, the advantage  from manufacturing  a particular  product  
should  more than cancel  out the extra  cost involved.  There  are, however,  
some products  which we are precluded  from making  because  of the 
eonstraints  imposed  by seasonality.  These are often compounded  further  
because  of the distance  of Ireland  from the market  place.
69
Our major products  are principally  confined  to milk {xjwders,  butter  
and hard cheeses —short shelf life products  of which there are many on 
the Continent  and which  are good income  earners  are not technologically  
possible  because  of seasonality.
In 1980 over 80% of total manufacturing  milk was processed  into 
butter,  skim milk powder  and cheese. Butter  oil and whole  milk powder  
account  for a further  15%.
Labour  costs
Excluding  raw materials,  the cost of labour  amounts  to almost  43% 
of the total remaining  costs in our dairying  operation.  It is a matter  for 
regret that the dairy industry  is not represented  directly  at National  
Understanding  discussions  and our influence,  therefores  on wage rates  
and the final form of any agreement  is minimal.
The burden  of Employers ’ Pay-Related  Social  Insurance  surcharge  also 
continues  to rise and there is merit in the CII suggestion  that this cost 
should  be reduced  from the present  level of 10% to 3% (Confederation  
of Irish Industry  1981). Also,  with such a vital content  in the total value 
added  there is no doubt  that good labour  relations  will have a significant 
effect on the overall  survival  and growth  of the industry.
Energy  costs
Energy  costs have increased  drastically  over the last number  of years. 
The Society  energy  bill now exceeds  £3 million  and is increasing  at an 
accelerating  rate. The main influences  are ;
1. Increased  prices  by producer  countries.
2. Currency  surcharges.
3. Government  tax and Irish inflation.
The fall of the Irish Punt, while not affording  any advantage  in the 
export  of dairy products  to the EEC countries,  is certainly  making  our 
energy  requirements  more and more expensive.  The Duty levied by the 
Government  on fuel oils will cost our Society  nearly  £600,000  in 1981.  
Again,  the Confederation  of Irish Industries  has made recommendations  
to the Government  regarding  this tax.
The Society  at the moment  is also considering  the question  of energy 
usage and a study of alternative  cheaper  forms  of energy  has been com­
pleted. Decisions  are now being taken which we are confident  will go 
some of the way towards  offsetting  the increasing  burden  of energy  costs 
on dairy processing.  People  and energy  costs account  for over 60% of all 
value added in dairy processing. • j u .Continued  monitoring  against  standard  and predetermined  budgets,  
together  with ongoing  comparison  of alternative  energy sources,  is a 
further  important  factor  in offsetting  rising  costs. Indeed,  a 10% volume 
saving  in energy  usage  or labour  hours  would  represent  a major  achieve- 
ment  for Mitchelstown  Management,  whereas  a 20% + inflation  index  for 
each of these items is commonplace.  ,
Remaining  cost items,  especially  maintenance  costs, can be treated  in 
the same context  as labour  and capital expenditure  whilst packaging
70
materials  are, largely  speaking,  hydrocarbon  based and tend to increase  
at similar  rates though  somewhat  later than oil price increases.
The view, therefore,  relating  to these items is that they will continue  
to increase  in cost and that they do absorb  a material  proportion  of the 
margin  between  value of finished  products  and milk price.
Cash  flow
Cash flow is the first demand  on the price of milk. It is the vehicle  that 
sustains  and develops  the fabric of the Society  to allow the Society  to 
honour  its commitment  to its shareholders.
An adequate  level of cash flow is necessary  to justify  the confidence 
that lending  institutions  and creditors  have placed  in the business —for 
each £3 invested  in our Society  £2 comes  from sources  other  than owners  
funds and a cash flow must be of a level adequate  to justify  this com­
mitment.
Marketing
Economic  and geographic  circumstances  have created  additional  dis­
advantages  for sellers  of Irish dairy  products  on the international  markets.  
In the first instance,  our National  inflation  rate and wage cost increases  
have for a number  of years  substantially  exceeded  Brussels ’ declared  pro­
duct price increases.  The effect of this, as already  stated,  has been to 
reduce  the gross margin  available  to cover  processing  costs.
Secondly,  distance  from our market  places  an additional  burden  upon  
us in terms  of shipment  costs. These  factors  are further  compounded  by 
our seasonality  of production —a topic which  has been already  covered. 
Together,  they now offset,  to an extent,  what was often referred  to as our 
distinct  climatic  advantages  as a milk producing  country.
With C.A.P.  we have an intervention  price structure  which  guarantees  
a minimum  return on, skim powder  and butter. This effectively  sets the 
minimum  price at which  milk may be incorporated  into other producas.
The interaction  of production  and demand  will determine  the ultimate  
price to be achieved  for such other diversified  products.
We regard  the foregoing  cost elements  as the principal  factors  within  
our scope  of activity  affecting  the price of milk to the farmer.
We see some prospects  for additional  cost savings,  principally  in milk 
assembly  and the overall  vigilance  of management  in relation  to operating  
expense.  Also, to some extent  these other costs will be contained  by the 
emerging  new technologies.
Seasonality  of supply in all it implies,  including  capital investment,  
product  mix, added working  capital  and productivity  of labour  among  
other things,  remains  with us and we expect,  because  of the advantage  
that farmers  enjoy as producers  of milk largely  from grass, that it will 
continue  to dominate  our cost structure.
Whereas  it is not directly  within  the scope of this paper,  it would  be 
quite incorrect  to ignore  the other areas related  to the value of milk that 
may have an effect  on its value to the farmer.
71
Inside  the farm gate
It is necessary  to point out as other authors  have done recently  (Raf-  
tery 1981; Walsh,  1981) that the greatest  scope for improving  income 
from milk is still under  the direct  control  of the farmer  himself.  Actual  
output  per cow is far less than that which  the experts  say is achievable.  
With good grassland  and dairy  herd management an extra 100 gallons  per 
cow would  add approximately  7 p/gal on all milk produced.
In an effort  to instil confidence  and improve  incomes,  the Mitchelstown  
Society  pioneered  a cheap  loan scheme  for cow purchase.  A loan interest  
subsidy  is being  provided  by the Society  which  effectively  means  that the 
rate of interest  paid by the farmer  is fixed at 10%. This scheme  is self 
liquidating  for the farmer  in that the income  from the extra cows will 
more than repay principal  and interest  even in the first year. It is to be 
hoped that further  schemes  such as this will be introduced  to stimulate  
investment  and greater  output,  and restore  confidence.
Conclusion
From the foregoing  analysis  it is clear that the potential  for improved 
efficiency  in the combined  areas of assembly,  processing  and market ­
ing, will not have as great an impact  on milk prices  as the potential  still 
remaining  within  the farm gate itself.

Managing  Farm Finances  in a Recession
P. MAHON
A.C.O.T.,  At  henry,  Co. Galway.
During  the 1970 ’s there was an unprecedented  rise in prices  for the main  
agricultural  commodities  and as a result,  agricultural  incomes  rose sub­
stantially.  Prices,  however,  plateaued  in 1978 and cash surpluses  were  
difficult  to generate  in 1979 and again during  1980. While the essential 
problems  that caused  the recessnon  were stagnating  prices and cost in­
flation,  a series  of other coincidences  compounded  their worst effects,  as 
follows :
In 1979
(i) Poor grass  growth  in spring  resulted  in an increased  usage  of meals,  
e.g. lb meals fed/gallon  of milk produced  increased  from 1.53 in 
1978 to 1.76 in 1979 for a 700 gallon  cow.
(ii) Substantial  fall in cattle prices  in autumn,  
fiii) Acceleration  of disease  eradication  measures.
(iv) Harvest  losses.
In 1980
(i) Significant  reductions  in butterfat  levels  in milk, and calf prices.
(ii) Hay losses  during  the summer.
(iii) Harvest  losses.
These developments  also coincided  with restrictions  on credit as a 
result  of Central  Bank  guidelines  in the early part of 1979. However,  by 
this stage many farmers ’ total borrowings  had exceeded  the limit which 
they could reasonably expect  to service  even in the long term. Meanwhile  
interest  rates reached  record levels and the Increase  in debt of farmers  
who had overborrowed  accelerated  once they became  affected  by the 
factors  mentioned  above. Table 1 illustrates  the increase  in loan repay ­
ments  arising  from higher  interest  rates.
Table 1
Loan repayment  on £40,000
Term November  1977 June 1980
5 year £10,000 £12,000
10 year £6,000 £9,000
15 year £5,000 £8,120
However,  most of these adverse  conditions  could have been overcome 
by the majority  of farmers  now in financial  difficulty  had product  prices 
maintained  their 1978 relative  value.
Overall,  therefore,  while farm incomes  dropped  by about 40% in 
money  terms between  1978 and 1980, the consequences  on individual
74
farmers  has varied enormously.  In general,  all farmers  experienced  a 
drop in income  from the 1978 peak. In the case of those farms  which  
were being developed  in the early 70’s, the fall in income  resulted  in a 
greatly  reduced  cash surplus  for saving and investment.  However,  for 
those who had begun to develop  in the late 70’s the recession  was 
catastrophic,  resulting  in rapidly  accumulating  loan commitments.  Thus,  
at this point in time many farmers  are overborrowed  to the extent  that 
only asset disposal  or massive  concessions  in interest  rates or increase  in 
product  prices,  will enable  them to survive.
The problem  of managing  finances,  therefore,  takes on a different  
meaning  and importance  depending  on which  group  is being  considered.  
Whi ’e most of our effort and concern  must be for those farmers  who 
cannot meet loan commitments  or reasonable  living expenses  there is 
also some general  advice  which can apply to all groups. The proper  or 
prudent  management  of farm finances  is always  important,  recession  or 
not, if one is concerned  with increasing  income  and long term viability.
Fanners  in severe  financial  difficu'ties
The problems  being experienced  by these farmers  originated  during  
the ‘good ’ times of 1977/78.  Many of them were virtually  debt free up 
to ateut 1977 and took the decision  to expand  or modernise  their farms,  
when they began to generate  cash surpluses  maybe for the first time. 
The majority  were developing  dairy enterprises  and in many cases com­
plete new facilities  were required.
Many  of th financial  plans  were marginal,  even with 1978 margins  and 
success  depended  on achieving  a high level of efficiency.  In many cases 
these farmers  have now fully completed  their building  programme  with 
perhaps  only 75% of their stock targets achieved.  Efficiency  actually  
dropped  on these farms during  the first few years of development.  This 
resulted  in losses  and a subsequent  increase  in borrowings.  Some  farmers  
can trace their present  difficulties  to excessive  building  or land reclama ­
tion costs. The total debt continued  to build up almost  un-noticed  so 
that many farmers  now have borrowings  of between  £700-£1,200  per 
cow. The problem  of split financing,  i.e. money from many sources, 
contributed  in no small way to this debt. All agencies  seemed  willing  to 
lend without  adequate  study of the full facts. The farmer  was solving 
his imediate  cash problem  by borrowing  from a new source.
Whatever  the reasons  for past mistakes  these farmers  are in financial  
difficulty  to varying  degrees  and must take action  to improve  the situation.  
They should  seek assistance,  give all available  information,  undertake  a 
complete  review of their present  financial  position  and their prospects  
for the next couple  of years.
PossibUities  available
(1) The most immediate  and satisfactory  method  of easing  the present  
problem  is by restructuring  of loans. Many of the cases can be solved, 
at least in the short-term,  by that simple  expedient  which the lending  
institutions  will grant  without  much  difficulty.  In certain  cases,  the impact  
can be dramatic  as shown  in Table 2.

(2) Improve  efficiency
An immediate  problem  on most farms,  particularly  those in financial 
difficulties,  is to improve  efficiency.  In many  cases efficiency  has suffered  
on those  farms  over the past few years  due to pressures  of various  kinds. 
The very fact that development  is going  on means  that the farmer  cannot  
devote  his full time to managing  the enterprises  and where he attempts  
to reduce investment  costs by using own or direct labour,  the general  
level of efficiency  can drop seriously.  In one recorded  case, yield per cow 
dropped  from 750 gallons  in 1977/78  to 500 gallons  in 1979 and 1980.  
The potential  for improving  yield and general  efficiency  is enormous  on 
many farms. However,  it may require  2-3 years to improve  efficiency  
sufficiently  to meet commitments  so a moratorium  on principal  may be 
necessary  for some time.
Many farmers  who are presently  experiencing  difficulty  in meeting  
repayments  can alleviate  their problem  by improved  yields.  This improve ­
76
ment can be initiated  on all farms immediately.  Simple management  
control  systems  can be set up if necessary  on these farms to monitor  
progress  and control  performance.
(3) Increase  size of enterprise
On many farms in financial  difficulty,  especially  dairy farms,  the live­
stock targets  have not been achieved.  Indeed  some have only 50-70%  of 
their potential  or planned  numbers  even though  buildings  and facilities  
are completed.  For those farmers,  expansion  to their original  targets  is 
essential  especially  where  tillage is not an option.
(4) Sale of assets  — land
In some cases where the farmer  is totally  over committed  (£1,000  -I- 
per cow), no restructuring  or long term improvements  will solve the 
problem.  As the situation  continues  to worsen  the debt accumulates  and 
over 5-6 years the original  debt could be doubled.  In such a case the 
options  are very limited  and the disposal  of some assets to reduce  debt 
must be considered.  The sale of sites is the easiest  way of reducing  com­
mitments  and still maintaining  the full potential  of the farm. Where  the 
sale of sites is not possible  or sufficient  to solve the problem  then the sale 
of some land must be considered.  Where  an outfarm  or small section  of 
land can be sold without  affecting  the long term viability  of the farm then 
this course  of action must be considered.  Farmers  who purchased  land 
in 1977/78  and are now £1,500  or more per acre in debt may have no 
option  but to sell part of the purchased  land. Of course  the sale of land 
would  only be considered  after all other courses  of action  are exhausted.
(5) Sale of livestock  and substitution  with tillage
Some farmers  are being advised  to sell livestock  even where tillage is 
not an alternative,  to reduce  their commitments.  This “advice ” is short ­
sighted  and dangerous  as in most cases the remaining  debt is still much  
too large for the new situation.  The possibility  of selling  off low yielders  
and substituting  with tillage,  using contractors  for all operations  would 
be of some advantage  provided  that :
(i) tillage  yields  are high;
(ii) no extra machinery  is purchased.  However,  the tillage alternative  
must be treated  with caution  as it can lead to large investment  in 
machinery,  and very often yield does not reach expectations.
(6) Moratorium  of interest
At present  some lending  institutions  are deferring  interest  payments  
for a year or so in the hope that conditions  will improve.  This concession 
is useful  to farmers who have to make  further  expansion  in stock  numbers  
and/or  have potential  for greater  efficiency  as it gives them more time 
to consolidate  their enterprises.  However,  the farmer should satisfy 
himself  that this deferral  of interest  will in fact give him a better  chance  
for success,  as many farmers  may find themselves  with greatly  increased  
debts  and no capacity  to meet repayments.  If asset disposal  is necessary,  
it is better  to know immediately  and be prepared  to avail of opportunities
77
for high sale prices,  than in later years  when good chances  may have been 
missed.
Cash flow budgets  give a reasonable  indication  of current  finances.
(7) New investments
New investments  in buildings,  equipment,  land reclamation,  etc. should 
be considered  with great caution  and in some cases should  not be made.
In cases of severe  financial  difficulties,  investment  in fixed assets  must  
be minimal  and only for absolutely  essential  items which give a quick  
return. The cost of the investment  must be rigidly  controlled  and kept 
within  the budget.
For young farmers  with small to medium  size farms with a lot of 
development  potential,  productive  investment  must come  first. Investment  
in modern  expensive  buildings  and equipment  must be postponed  until 
stock numbers  are increased  and their management  has reached  accept ­
able levels. A high level of commitment  should not be confused  with 
management  ability. These farmers  must first prove their ability  (espec­
ially to themselves)  and work with cheap  functional  buildings  until mat­
ters improve  financially.
For those farmers  who have achieved  high levels  of management  and 
have small borrowings,  a recession  is probably  the ideal time to take 
advantage  of their relatively  strong  position  in the market  to modernise  
and install  facitities.  In all cases,  however,  the advisor  should  be consulted  
and a realistic  farm plan with cash flow or annual  budgets  prepared.
Lessons  to be learned  by developing  farmers
From the events  of the last few years  there are a number  of lessons  to 
be learned,  especially  by farmers  about  to commence  development :—
(1) Agriculture  is a cyclical  industry  and the “good ” year should be 
treated  as compensation  for the “bad” year in the past or future.  
Plans  or budgets  should  therefore  be prepared  on long term realistic  
prospects  for the enterprise.
(2) Where  borrowed  money is likely to be required,  a financial  plan 
should  always  be prepared.
(3) When  incomes  are high the term of loan could be shortened  so that 
there is flexibility  to restructure  if incomes  fall.
(4) Beware  of using current  cast flow surpluses  for financing  major  in­
vestments,  only seeking  loan facilities  when spare cash runs out. 
Very often repayment  capacity  does not exist.
(5) Keep within  budgets  and loan approvals.  Many  farmers  currently  in 
trouble  greatly  exceeded  their original  budgets.  Use the farm plan,  
physical  and financial,  as a reference  document  to guide and control  
development.  Wrongly,  the plan or cash flow is often discarded  once 
loans are approved.
(6) Beware  of Hire Purchase  as they are too expensive  and too rigid 
when income  falls.
(7) If overdrafts  for working  capital  cannot  be paid off within  the year,  
recognise  this as a problem,  not to be concealed  by applying  to 
another  agency  for finances  to keep the operation  working.
(8) Know  the minimum  efficiency  targets  which  are required  for success.
78
If targets  must be high then set up a recording  system  to monitor  and 
conrrol  the important  factors  which determine  yield, efficiency,  etc. 
In general,  farm management  accounts  have often been abused  and 
ignored.
(9) Arrange  loan repayments  to suit expected  cash flow surpluses.
Management  of current  finances
After discussing  the structural  aspects  of managing  farm finances,  let 
us now examine  the more immediate  problems  which  every farmer  con­
siders in a recession.  Again,  the pressure  to take action  will vary with 
the different  types of financial  problems.
When incomes  fall and living costs increase,  the most immediate  re­
action  is to reduce  costs. This can vary from the elimination  of waste to 
a drastic  cut back in vital direct  inputs,  fertiliser,  feed,  etc. How can the 
farmer  reduce  his costs and at the same time maintain  his production  
and increase  income  ?
1. Overeihad  costs
There are a number  of overhead  costs which can be investigated.  
Machinery  running  costs  should  be examined  in particular.  Many  farmers,  
accustomed  to buying  diesel at lOp per gallon  have not adjusted  to the 
fact that it now costs over 84p. Many unnecessary  journeys  are made  
each day on nearly  all farms  canning  small loads  or merely  as a means  
of transport.  In operating  machinery  for essential  operations,  Table 3 
demonstrates  significant  potential  for saving  in fuel costs for the heavier  
power  consuming  operations.

The following  steps can be taken to reduce  the above  costs
79
(i) Set out the injectors  and check  fuel injection  pump  output  every  two 
years (cost £20 - £30).
Set up machines  correctly.
Sharpen  the cutterhead  on precision  chops  twice daily  
Sharpen  all knives  and flails properly  on forage  harvesters.  Sharpen  
the cutterhead  on precision  chops  twice daily.
Place wheel  weights  on \vhen ploughing  and remove  when tilling.  
Use a small horsepower  tractor  for yard work and use a high horse ­
power  tractor  for the large machines.  It is not unusual  to find large  
tractors  on grassland  farms  even though  contractors  are employed 
for sialge making,  etc.
Repair  all leaks.
Similarly,  car and electricity  expenses  which  cost a minimum  of £1000  
cash per year even on small farms  can be curtailed.
In the relatively  simple  area of milking  machine  washing.  Table  4 shows  
that savings  up to £350 in electricity  costs are possible  by switching  from 
boiling  to cold circulation  cleaning.(ii)

Cold circulation 24p 72 40 120
Acid/boiling  water 96p 288 160 480
Finally,  maintenance  or miscellaneous  fixed costs should  be examined.  
Many  hundreds  of pounds  can be spent  annually  in beautifying  and main ­
taining  the farm, e.g. extra concrete,  new fencing,  gates, etc. Some of 
these items can be postponed  for a few years without  unduly  affecting 
farm performance.
(2) Living  expenses
In times of severe financial  difficulties  living expenses  must be kept 
under control. While excessive  living costs are only a problem  in a 
minority  of cases there is still scope for savings  on some farms  without  
causing  hardship.  In a farm situation  it can be difficult  to control  living 
costs. Thus,  it is advisable  to open a separate  household  account  to which  
regular  agreed  transfers  can be made. This makes  control  and budgeting  
easier.
(3) Savings  on variable  or direct  costs
It is much more difficult  to reduce  costs in this area without  seriously 
affecting  yield or general  efficiency.  The aim here must be to cut expen ­
sive inputs  by direct  substitution  with cheaper  products.  For example,  in 
calf rearing  many farmers  feed all whole milk for the first two months.

Substantial  savings  can be made by using milk replacer  instead  of whole  
milk and by weaning  on to concentrates  and hay at a younger  age. 
Savings  of between  £6 to £20 per calf  are possible  on many  farms.
The other items which should  be examined  are meal inputs  and fer­
tiliser applications.  In general,  rate of fertiliser  application  seems  to h« 
somewhat  below recommended  levels at various  stocking  rates. This 
results  in an increase  in meal inputs  to substitute  for grass. Moorepark  
results  have shown that for every pound of nitrogen  applied  for early  
grass, dry matter  production  is increased  by 9-15 lb or up to 150 lb 
fresh grass. Depending  on the economics  of the day substituting  urea for 
CAN can reduce  costs  without  reducing nutrient  input. In most grassland  
situations  it should  be possible  to use 50% of total nitrogen  required  in 
the form of urea.
Good grassland  farmers  and managers  can achieve  800-900  gals of 
milk per cow with under 1.0 lb meal per gallon. However,  the average 
ia about 1.5 lb/gal. The difference  amounts  to 4 bags per cow valued  at 
£30 per cow.
On a general  basis the cost of finance  can be trimmed  by avoiding  too 
much  Co-op  or merchant  credit.  Some  agencies  charge  up to  2^% interest  
p)er month  which is well over 30% for the year. Whilst  it is attractive  
to buy now and pay later, the loss of a 5% discount  and paying  even 
4% per month  for 6 months  is equivalent  to a yearly  interest  charge  of 
over 28%. If possible,  finances  should  be arranged  so that all working  
capital  requirements  are financed  on overdraft.  This overdraft  should  be 
paid off within  the year if possible,  in order to avail of lower interest  
rates.
Where  finances  are extremely  limited  and where the control  of input  
costs is a problem,  a monthly  or quarterly  cash flow budget  should  be 
prepared  and used monthly  or quarterly  to monitor  and control  perform ­
ance. Adequate  management  accounts  are also essential  but often seem  
to be ignored.
Whilst  there is professional  help and advice  available  to farmers  with 
financial  problems,  it is the job of the farmer  to farm and change  matters.  
Waiting  for outside  help or price rises can be a costly  exercise  especially  
when  there is so much scope for improvement  on many  farms.

A Technical  Economic  Comparison  
Between  French,  British  and Dutch  
Dairy Farms
G. J. WISSELING
Agricultural  Economics  Research  Institute,  Lelystad,  Netherlands.
In November  1978 in Versailles  a meeting  was held on the question  : 
What is the relative  farm economic  position  of dairy farmers  in France,  
the United  Kingdom  and the Netherlands.  This meeting  was organised  
by “I’Association  Frangaise  pour la Production  Fourragere ”. The Asso ­
ciation  had invited  an English,  a French  and a Dutch  research  worker  to 
present  data on dairy  farms  from  their own countries.  During  the previous  
provisional  meeting  agreement  was reached  about  a uniform  presentation.  
Moreover,  it was decided  to give a detailed  picture  of a few dairy farms  
instead  of an overall  picture  of the average  situation  in the whole  country.  
There is a very wide variation  from farm to farm and from area to area.  
The average  does not give a good idea of the potential  possibilities  and 
the data are not suitable  for a deeper  technical  analysis.  Therefore  pre­
ference  was given to choosing  two or three dairy farms  which could be 
eonsidered  to be representative  of the top third of the total number  of 
farms in an important  dairy area in the different  countries.  Criteria  for 
this were income  and milk production  per cow. Finally  a comparison  was 
made between  3 French (Brittany,  Normandy,  Lorraine),  2 English  
(Shropshire,  Etorset)  and 2 Dutch farms (N. Brabant,  Utrecht).  In the 
scope  of this article  the presentation  of the figures  will be restricted  to one 
farm from each country.
The farm plans
On the French  farm wheat  and barley  are grown  (Table  1) and fodder  
production  is varied. Besides  grassland,  kale and fodder  maize play a 
role. The English  farm is the largest  and in keeping  with the total picture  
in this country.  The French  farm keeps a rather  small herd in a stan­
chion barn. The bam has been modernised  and a milk tank is available.  
On the English  and the Dutch  farms  the cows are kept in a cubicle  house. 
On the French  and the English  farm there is a large herd of young  stock 
while on the Dutch  farm replacements  are minimal.
The English  farm has some hired labour,  the other  two are pure family 
farms.
Technical  productivity
Labour  productivity  is lowest on the French farm, even when the 
cereals  are taken in account  (Table  2). Between  the other  two farms,  the 
difference  is not large.

Land use is vxery intensive  in the Dutch farm. Stocking  rate and 
nitrogen  use are highest,  resulting  in the highest  net SE production  per 
acre. Due to the very high stocking  rate, production  from the farm itself 
is not sufficient  and much feed stuff must be purchased.  This is mainly  
concentrate  but also roughage  is bought.  Home  produced  fodder  on the 
Dutch  farm is only 57% of the total fodder  consumed,  whilst  on the other  
farms  it is respectively  88% and 74%. The high proportion  of purchased  
fodders  is typical for the Dutch dairy industry.  The shortage  of land 
brought  the Dutch dairy farmers  first to an intensive  use of their own 
grassland  and further  in connection  with a relatively  favourable  ratio of 
milk price and concentrate  price, to a high level of purchased  fodders.  
The English  farm occupies  a middle  position.
Milk production  per cow is relatively  high in each farm. The good 
production  on the French  farm is striking  in relation  to the low concen ­
trate level.
Price  ratios
Table 3 gives some prices of products  and production  inputs  in the 
different  countries.  These are general  price data of the regions  and not 
the actual prices of the three farms. In the Netherlands  we find a 
relatively  high milk price and a favourable  milk price —concentrate  price  
ratio. However,  wages, prices of machinery  and land prices are very 
high. In the United Kingdom,  milk price is lowest  and the prices of 
calves  and cull cows are very low.

Financial  results
Technical  data and price ratios  together give the financial  results.  Table  
4 gives the calculation  of the net profit. The labour  of the farmer  and 
his family  has been taken into account  in calculating  costs. Interest  on 
the total investments  (the farmer ’s own money + borrowed  money)  in 
cattle,  machinery  and buildings  has been calculated  at 8%. The costs for 
the land have been worked  out on a rent basis.

Net profit from the Dutch farm is highest.  Compared  with the other  
farms  the total production  is raised to a high level by intensive  land use 
(nitrogen),  purchases  of concentrates  and roughages  and a high milk 
production  per cow. This, in the Dutch  price situation,  has led to a high 
gross margin  per acre and per farm. The gross margin/acre  was £573  
compared  with £206 on the French  and £184 on the English  farm. A 
high gross  margin  was combined  with a high labour  productivity.  In spite
86
of the high labour  productivity  (59 L.U./FEL),  labour  costs are high 
because  wages  are very high. Together  with high costs of contract-work  
machinery  and buildings  this makes  the sum of these costs very high. Per 
L.U. this sum is £308 on the Duteh  farm and on the Freneh  and English  
farms  it is respeetively  £297 and £159.
Compared  with the French  farm, the Dutch farm achieved  its better  
result by means  of its better structural  and technical  performance.  An 
analysis  of price and technical  influences  showed  that the French  price 
climate  as a whole  was a little more favourable  for milk production  than 
the Dutch. The English  farm had a lower result than the Dutch both 
because  of a slightly  lower technical  level and a less favourable  price 
climate.  In particular  low cattle prices  play a role.
Finally  it must  be stated  that the Dutch  farmers  in their price situation  
(high wages  and high costs of land together  with other high prices)  are 
forced into very intensive  farming.  This situation  is very vulnerable  to 
changes  in the prices  of concentrates,  nitrogen  and fuel. In these times  
of increasing  energy  prices,  this situation  is not without  its dangers.

ABSTRACTS
THE EFFECT  OF LEVEL  OF SOIL CONTAMINATION  ON 
MACHINE-WASHED  HERBAGE  SAMPLES
G. B. NICOLL
The Agricultural  Institute,  Grange,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
The effect of machine-washing  herbage  samples  contaminated  with 
known  levels  of soil was evaluated.  Soil contamination  levels  were 0, 10 
or 20 g of dry soil per 100 g of green herbage.  Within  each soil level 
samples  were either not washed,  or washed  for 2 or 4 minutes.  All 
samples  were dried,  ground  and analysed  for ash and in vitro dry matter  
digestibility  (DMD)  and organic  matter  digestibility  (OMD).
The dry matter (DM) content  of unwashed  material  was positively 
(P<0.001)  related  to the level of soil contamination,  whereas  that of 
washed  herbage  was negatively  (P<0.001))  related. The DM content  of 
uncontaminated  herbage  was not influenced  by washing,  but when con­
taminated,  the DM content  of unwashed  material  was significantly  greater  
than that of washed  material.  Duration  of washing  was only significant 
at the 20 per cent  level of soil contamination.  In unwashed  material,  there  
was a si^ificant  decline  in the organic  matter  (OM) content,  and an 
increase  in the ash content,  as soil level increased,  but the OM and ash 
contents  of washed  herbage  were similar  for all soil levels. The OM and 
ash contents  of uncontaminated  herbage  were not affected  by washing, 
however  at the 10 and 20 per cent soil levels,  washed  herbage  had sig- 
nificaitly  greater  OM and less ash contents  than unwashed  herbage.
The DMD  coefficients  of unwashed  samples  decreased  (P<0.001)  with 
increasing  soil level, but were equivalent  in washed  samples  for all levels  
of soil contamination.  Similar  results were apparent  for the OMD  
coefficients.
Washing  resulted  in important  losses of herbage  DM, predominantly  
digestible  DM and organic  in nature,  only when the material  was con­
taminated.  These losses increased  with increasing  level of soil contam ­
ination.
It was concluded  that the machine  washing  of herbage  samples  was 
effective  in eliminating  soil contamination  without  affecting  herbage  
in vitro.

EFFECT  OF SWARD  COMPOSITION  ON PRODUCTION
G. KEANE  and G. DOHERTY  
Lyons  Estate,  University  College,  Dublin.
A number  of trials have been carried  out over the past few years to 
examine  the effect of sward composition  on production.
Sward dry matter  yields in the first two years of a new ley were not 
affected  as the meadowgrass  component  of the seeds mixture  increased  
to 40% by weight. Animal  production  under  grazing  was similar  from  
swards  containing  high (over 40%) and low (less than 20%) levels of 
perennial  ryegrass.
Total  dry matter  yields  were not affected  by using  mixtures  of perennial  
ryegrass  varieties  rather  than one variety.  However,  there were differences 
in seasonal  production  from the different  mixtures.  Increasing  the Italian  
component  of the seeds mixture  from 0 to 33i% by weight  tended to 
increase  dry matter  yields  in the first two years of the ley.
THE  EFFECT  OF WILTING  ON THE EFFICIENCY  WITH  WHICH  
SILAGE  DRY  MATTER  IS USED  FOR  BEEF  PRODUCTION

Three  groups  of Hereford  X Friesian  steers  (10 per group-initial  weight 
464 kg) were fed direct  cut silage (22.7%  DM, pH 3.89),  medium  wilted 
silage (31.3%  DM, pH 4.48) and heavily  wilted silage (39.7%  DM, pH 
4.69) for 119 days. A fourth  group  of animals  was slaughtered  to estimate  
initial carcase  weight  and composition.
Grass was harvested  from a mainly  perennial  ryegrass  sward with a 
precision  chop harvester  on May 22-26, 1980. All grass was of high 
quality  and was treated  with 2.3 1/tonne  of 85% formic  acid.
Animals  were individually  fed silage ad libitum. Average  daily DM 
(toluene)  intakes  were 8.99 kg, 8.63 kg and 9.91 kg per day; daily live- 
weight  gains were 0.89 kg, 0.74 kg and 0.94 kg/day  and daily carcase  
gains were 0.58, 0.45 and 0.47 kg/day  for direct cut, medium  wilted  
and heavily  wilted silage, respectively.  The efficiency  of utilization  of 
ingested  silage DM for carcase  production  was 15.66, 19.91 and 21.85  
kg DM intake/kg  carcase  gain for direct  cut, medium  wilted  and heavily 
wilted silage,  respectively.

AND SUPPLEMENTS

The voluntary  intake and performance  of crossbred  Friesian  steers 
offered  silage only or silage and 2.41 kg barley  dry matter  per day which 
were either fed separately  or in a homogenous  premixed  form, were  
measured.  A total of 30 individually  stalled animals  were used in the 
experiment.  Supplementation  with barley  resulted  in increased  total dry 
matter  intakes  in both methods  of feeding  but the increase  was only 
significant  where the supplement  and roughage  were premixed.  The 
supplement  caused  a significant  decrease  in silage intake  in both methods  
of cereal presentation  but the reduction  in intake was significantly  less 
where silage and supplement  were blended  into a balanced  complete  
feed. Differences  in animal  performance  between  the treatment  groups  
were closely  associated  with the level of feed intake. Supplementation  
with barley improved  daily live-weight  gain and mean carcass  weight 
but this improvement  was only significant  for the animals  fed the pre­
mixed  feed.
Possible  reasons  for the improvement  in animal performance  and 
voluntary  intake  were discussed.

CONCENTRATE  SUPPLEMENTATION  FOR  AUTUMN CALVING
DAIRY  COWS
F. J. GORDON
Agricultural  Research  Institute,  Hillsborough,  Co. Down.
To determine  the optimum  level of coneentrate  supplementation  for 
cows during  the winter  period requires  a knowledge  of the relationship  
between  concentrate  input and milk output. The purpose  of the present  
trial was to establish  this relationship  for autumn  calving  cows having  
access ad libitum  to grass silage. In the experiment  a total of 140 
British  Friesian  cows  were used,  over a three-year  period,  in a randomised  
block experiment  to examine  the effects  of feeding  five concentrate  levels  
of 636, 888, 1140, 1378 and 1586 ± 10.3 kg concentrates  during  the 
winter  period. The cows calved  from late September  to early December  
and had a mean calving  date of October  27.
All concentrates  were offered in two fixed steps during  the lactation  
with the intake during  the first 100 days of lactation  being 2 kg/day  
above that given during  later lactation.  In addition,  all animals  had 
access ad libitum  to grass silage with a mean dry matter  content  and 
D-value  of 218 and 670 g kg"' respectively.  Sixteen  replicates  per treat ­
ment were housed  in individual  stalls for measurement  of silage intake  
while the remaining  replicates were housed  as a single  group  in each year.  
At pasture  all animals  grazed  as a single group without  supplementary  
concentrates.  Increasing  the level of supplementation  reduced  silage in­
take and increased  milk yield during  the winter,  with the silage intakes  
being 1802, 1738, 1666, 1641 and 1581 ± 41.0 kg DM and winter  rtiilk 
yields being 3413, 3586, 3885, 3986 and 4052 ± 49.5 kg per cow for 
treatments  1-5 respectively.  Level of supplementation  had no significant 
effect on milk yield at pasture  and the total lactation  yields  were 5222,  
5553, 5919, 5848 and 5946 ± 112.4 kg per cow for treatments  1-5 respec ­
tively. There were considerable  differences  between  treatments  in live- 
weights  at the end of the winter  but these differences  had disappeared  by 
the end of the grazing  season.
The relationship  between  concentrate  input and total lactation  yield  
has been defined  and from this, the optimum  concentrate  levels  for differ ­
ing ratios of the cost of concentrates  and the value of milk have been 
calculated  and will be presented.  From the data it would  also seem that 
high and low yielding  cows respond  equally  to a change  in concentrate  
input indicating  that all cows irrespective  of yield can receive  the same 
level of coneentrate  when ad libitum  access is given to good quality  
silage.

LAMENESS  IN DAIRY  COWS

A two year study (March  1979 to February  1981)  on lameness  in 3,100  
dairy cows in 20 dairy herds  revealed  a mean annual  animal  incidence  of 
25%. Individual  farm incidence  varied  from 4% to 54%. Right and left 
limbs  were affected  equally.  The forelimbs  were affected  in 18% of cases 
and the hindlimbs  in 82%. The upper  limb (defined  as consisting  of the 
fetlock  joint and the structures  above  this) was involved  in 11% of cases.  
These conditions  were primarily  traumatic  and usually  occurred  during  
the over-wintering  period.
Disease  conditions  of the interdigital  skin caused 12% of lameness. 
Diseases  of the claw (or hoof) caused  77% of lameness  and thus were  
the single most important  category.
Lateral  (outer)  and medial  (inner)  claws were almost  equally  affected  
in the fore limb; in the hind limb the lateral  claw was affected  in 94% 
of claw disease  cases and the medial  in only 6%. The hind lateral  claw 
is thus the affected  structure  in 75% of all hind limb lameness  and 62% 
of all lameness.
The claw disease most frequently  diagnosed  was septic traumatic  
pododermatitis  (60% of cases). This involved  breakdown  or penetration  
of the horn capsule  with subsequent  irritation  of the sensitive  tissue.  
The white line area of the hoof which is an anatomically  vulnerable  site 
within  the hoof was the area most frequently  involved.  Ulceration  of the 
sole (pododermatitis  circumscripta)  was diagnosed  in 18% of claw con­
ditions.  It occurred  only in the hind claws and was most common  in the 
100 day period  p)ost-partum.  The condition  frequently  occurred  in both 
hind feet.
Routine  foot trimming,  as a preventive  measure  based on the redis ­
tribution  of weight  between  lateral  and medial  claws  in the hindlimb,  was 
evaluated  in a field trial using 130 treatment  and 130 control  animals.  
The technique  seems  more promising  as an early  detection  and correction  
routine  rather  than a long term prevention.
Routine  footbathing  was evaluated  over the grazing  period (April to 
November  inclusive)  using a 5% formalin  solution  in a “pass through ” 
bath. One hundred  and twenty  treatment  and 120 control  animals  on the 
same environment  were used. Treatment  did decrease  the incidence  of 
interdigital  conditions  but it had no effect on the incidence  or type of 
claw disease.
Seasonal,  environmental  and husbandry  influences  on claw diseases 
and on horn quality  were discussed.

Growth  promoters  are not widely  used in sheep in Ireland  and there  
is comparatively  little information  available  on their efficacy  in this 
species.
A series  of experiments  have been carried  cut inThe  Agricultural  Insti­
tute on the effects  of anabolic  steroids  on the performance  of Blackface  
Mountain  wether  lambs  and of suckling  and early  weaned  lowland  lambs.  
The steroids  evaluated  include  Ralgro,  Finaplix,  Synovex,  Revalor  and 
combinations of  Ralgro  and Finaplix  and of Synovex  and Finaplix.
The responses  to the treatments  evaluated  have been very variable.  In 
the case of Blackface  Mountain  lambs fed indoor  on concentrates  the 
changes  in daily liveweight  gain and food conversion  efficiency  ranged  
from 0-28%  and 0-24%  respectively.  The best improvement  in perform ­
ance was obtained  from a combination  of Synovex  and Finaplix.  This 
combination  gave a good response  with lowland  lambs  also.

OESTRUS  BEHAVIOUR  IN HEIFERS
A. M. A. KARIEM  and W. J. McCAUGHEY
Faculty  of Agriculture,  Queens ’ University,  Belfast  and Veterinary  
Research  Laboratories,  Stormont,  Belfast,
The activity  of five beef type heifers  and one freemartin,  housed  and 
fed on concentrates  (2^ kgs per day) and hay, was continuously  monitored  
by time lapse video recording.  The records  obtained  were analysed  to 
determine  the effect of oestrus  on general  activity  and the frequency  of 
four specific components  of oestrous  behaviour.  The occurrence  of 
oestrus  was assessed  by daily blood plasma  progesterone  assay. The 
normal  behaviour  of the heifers  was not otherwise  interrupted  throughout  
the observation  period. Oestrus  was defined  as the period  during  which 
normal  behaviour  was altered  and fifteen  such periods  were recorded.
The duration  of oestrous  behaviour  was 12 + 4 hours. This was highly  
variable  and influenced  by the number  of heifers  simultaneously  in oes­
trus. During  this period  the heifer in oestrus  had a marked  increase  in 
general  activity  frequently  remaining  standing  for 80% of the time. After  
oestrus  the general  activity  declined  rapidly  returning  to normal  within 
48 hours. When more than two heifers  were in oestrus  general  activity 
took longer  to return  to normal.
All heifers  showed  standing  behaviour  during  oestrus. This activity 
was not shown  at any other time and was absent  from the record  of the 
freemartin.  The smallest  number  of “stands”  was 4. Heifers  recorded  
as standing  on few occasions  demonstrated  all the other components  of 
oestrous  behaviour,  e.g. attempting  to mount  others,  sniffing  or soliciting.  
The decreased  frequency  of standing  activity  therefore  appeared  to be 
caused  by a lack of interest  on the part of the non-oestrous  heifers.  There  
was no obvious  reason  for this variation  in behaviour.
There was no consistent  pattern  or timing  to the other components  of 
behaviour  that could be linked  either  to the beginning  or end of standing  
behaviour.  There was considerable  variation  both in frequency  and 
timing  of events  both between  heifers  and between  oestrus  periods  in the 
same heifer. The most active period  of oestrous  behaviour  was between 
midnight  and 6.00 am (37%)  and activity  was least (17%)  between  6.00 
am and noon.
These preliminary  observations  suggest  that visual observations  of all 
heats in small groups  of heifers  is difficult  because  of the variation  in 
behaviour  that occurs. Each heat period  observed  in this study included 
some standing  to be mounted  behaviour  but the short duration  (2-20  
secs) of each “stand ” and, the infrequent  occurrence,  shows that this 
specific  behaviour  can be very difficult  to observe. Since the general 
activity  of each heifer in heat arises considerably  it may be that an 
objective  measure  of activity  will prove  an aid in heat detection.

THE USE OF A NEW PROSTAGLANDIN  ANALOGUE  (K11941)  
FOR INDUCTION  OF PARTURITION  IN THE SOW
M. P. BOLAND  and M. J. HERLIHY
Department  of Agriculture,  U.C.D.,  Lyons  Estate,  Newcastle,
Co. Dublin.
With increasing  economic  pressures  on pig producers,  it is essential  
that the number  of pigs weaned  per sow per year be increased.  Induction  
of farrowing  at a specified  time is one means  of increasing  the work  
supervision  so that more piglets  may be saved at or around  the time of 
birth.
In the present  trial 79 sows were randomly  assigned  to one of 5 groups  
and received  either 1 ml, 2 ml or 3 ml of a synthetic  prostaglandin  
K11941,  or 0.7 ml of Estrumate,  or 2 ml Saline  (control)  on day 114 of 
gestation.  The average  herd gestation  length  was 116 days. All prosta ­
glandin  analogues  effectively  induced  parturition  at mean intervals  of 
22.3, 24.9, 27.7 and 24.0 hrs respectively;  control  sows farrowed  at a 
mean interval  of 51.1 hrs after injection.  Induction  of farrowing  did not 
have an effect on birth weight,  piglet survival  to 3 weeks or on the 
subsequent  weaning  to service  interval.
In a second  trial using  a new synthetic  progestagen  (Regumate),  oestrus  
was effectively  controlled  using 20 mg/head/day.  Using  2 ml of K11941  
in similar  sows, only a slightly  shorter  interval  to oestrus  was observed  
when compared  with controls.

OESTRUS  SYNCHRONISATION  IN WEANED  SOWS USING
OESTROGEN

The synchronisation  of oestrus  in sows after weaning  would  significantly  
improve  the annual  productivity  in a majority  of commercial  pig herds. 
This study presents  the results  of a series of experiments  on the use of 
oestradiol  benzoate  (O.B.)  after weaning  for such a purpose.  Four  groups  
of sows were injeeted  i.m. with a weight  related  dose of O.B. 1 or 2 days  
after  weaning  at either  3 or 5 weeks  pcst-partum.  All treated  sows showed  
standing  oestrus  3 days after injection,  with high doses  of O.B. (60 ug/kg  
vs 30 ug/kg)  resulting  in an abnormal  oestrus.  O.B. treatment  at day + 
1 (weaning  = day 0) significantly  reduced  ovulation  rates whilst  treatment  
at day + 2, resulted  in only a slight decrease  whieh was not significant.  
Shortening  lactation  length from 5 to 3 weeks  reduced  ovluation  rates  
significantly  after treatment  at day + 2.
Thirteen  sows were slaughtered  at either  day 3 or day 30 pcst-coitum  
and the limited  data available  indieates  that fertilization  and conception  
rates are normal  after O.B. treatment.
The endocrine  responses  to O.B. treatment  on day + 2 after weaning  
at 3 or 5 weeks  pcst-partum  show a consistent  synchronisation  of both 
the pre-ovulatory  LH surge and the post-ovulatory  rise in plasma  pro­
gesterone  indieating  that O.B. is effective  in synchronising  oestrus  and 
ovulation  in weaned  sows with apparently  normal  embryo  development  
to 30 days pcst-coitum.
HEAT  SEEKING  BEHAVIOUR  OF NEWBORN  PIGS

Covered  plywood  creep boxes 1.2 m x 0.5 m x 0.4 m high heated  by 
incandescent  light bulbs  were placed  at the front of farrowing  pens and 
provided  the sole local heat source  for newborn  pigs. Piglet behaviour  
to 4 days of age was studied  at two room temperatures  24°C and 17°C.  
Two experiments  were earried  out (a) with and (b) without  room lighting 
and involving  12 and 16 sows respectively.  Hardly  any pigs used the 
creep  boxes  on the day of birth but usage inereased  with age. Usage  was 
significantly  greater  at 17°C than at 24°C (P<0.01)  and also tended  to 
be higher  in the darkened  room. The rectal temperatures  of piglets  was 
significantly  lower  at 17°C (P<0.01)  at 1 hour, 24 hours  and 48 hours  of 
age in both experiments  but the difference  between  the two groups  
decreased  with age. A heated creep box does not appear  to provide  
sufficient  protection  from chilling  for neonatal  pigs.

THE DIGESTIBLE  AND METABOLISABLE  ENERGY  VALUE  
OF A WET LEAF PROTEIN  CONCENTRATE  FOR PIGS

Agricultural  Institute,  Dunsinea,  Castleknock,  Co. Dublin.
Juice was extracted  from a precision  chopped  autumn  grass crop,  
predominantly  ryegrass,  by pulping  in a modified  hammer  mill and 
squeezing  the pulp on an endless  belt press. The juice was adjusted  to 
pH 4.0 with formic  acid and the precipitated  protein  recovered  by high 
speed centrifugation.  The average  time lapse from preparation  of juice 
was 5-6 days. Protein  was recovered  as a wet cake with a dry matter  
content  of 21-27%.  On a dry matter  basis it had 48% crude protein,  
15% fat, 8% NDF and 6.6% ash. Prior to use in a metabolism  trial it 
was held at — 20°C.
Six male castrated  littermate  pigs averaging  25 kg live weight  were  
used in a digestibility  trial. A mineral  and vitamin  supplemented  basal  
ration  of barley  was used to which cake was added  to provide  20% of 
the total dry matter  intake. A similar  soya ration  was used as a control.
The digestible  (DE) and metabolisable  energy (ME) values  for the 
basal ration  were 14.4 MJ/kg  and 14.2 MJ/kg  DM. The corresponding  
values  for the protein  cake and soyabean  meal are 13.5, 12.3, 15.3 and 
14.8 MJ/kg  dry matter  respectively.

EFFECT  OF STOCKING  RATE  AND ANTIBIOTIC  ON PIG
PERFORMANCE

The experiment  was undertaken  in a naturally  ventilated  piggery  hav­
ing 40 pens in a common  air space. Pens measured  4.7 x 2.3 m and were 
stocked  with either 16 or 18 pigs giving a floor allowance  of 0.64 and 
0.57 m^ per pig respectively.  Pigs were fed frcm a feed hopper  that 
allowed  1.6 m feeding  space. Feeding  was to scale in that sufficient  feed 
was given at 9 am daily to allow^a  6-hour  feeding  period. A fortified  
barley-soyabean  meal ration  containing  12.6 MJ DE/kg  and 0.8% lysine  
and supplemented  with 0 or 20 ppm Avoparcin  was fed throughout.  Thus  
the experiment  compared  2 stocking  levels x 2 antibiotic  levels and 
involved  1360 pigs selected  on the basis of sex and initial weight. The 
experimental  period  was from 30 to 80 kg liveweight.
Pig performance  was basically  good with only 5 pigs dying or taken  
off the experiment.  The higher stocking  rate resulted  in a significant  
deterioration  in feed intake (P<0.001),  daily carcass  gain (P^.OOl)  and 
feed utilization  (P<.01)  while there was an increase  in kill-out  % (P< 
.001).  Antibiotic  had no effect  on feed intake  but it improved  carcass  gain 
and feed utilization.  Veterinary  interventions  or mortality  were not 
influenced  by treatment.

The effects  of sodium  hydroxide  treatment  of barley  straw were evalu ­
ated in two experiments.  In experiment  1, two groups  of 12 bulls (401 
kg) were given either  treated  or untreated  straw to appetite  plus 5 kg of 
concentrates  (73.5 % bar.ey,  25% soya, 1.5% minerals  and vitamins)  
daily for 187 days, in experiment  2. six groups  of eight heifers  (309 kg) 
were individually  given treated  or untreated  straw to appetite  plus 4 kg 
concentrates  daily containing  10, 20 or 30% soya for 100 days. A JF SP 
2000 machine  was used to apply the sodium  hydroxide  (45 kg/t dry 
matter (DM)) and the untreated  straw was chopped  with the same  
machine.  All animals  were slaughtered  at the end of the experimental  
periods.  In. both experiments  alkali treatment  increased  straw digestibil ­
ity. Estimated  carcass  gains in experiment  1 were 83.0 and 103.6 kg 
(s.e. 5.71) for the untreated  and treated  straws  respectively.  Corresponding  
DM intakes  were 4.7 and 5.2 (s.e. 0.11) kg/day.  In experiment  2, daily  
straw DM intakes  were 3.6, 4.1 and 4.3 (s.e. 0.13) kg respectively  for the 
10, 20 and 30% soya treatments.  However,  the level of soya did not affect 
carcass  gain. Average  carcass gains  for untreated  and treated  straws  were 
35.7 and 54.7 (s.e. 1.00) kg respectively.  Corresponding  straw  DM intakes  
were 3.5 and 4.5 (s.e. 0.10) kg/day. Animals  given treated  straw had 
higher  willing-out  percentages  than those given untreated  straw, both in 
experiment  1 (54.0 v. 51.0, s.e. 0.45) and in experiment  2 (49.6 v. 47.4,  
s.e. 0.26). Treatment  of straw with sodium  hydroxide  increased  animal ’ 
performance  but live-weight  gain was not a good indicator  of carcass  gam.
