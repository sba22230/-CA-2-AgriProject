A Review  of The Grass  Growing  
Year 1989
P. DILLON  and G. STAKELUM  
Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
Efficient  production  and utilisation  of grass  were  never  so important  for dairy  
fanning  as at the present  With  the imposition  of milk  quotas  and more  recently  
^e falling  milk  price,  input  costs  must  be minimised.  Efficient  use of grassland  
is the key. In this paper  the grass  growing  season  of 1989  and the management  
factors  adopted  at Moorepark  to alleviate  the effect  of the mid-summer  drought  
are outlilned.  Results  are also reptorted  on two concentrate  supplementation  
trials  at pasture  with different  energy  and protein  sources.
Grass  growth  versus  cow requirement  
Figure  1 shows  thedverageseasonal  growth  pattern  of grassfor  1982-7,1988  
and 1989. Figures  2 and 3 show  seasonal  growth  patterns  for 1988 versus  the 
^owth  pattern  required  to supply  a given  level  of DM intake.  Cow  requirement  
is based  on a stocking  rate  of 0.85  acres/cow  with  45 and 35 percent  of the farm  
closed  for firstcutand  second  cut silage,  respectively,  with  high  level  of nitrogen  
usage and concentrates  taken out of the system  by late April. The intake  
requirement  is based  on a cow  of average  bodyweight  550  kg. a January  1 cal  ving 
date and an adjustment  for stage  of lactation  (ARC,  1980). In 1988 seasonal  
growth  pattern  was  greater  than cow requirement  until  the end of September.  In 
contrast  there  was a large  deficit  in cow requirement  during  late July and early  
August  in 1989. A feature  of 1989 was the poor growth  rate during  the April  
period  and the very good  grass  growth  in late August  and September.
Silage  yield  and quality
Table 1 shows  the silage  analyses  for the Dairymis  II Discussion  Group  in 
Fermoy  (28 farmers)  for both 1988 and 1989. The first cut silages  were on

average  of a higher  dry matter  content,  similar  preservation  and slightly  higher  
digestibility  for 1989  when  compared  to 1988. The second  cut silages  were  also 
of higher  diy matter  content,  with equally  good  preservation  and much  higher  
digestibility.  The third  cut silages  had smilar  analyses  of equally  good  quality.
Table  2 shows  the silage  yield  and  digestibilities  for Curtins  farm  at Moorepark.  
The notable  feature  is the very  poor  yield  of second  cut silage  and the very  large  
yield for the third  cut. This shows  the advantage  of taking  a third  cut of silage  
in a year with severe  drought  conditions  in mid-summer.  This  cut of silage  was 
also taken  without  having  a feed deficit  on the grazing  area (Figure  3).
Measures  taken  during  the drought  period
As we have seen in Figure  3 there  was a large  feed deficit  pteriod  in the late 
July-August  period.  Figure  4 shows  part  of a lactation  curve  for a herd  of cows

at Moorepark.  Daily  milk  yields  were  reduced  by almost  0.7 gals/cow  in the two 
weeks  at the onset  of the droughL  During  the following  four weeks  when  grass  
growth  was almost  at zero the cows  were  supplemented  with 5 kg. of hay plus 
20 kg. of wet brewers  grains.  In this period  it was  estimated  that the cows  were  
being supplemented  with 80% of their feed requirement.  The supplements  
maintained  milk yields  at 14.5 kg./cow/day.  It can be seen from Figure  4 that 
when  grass  growth  recovered  the milk yield of the cows  partially  recovered.
Supplementary  feeding  of grazing dairy  cows
Supplementation  of grazed  pasture  may be necessary  in early spring  after  
turn out due to poor  grass  growth,  in mid-summer  in the event  of a drought  and

from September  onwards  due to declining  growth  rates  of grass. "Hie type of 
supplement  fed can range from a forage,  i.e. a high quality  silage, to a 
concenu^te.  A concenu-ate  can be either  an energy  and/or  a protein  source.  Milk  
production  responses  to concentrate  feeding  have generally  been poor and 
uneconomical.  The major  reason  for the poor  responses  to concenOrate  feeding  
at pasture  is the substitution  of concentrate  for grazed  grass. This is defined  as 
the decrease  in grass intake  per unit of concentrate  fed. The most important  
factors  that  affect  substitution  rate  are grass  intake  and digestibility.  When  intake  
or digestibility  of grass  is high substitution  rate is also high. Many  other  factors  
affect  substitution  rate, such as concentrate  type, lactation  stage,  cow genetic  
merit  and level  of concentrate  feeding.  Experiments  at Moorepark  from 1976-

1987 under  a wide range of grazing  pressures,  types of concentrates  and at 
different  times  of the grazing  season  gave  an average  response  of 0.50  kg. milk/  
kg. of concentrate.  Table  3 shows  the milk/concentrate  price  ratio from 1982- 
1989, taking  the average  milk and concentrate  prices  from the Dairymis  II 
Discussion  Group  in Fermoy.  Over that period  the price of milk increased  
relative  to the cost of concentrate.  Therefore  the break-even  milk production  
response  in 1989  was  0.68  kg. milk/kg.  of  concentrate  fed when  concentrate  costs  
£ 140/tonne and  milk was priced  at 22p/kg.
Two  experiments  were  carried  out in Moorepark  during  the grazing  season  in 
1989 with different  energy  and protein  sources  as supplements  to grazing  dairy  
cows.

Experiment  A
High quality  fibrous  concentrates  have been reported  to give higher  milk  
production  responses  and lower  substitution  rates  compared  to starchy  concen ­
trates  when  fed to grazing  dairy  cows  (Meijs,  1985).  Very  large  substitution  rates  
with barley  compared  to both molassed  beet  pulp or beet  pulp nuts were  found  
with  grazing  dairy  cows  (Stakelum  and Dillon  1988).  The  large  substitution  rate 
was associated  with reduced  pH and increased  lactate  concentration  in rumen  
fluid  shortly  after  feeding  (Dillon,  Stakelum  and Murphy,  1989).
Four  groups  of 22 cows  were  assigned  to four  treatments,  i.e. grass  only,  grass  
plus barley,  grass  plus molassed  beet pulp and grass  plus brewers  grains. The 
experiment  was conducted  for 13 weeks  from late July until late October.  The 
supplements  were fed immediately  after morning  milking. The barley  ^d 
molassed  beet  pulp  were  fed at4 kg. /cow/day  for the first4  weeks  in conjunction

with 4 kg. of hay supplement.  Thereafer,  as grass growth  returned  to normal  
following  the end of the drought,  the cows  were  fed 5 kg./cow/day  with no hay 
supplement  The  brewers  grains  were  fed at 15 kg./cow/day  for the first  4 weeks  
and thereafter  at 20 kg./cow/day . The  chemical  composition  of the supplements  
are given  in Table  4. Table  5 shows  the milk  yield,  milk  composition  and milk  
yield  response  to the different  supplements.  All three  supplements  significantly  
increased  milk yield over the control.  The molassed  beet pulp and brewers  
grains  gave significantly  higher  milk yield than the barley  supplement.  Fat 
content  was significantly  decreased  in the brewers  grains  and barley  groups  
compared  with the grass only treatment.  Protein  content  was significanUy  
increased  for the barley  and molassed  beet pulp compared  with the grass  only 
treatment.  Figure  5 outlines  the milk production  pattern  of the four treatment  
groups.  There  appeared  to be no difference  in milk yield  during  the first four 
weeks  when the  hay supplement  was fed. During  the later  part  of the experiment  
after  grass  growth  rate resumed  the differences  between  the groups  manifested  
themselves.  The experiment  supports  previous  work that higher  milk yield  
responses  are obtained  with high quality  fibrous  concentrates  compart  to 
starchy  concentrates  when  fed at pasture.
Experiment  B
The  crude  protein  fraction  of grazed  herbage  is a complex  mixture  of  proteins,  
peptides,  amino  acids  and non-protein  nitrogen.  When  herbageenters  the rumen,  
the rumen  microflora  ferment  the soluble  and structural  carbohydrates  to yield  
a mixture  of volatile  fatty  acids. In so doing  they  also  digest  the protein  fraction  
in the herbage  with the release  of ammonia.  Subsequently  the microflora

synthesise  their  own protein  and utilise  the ammonia  as a nitrogen  source.  The 
net result  is that  a major  portion  of the protein  passing  out of the rumen  and into 
the small intestines  is of microbial  origin. Microbial  protein  is of average  
biological  value, i.e. it could be deficient  in certain  essential  amino  acids.  
Therefore  when higher  quality  unprotected  protein  is fed (high in biological  
value) it can be transformed  into low quality  by breakdown  in the rumen.  There  
is evidence  in the literature  that there  is a positive  response  in milk  production  
to feeding  protected  protein  at pasture  (Minson,  1981).
Figure  6 outlines  the crude  protein  content  of herbage  across  a full grazing  
season.  More  recent  results  at Moorepark  show  that the actual  herbage  selected  
by the grazing  cow is of a still higher  crude  protein  content.  Experiments  at 
Moorepark  indicate  that of the total herbage  crude  protein  ingested,  75% is 
rapidly  degraded  in the rumen  (RDP)  and 25%  is resistant  to further  breakdown  
and passes  onto the small  intestines  as undegraded  protein  (UDP)  (Stakelum,  
Dillon  and Murphy,  1988;  Dillon  et al., 1989). An experiment  was conducted  
in Curtins  farm at Moorepark  to evaluate  milk  production  responses  to different  
protein  supplements  compared  to an energy  source.  Four  groups  of 18 cows  were  
assigned  to four treatments,  i.e. a grass  only  group,  grass  plus 3.2 kg. of barley.

grass plus 3 kg. of soyabean  meal and grass plus 3 kg. of sopralin. The 
experiment  lasted  nine weeks  from early  September  until late November  when  
cows were late in lactation.  The supplements  were fed immediately  after the 
morning  milking.  The chemical  composition  of the feeds  is given  in Table  7. 
Table  8 shows  the milk  yield, milk  composition  and milk yield  responses  to the 
different  supplements.  The sopralin  supplement  significantly  increased  milk 
yield and decreased  fat content  over the grass  only treatment.  The barley  and 
soya supplements  significantly  increased  protein  content.  It is not possible  to 
explain  whether  the much  larger  positive  response  to the sopralin  was due to 
more amino  acids reaching  the small intestines  or a dietary  energy  response.  
However,  the response  to sopralin  is not an economic  one due to the high  price  
of the concentrate.  The much  lower  response  to the barley  in this experiment  
compared  to Experiment  A was due to a higher  supply  of grass.
Conclusion
With falling  milk prices and fixed quotas  it is imperative  that grassland  
management  be excellent  and that concentrate  feeding  on grass is eliminated
11
where  adequate  grass is available.  However,  there can be periods  during  the 
grazing  season  when  cows might  be short  of feed (i.e. drought  of 1989)  and a 
supplement  would  then  need  to be fed. There  is clear  evidence  that  a fibrous  type 
concentrate  gives  much  better  milk yield responses  than a starchy  concentrate  
when fed as a supplement  to grazing  dairy cows. In the future,  however,  
conserving  extra  silage  in order  to use it as a supplemnt  during  periods  of grass  
shortage  may  be more  economical.  The  surpluses  which  arise  during  the grazing  
season  could  be conserved  as silage  by the use of a flexible  management  system  
based on tight grazing  to 6 cm in order to maximise  quality  of grass under  
grazing.  At present  it is not possible  to define  under  what circumstances  an 
economical  response  may be got from feeding  undegradable  protein.  Where  
adequate  grass  was available,  very  poor  responses  were  obtained  from feeding  
degradable  protein.

Breeding  Policies  for the ’90's
PROF.  E. P. CUNNINGHAM,
Dept,  of Genetics,  Trinity  College,  Dublin  2.
The American  economist  Francis  Fukuyama,  viewing  the collapse  of com­
munism  in Eastern  Europe,  recently  announced  "This  is the end of history".  He 
exaggerates  of course,  but looking  at the current  and impending  changes  on the 
cattle  breeding  scene  here  in Ireland,  and indeed  throughout  Europe,  one  can feel 
a similar  sense  that  an old order  is passing  and that  the future  will  be very  different  
from  what  we have been used to.
♦ The decades  of growth  in output  fuelled  by expanding  population,  rising  
living  standards  and the sustaining  hand  of Brussels,  have  come  to an end. 
In those  days,  the good,  the mediocre  and the bad could  all survive.  For the 
future,  the uncompetitive  will face declining  fortunes.  That applies  to 
breeds,  breeding  programmes  and breeders,  as well as to farmers  and 
farming  systems.
♦ Governments  everywhere  are getting  out of the breeding  business,  and 
nowhere  faster  than in Ireland.
♦ In  its drive  to "complete  the internal  market"  by 1992,  the EEC  has ordained  
a deregulation  of the AI industry.  That  industry  in Ireland,  as elsewhere,  has 
developed  as a protected  monopoly; in future  it will have  to fight  for its share  
of the market.
♦ The quota  regime  changes  dairy  farmers'  breeding  objectives;  for some  it 
intensifies  the drive to more specialised  dairy types,  while for others  it 
signals  a return  to dual purpose  aims.
♦ The search  for new breeds  is finished;  we have Died all the likely beef 
breeds,  and the Holstein  is the third and last foreign  wave  of dairy  genetic  
material  to hit our shores.
♦ Two elements  of semen and embryo  technology,  at present  showing  
promise  in the laboratory,  have the potential  to change  the cattle  breeding  
scene  beyond  anything  we would  recognise.
The purpose  of this paper  is to discuss  our options  in the light  of these  develop ­
ments.
AI
Al is the principal  medium  for genetic  improvement  in our cattle. Not alone  
are more  than half the cows  bred by AI, but most  of the remainder  are bred by 
sons  of AI bulls. Furthermore,  it is the sector  in which  policy  decisions  can have  
a big impact;  several  bulls here bred over 30,000  progeny  each last year.
The percent  of cows  bred  by Al in Ireland  is rather  low by European  standards  
(Table  1). Our figure  is 51%, the lowest  in northern  Europe.  Elsewhere,  with 
the exception  of Britain  and France,  the norm is 90% or higher.

Part of the reason  for the low AI usage  in Britain  and France  is the high 
proportion  of beef  cows  in those  countries.  For obvious  reasons,  AI is both  less 
convenient  and less obviously  valuable  in suckler  herds. In France,  while  AI 
usage  is 80%  in dairy  herds,  it is only 20%  in suckler  herds.  Perhaps  this is the 
reason  for  the low  penetration  rate  here,  though  curiously,  a survey  of600  suckler  
herds  in 1985 by G. J. More  O’Ferrall  and colleagues  showed  a 60% AI usage  
level. At any rate, there seems  to be no good reason  why we should  be so 
significantly  behind  the rest  of northern  Europe  in AI usage  levels,  and  one  of the 
expectations  for the future  should  be an increase  in its use.
The structure  of the AI business  in Ireland  has remained  essentially  un­
changed  for over 30 years,  with two exceptions:  Ballyhaise  gave  up their  bull 
stud, and the five Munster  centres  set up a joint bull acquisition  and testing  
programme.  We can expect  substantial  changes  in the near future. Elsewhere  
in Europe,  AI organisations  are amalgamating  and consolidating  to face the 
competition  which  will  come  with  the EEC  deregulation  of 1992.  The  legislation  
for this is already  in place,  and its intention  is to promote  free trade  in semen  and 
embryos  within  the Community.  Health  regulations,  which  have isolated  us 
from  Continnetal  imports  in the past,  will no longer  be a problem.  Among  other  
things,  the Commission  proposes  to eliminate  Foot and Mouth  vaccination  
throughout  the Community.
Indeed,  this competition  is already  here  in a substantial  way;  this year  at least  
100,000  units  of semen  will be imported.  This is almost  all high performance  
Holstein  semen,  coming  from  Holland,  Denmark,  France,  New  Zealand,  Canada  
and the US. We will pay out at least  £1.5m.  for it. While  that is only sufficient  
to breed  a quarter  of our AI bred Friesian  cows,  it is, in financial  terms,  much  
more  significant.  All of the semen  produced  by the Irish  AI organisations  has a 
production  cost  of less than  £1 a straw,  and we could  therefore  say that  the money  
spent  on imported  semen  this year  will be greater  than the revenue  to our own  AI 
system  for all of the semen  it produces.  Another  way of putting  it is that the 
import  cost of this Holstein  semen  is about  three  times  what  we are currently  
spending  on improving  our own Friesians.
14
Our domestic  AI industry  is therefore  under  threat.  The challenge  is not so 
much  on the technical  side. The  efficiency  of the "arm  service"  seems  to be good,  
to judge  from published  non-retum  rates. The pressure  will come  more  on the 
quality  of the genetic  material  on offer  and on operational  costs.
While  half  of Irish AI is with beef  breed  semen,  the battle  for survival  will 
largely  be fought  out on dairy  merit There  are a couple  of reasons  for this. The 
first  is that the customer  has a choice  of about  10 beef  breeds,  so that most  of his 
requirements  are met by having  reasonable  bulls of these breeds  available.  
Secondly , performance  and  progeny  testing  for beef,  and  calving  surveys,  are not 
so expensive  as dairy  testing,  so that most  AI centres  can provide  at least  some  
documented  merit  in individual  bulls  within  each  breed.  Thirdly,  because  of the 
wide  variety  of beef  production  systems,  the internationally  trading  AI organ ­
isations  have  not found  it worthwhile  to make  large investments  in generating  
outstanding  genetic  merit  in the beef  breeds.
The Dairy  Breeding  Programme
In Ireland,  as everywhere  else, we have a fairly well defined  system  of 
progeny  testing  and selection  of dairy  bulls. Currently,  we are testing  36 bulls  
per year,  and selecting  about  1 in 4 after  the progeny  test is complete.  Along  the 
way,  these  bulls  are now mostly  reared  either  in Bandon  or in Sligo,  so that some  
comparative  growth  and feed efficiency  information  is available  on them,  and 
most  of them  also  have  beef  progeny  tests  based  on 20 steers  reared  to slaughter.  
The whole  exercise  is a fairly  costly  one. The question  is how cost  effective  it 
is, and how competitive  it is likely  to be in future.
The formal  selection  goal  in most  European  dairy  and dual purpose  AI cattle  
selection  programmes  normally  includes  about  12 separate  traits. These  cover  
milk production  (milk,  fat and protein),  beef  production  (growth,  fatness  and 
conformation),  calving  ease  and mortality,  and linear  type  traits  indicating  dairy  
utility. This is the list currently  used in Ireland.  In other  countries,  additional  
information  is provided  on milking  speed,  temperament,  fertility  and health  
(mastitis  and ketosis). In all cases, including  Ireland,  ultimate  selection  is 
effectively  exercised  on a milk  production  index,  which generally  combines  fat 
and protein  yields  with a higher  weighting  on protein
These  selection  objectives  are not likely  to change  seriously  in the future.  If 
anything  the concentration  on milk  production  traits  will increase.  In particular,  
two developments  are likely  to reinforce  this. The first  is that as production  per 
cow increases  and as dairy farming  becomes  more specialised,  the breeder's  
interest  becomes  more  narrowly  focused  on dairy  production.  The  second  is that 
the higher  the level of beef  crossing  in the dairy  herd,  the more  the dairy  farmer  
can concentrate  his attention  on dairy traits in the sires he uses to breed  his 
replacement  heifers.  If and when  sexed  semen becomes  available,  this speciali ­
sation  will be carried  to the ultimate  extent.
Cost benefit  studies
I have conducted  a number  of cost benefit  studies  on AI related  breeding  
programmes  over the years and most recently  one for the Munster  Cattle
15
Breeding  Society. The first stage of such a study is to define  the breeding  
objective.  I concentrated  on three  milk  production  traits  (milk  yield,  fat yield  and 
protein  yield)  and two beef  traits  (growth  rate  and  carcass  conformation).  These  
determine  most  of the selection  decisions  that are made.
Milk  volume  has a negative  value. Most  of this is a transport  charge  of about  
Ip/kg. Adding  on farm refrigeration  costs,  and making  some allowance  for 
inplant  costs,  we have taken  a negative  value  of -1.25p/kg  of milk volume.
Fat and protein  are valued  in relation  to world  prices. Both butter  and skim  
milk powder  had prices  last autumn  of about  £1,3(X)  per tonne. For SMP,  this 
is not far off the intervention  price,  while  for butter  the intervention  price  is twice  
the world  price.  Translating  the world  prices  back  to values  for milk  protein  and 
butterfat  gives  values  of £1.61/kg  of butterfat  and £3.50/kg  protein.
To arrive  at net values  for these,  we have subtracted  the marginal  feed cost 
required.  Assuming  the feed input  consists  of grazed  grass (64%),  conserved  
grass  (26%)  and concentrates  (10%),  and that these  have  relative  costs  per unit 
of metabolisable  energy  (MJME)  of 1: 2 : 3, we can calculate  the average  cost 
of a unit of feed energy.  This works  out at 0.75p  per MJME.  A kilogram  of 
butterfat  requires  about  69 MJME  of feed input,  while  a kilogram  of protein  
requires  about  36 MJME.  Feed  costs  are therefore  52p and 27p respectively.
For growth  rate, we took  a gross  value  of 250p/kg  of carcass,  and subtracted  
the cost  of the 200 MJME  of energy  required  to produce  that. Improvements  in 
carcass  conformation  require  no additional  energy  but are quite  complicated  to 
calculate,  because  of the price  differential  on conformation  varies  over  years  and 
by type  and weight  of animal.  Taking  five years'  data,  we arrived  at a value  of 
aboutt  5p/kg.  for one grade  change.  On a 330 kg.  animal  this is worth  £16.50.  
These  economic  values  are summarised  in Table  2.

High  value  of protein
The net values  we have  airived  at are substantially  different  from  those  that 
have been used in the breeding  programme  in recent  years. In particular,  they 
gave  protein  nearly  three  times  the weighting  per  kilogram  of butterfat,  while  the 
present  RB182 weightings  give  protein  1.4 times  the weighting  of butterfat  The 
RB182 values  are very  much  in line  with  those  of  progressive  European  breeding  
schemes  in recent  years. However,  it is notable  that late last year  Ixith the Dutch  
and the French  have  revised  their  weightings,  in both  cases  to give  several  times  
the value  to protein  that they give to fat

In carrying  out these  calculations,  we used  the discounted  gene  flow  method  
and the computer  programme  SELIND,  both  of which  were  developed  here  and 
which  are quite  widely  used for these  purposes  elsewhere.
Relative  gains  from different  programmes
The present  Irish  programme  aims  to acquire  about  80 young  bulls  each  year,  
to progeny  test 40 and to select  10. Three  variants  of the present  (8040-10)  
programme  have  been  investigated.  The  first  is a simple  doubling  of the number  
of bulls  tested  at each  stage,  with the number  finally  calculated  held  constant  at 
five. This is represented  at (160-80-10).  Performance  testing  is cheaper  than 
progeny  testing,  so we have  looked  at doubling  this element  along  (16040-10).  
Finally,  since  the performance  test, while  inexpensive,  does  not contribute  a lot 
to ultimate  gain,  we have  looked  at kc->:ping  it constant  and doubling  the progeny  
testing  stage  (80-80-10).
The returns  in each case  will depend  on whether  a farmer  retains  his surplus  
calves  or sells  them  (in which  case  he is presumed  to keep  a quarter  of the genetic  
merit  for beef  traits).  It is also  of interest  to compare  the eff^ect  of the milk  quota  
regime.  We have  assumed  that the quota  reduces  the value  of improvement  in 
dairy  traits  by three  quarters.  The results  in each case are therefore  presented  
with and without  quota,  and with  calves  sold and reared.  The results  are given  
in Table  3.

the user. Assuming  that the AI costs  £14,  and that about  £10 of this would  have  
been required  to get a cow in calf, the genetic  benefit  from  AI is worth  close  to 
£30.

£10) from the prequota  system.  'y
♦ A farmer  who rears  his calves  gains  on average  an additional  £3 from the 
genetic  merit  provided  (range  £2 - £4).
♦ Doubling  the scale  of the programme  adds  about  £9 of benefit  per AI (£11.00  
before  quotas).
♦ Doubling  the performance  test  adds  about  £3. Doubling  the progeny  test  adds  
about  £6.
International  comparisons
A couple  of years  ago, I published  a comparison  of 30 breeding  programmes  
in Europe,  the US  A and  New  Zealand.  I reduced  the comparison  to two structural  
statistics:  the number  of bulls tested  i)er million  AI and the lifetime  usage  of 
selected  bulls. The results  are shown  in Figure  1. Briefly,  this shows  that the 
European  programmes  are testing  large  numbers  of bulls  but making  relatively  
little use of the selected  ones, while the American  programmes  tested  much  
fewer  bulls  but used them  more  extensively.  This difference  in strategy  can be 
easily  rationalised.  In Europe,  each AI organisation  has served  a fairly  small  
market  on monopoly  basis.  In America,  they  all have  access  to huge  markets  and 
must  comjjete  with  each  other. The New  Zealand  Jersey  and Friesian  program ­
mes were  outstanding  mainly  because  of their  huge  usage  levels.  The Irish and 
British  programmes  were  micing  the lowest  investments  in bull testin  tr of all the 
European  schemes.

I did the calculations  again last year, and was surprised  at how little had 
changed.  In most European  programmes  they are still testing  four times  the 
number  of bulls  that we lest per million  inseminations.  The  one major  improve ­
ment  here has been the success  of the fresh semen  programme  in the Munster  
group,  which  has pushed  bull usage  levels  for the best  selected  bulls  well  beyond  
what  most  European  organisations  can achieve.
Since  most  AI organisations  are now selecting  for the same  objectives,  with 
the same  basic stock,  differences  in level  of investment  will largely  determine  
competitive  ability. I calculate  that our current  Friesian  testing  and selection  
programme  is costing  about  half a million  pounds,  or about  £ 1.50/Friesian  AI. 
This represents  about  10% of the AI fee. In Denmark  they claim  the breeding  
programme  cost 22.6%  of the AI fee, in the Netherlands  38.8%,  and in France  
at least 39%.
Holsteins
In 1973, I reviewed  such evidence  as then existed  on the performance  of 
American  and Canadian  Holsteins  and their  crosses  in European  countries.  The 
data available  were not the best a mixture  of small scale, well-controlled  
experiments  and larger  scale analyses  of field data. However,  a consistent  
picture  emerged  from the twelve  reports  I was able to assemble  from several  
countries.  This was that the US strain  appteared  to be about  5% higher  in milk 
production  than the Canadian,  and more than 20% higher  than the European.  
There  was less information  on the beef side, and what there  was indicated  no 
penalties  on growth  rate  but some  or. carcass  merit.  These  results  were  presented  
at a meeting  of this Association  in 1974.
In the same  year,  with  encouragement  from  the editor  of the Farmers'  Journal,  
Waterford  Co-op  decided  to finance  an experimental  importation.  The original  
idea was to import  from the US, and in preparation  for this we did an interesting  
computer  search  of over half a million  cows  in the north-eastern  United  States  
to preselect  heifers  for import. We emphasised  milk production,  but also the 
improvement  of butterfat  percentage  and the avoidance  of the extremely  large  
framed  and angular  models  of the Holstein.  In the event,  because  of blue  tongue  
disease,  the focus  was shifted  to Canada  and 30 pedigree  Holstein  heifers  were  
selected  in Ontario  in September  1974 for importation.  Two of them survived  
the various  quarantine  stages  and calved  down in Coolnakilla  in 1975. A 
matching  group  of 25 pedigree  Irish Fnesians  was selected  and a further  group  
of comparable  commercial  Friesian  heifers  was  assembled,  partly  from  Moorepark  
replacement  heifers. The three groups  were run together  during 1975 at 
Coolnakilla  and in the subsequent  three years at Waterford  Co-op's  farm at 
Castlelyons.
The trial was far  from  perfect,  mainly  because  of the very different  treatment  
of the Holsteins  in the rearing  and pre-calving  period. However,  the results  
confirmed  our expectations.  The pedigree  and commercial  groups  were very 
similar,  while  the Holstein  group  gave  7%, 13%,  25% and 36% higher  yields  in 
their first four lactations.  Though  fat percenuge  was consistendy  lower,  fat 
yields  were  3%, 10%, 14% and 24%  higher.  The Holsteins  were  slighdy  faster

years  has been Holstein  and the Holstein  content  of the Approved  Bull list is 
about  25% and climbing  year by year. Everywhere  else in Europe,  they have  
essentially  taken  over  at this stage.  There  is vehement  opposition  from  those  who 
have to rear the bull calves  but the realities  are, first, that they are generally  
different  people  from those  who make  the breeding  decisions,  and second,  that 
because  of the high level  of beef  crossing,  the Friesian  and Holstien  bull calves  
make  up only  25% of all our beef  animals  (Table  4). The movement  to Holstein  
is simply  part  of the drive  for higher  biological  efficiency  and  higher  profitability  
in milk produciton  (see Figure  2).
New  technology
AI arrived  on the scene  40 years  ago and has transformed  cattle  breeding  here 
and in other  developed  countries.  Embryo  technology  was perfected  about  10 
years ago and it has also had major  effects,  though  in a more  restricted  area. 
About  75% of all young  bulls  recruited  for AI are now being  produced  by ET.
The new techniques  now  being  developed  include  sexing  of semen,  sexing  of 
embryos,  mass  production  of embryos  by IVF  (in vitro  fertilisation),  and finally,  
cloning  of embryos.  In Figure  3,1 have  attempted  to put  these  in persp^tive.  The 
real question  is not whether  they are feasible,  but whether  they  are likely  to be 
competitive  with the existing  AI technology.

Sexed  semen  would  clearly  be a major  benefit.  It would  put an end,  once  and 
for all, to the dual-purpose  argument.  Specialised  replacement  heifers  would  be 
Holstein  or the equivalent,  and  all other  calves  would  be beef  cross  and  male.  IVF 
embryos  have b^n around  for a year or two, but there  is difficulty  achieving  
acceptable  success  rates  at reasonable  cost. Pre-sexing  of these  is now  becoming
22
feasible  and that will certianly  add io their value,  though  whether  it will be 
sufficient  to make  them competitive  with AI is doubtful.  For the specialised  
purposes  now served  by conventional  embryo  production,  pre-sexing  wiU un­
doubtedly  be worth  the extra  effort.
Cloning  of embryos  (i.e. sub-division  of embryos  to make  many  identical  
copies  of the individual)  has now been achieved  on an experiemental  scale. If 
costs  can be reduced  and field  success  rates  increase,  it will undoubtedly  replace  
a lot of the conventional  AI business.  A version  of cloning,  called  Stem-Cell  
Multiplicadon,  offers  the  prospect  of achieving  this,  at least  in theory.  When  this 
technology  matures,  it will give us the possibility  of implanting  a very specific  
genotype  into each cow. I am confident  that at that stage  we will be looking  
beyond  highly  selected  pure-bred  genotypes  to take advantage  of some  of the 
benefits  in viability,  performance  and longevity  which  hybrid  animals  undoubt ­
edly possess.

Crossbreeding  in the Dairy  Herd  - 
Coping  with Calving  Problems
J. F. MEE
Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
The  increased  use of specialised  beef  breeds  as terminal  sires  in the dairy  herd 
has accentuated  farmers'  awareness  of the variation  in calving  problems  both 
between  and within  beef breeds. However,  the fear of increased  calving  
problems  is still the primary  deterrent  to more  widespread  usage  of continental  
beef breeds  in the national  dairy herd. Traditionally,  the Hereford  was the 
dominant  beef breed  and remained  so until the 1980's  when a swing  to the 
continental  breeds  took place  (Fig. 1).
The effects  of beef crossbreeding  in the dairy heard on production  and 
reproduction  have  recently  been  reviewed  by More  O'Ferrall  and Ryan  (1988,  
1990). It was concluded  that sire breed had no significant  effect  on mean  
lactation  milk,  fat or protein  yield  or lactation  length,  in thecurrent  or subsequent  
lactation.  The calving  to conception  interval  was significantly  longer  for Sim- 
mental  sired  calves  compared  with Charolais  and Hereford  sired  calves  which  
was in turn significantly  longer  than that  of Friesian  calves.  The  calving  interval  
of Simmental  and Limousin  sired calves  was significantly  longer  than that of 
Charolais  and Hereford  sired  calves  which  was  in turn  longer  than  that  of  Friesian  
calves  (More  O'Ferrall,  1987).
The objective  of this paper  is to outline  the nature  and extent  of the calving  
problems  associated  with beef crossing  in the dairy herd and to examine  how 
these  problems  may be ameliorated  by good  management.

Calving  problems
Recent  calving  surveys  and crossbreeding  trials  in Ireland  and the UK have  
quantified  the current  differences  between  breeds  and between  sires within  
breeds  (More  O’Ferrall,  1987; Anon.,  1988/89;  Anon.,  1990; Mee & Dings,  
1990).  In general  calving  difficulty,  gestation  length  and calf  mortality  increase  
as breed  size increases  except  for die Limousin  and Blonde  D'Aquitaine  breeds  
which  tend to have  a longer  gestation  length  than expected  from the sire breed  
size. Although  the continental  breeds  generally  have a higher  rate of calving  
difficulty  than traditional  breeds,  (approximatley  two to three  times  greater),  it 
is now  possible  to choose  sires with lower  calving  difficulty  figures  than those  
of Hereford  sires  even  though  the continental  sire  breed  average  has not  changed  
over the years.
The primary  calving  problems  associated  with crossbreeding  are those  
related  to increased  calf birth weight,  i.e. calving  difficulty,  calf mortality  and 
prolonged  gestation.  Calving  difficulty  is mainly  associated  with  relative  foetal  
oversize  and malpresentations  but also with poor maternal  preparation  for 
calving  and environmental  factors  (Table  1). Relative  foetal  oversize  due to 
crossbreeding  is inherently  determined  by hereditary  factors  such as breed,  sire,  
sex and gestation  length but is also modulated  by environmental  factors  such  as 
precalving  nutrition,  parity  and season. Continental  crossbred  calves  have a 
significantly  higher  prenatd  growth  rate than traditional  British  beef  breeds  but 
their birth weight  has a relatively  low correlation  with posmatal  growth  rate.

The  consequence  of this elevated  birth  weight  is a higher  rate  of both assisted  
and  difficult  covings  (Tables  2,3).  While  the perinatal  mortality  rate  is generally  
also higher  for continental  sires  there  is large  variation  within  each  breed  (Table  
4). Prolonged  gestation  can be a serious  problem  with  certain  sires  causing  foetal  
oversize  and prolonging  the calving  interval.

Coping  with calving  problems.
1. Choice  of sire
In choosing  which  breed  and which  sire to crossbreed  a percentage  of the 
dairy  herd with,  calving  problems  must  rank as important  selection  criteria.  To 
aid selection  of sires  from A.I. centres  the Department  of Agriculture  and Food  
produce,  each spring,  a list of beef  sires with below  average  calvkig  difficulty  
rates (Anon.,  1990). When  comparing  breeds  a difference  in serious  calving  
difficulty  rate of 1.5% or greater  indicates  a significant  difference  between  
breeds,  while a difference  of 3.0% or greater  is required  for a significant  
difference  between  sires within a breed. Studies  conducted  at Moorepark

c Heifers  calvings
When  purchasing  a natural  service  sire one is dependent  upon  the grandsire's  
performance  and the appearance  of the bull before  an assessment  can be made  
on the herd. In order  to avoid  serious  problems  in the first year it is generally  
recommended  that unproven  sires  be used  selectively  on only a few older,  easy  
calving  cows  (Herron,  1989). Heifers,  second  calvers,  smaller  cows  and cows  
with a history  of calving  problems  should  not be crossbred  unless  the calving  
results  of the sire are below  the breed  average.  With  both  A.I.  and  natural  service  
sires it is essential  to keep  a record  of service  dates  as such data  may be needed  
if prolonged  gestation  is suspected  and induction  contemplated.
2. Precalving feeding.
Once a beef sire has been selected  prevention  of calving  problems  is now 
dependent  upon the  management  of the cow  during  pregnancy  and calving.  The 
effect  of precalving  nutrition  on calf  birth weight  and on calving  difficulty  has 
often  been  emphasized  in preventing  foetal  oversize.  Results  from  experiments  
in both dairy  and beef  cows suggest  only a minor  effect  of precalving  feeding  
level on calving  performance  (Drennan,  1979; Sejrsen  & Neimann-Sorensen,  
1979).  Two  thirds  of foetal  growth  occurs  during  the last trimester  of pregnancy  
while  at term the rate of prenatal  average  daily  gain slows  down  to 200-500  ^ 
day. Results  from  Teagasc  studies  on beef  cows  have  shown  that  unless  the cow 
actually  loses  body  condition  during  the latter  stages  of pregnancy  the foetus  will 
exercise  preference  for nutrients  and grow at the expense  of the cow. While  
problems  of obesity  at calving  may occur  with heifers  the problem  with cows

currently  is more  often  one of poor  body  condition  at calving  as 'steaming  up' 
precalving  is not widely  practised  due ot milk quota  restrictions.  Achieving  
optimum  body condition  score  at calving  (Table  6) may necessitate  restricting  
heifer's  silage  intake  and providing  supplementary  concentrate  feed for thin 
cows.
3. Calving  induction
At term problems  with cows  'going  overtime'  may be obviated  by inducing  
calving  at, or  preterm.  The commercial  regimes  currently  available  suffer  from 
a high incidence  of side effects  such as poor  udder  distension,  poor  preparation  
for calving,  retained  placentae,  and stillbirths.  An alternative  regime  developed  
at Belclare  Research  Centre  has shown  promising  results  in trials but is not 
commercially  available  (Diskin,  McEvoy  & Sreenan,  1989). Ideally  induction  
of calving  should  be practised  on a planned  basis  with  known  service  dates  and 
initiation  of the regime  some  14 days  before  the predicted  calving  date in order  
to achieve  a substantial  reduction  in birth  weight  Problem  with  prematurity  will 
arise if induction  is practised  more than one month  preterm  (O'Farrell  & 
Crowley,  1974). It should  be noted  that while  prolonged  gestation  may occur  
with individual  matings  within  all breeds  it is not a feature  of the traditional  
British  beef  breeds  nor of the Belgian  Blue or MRi breeds  (Table  7).

4. Calving  supervision
At calving  time it is recommended  that all calvings  be supervised,  but not 
necessarily  assisted,  irrespective  of the breed  of sire selected.  Being  present  at 
each  calving  enables  one to monitor  the course  of the normal calving,  correct  an 
abnormal  calving,  revive  a weak  calf,  disinfect  the navel  cord  and  feed  colostrum  
promptly.  Recently,  calving  aids have  been introduced  to make  more  efficient  
use of labour  during  the calving  season  both during  the day and at night  (Mee,  
1988). Studies  at Moorepark  have shown  no advantage  of premature  interven ­
tion during  the calving  process  and in fact this leads to increased  usage  of the 
calving  jack  and more  weak  calves  after  calving.  It is suggested  that heifers  be 
left to calve  undistrubed  for approximatley  2 to 3 hours  and cows  for approxi ­
matley  2 hours before  intervention  is contemplated.  Implementation  of this 
policy  at Moorepark  has reduced  the incidence  of unnecessary  interference
29
during  normal  calving.  While  comparable  studies  have  not  been  conducted  with 
crossbred  calvings  it is suggested  that  a similar  approach  to cal  ving  would  reduce  
the incidence  of calving  difficulty.
5. Caesarean  section
The question  of whether  or when  to perform  a caesarean  section  at a difficult  
calving  is one that needs  to be addressed  by the attending  veterinary  surgeon  
based  on the individual  circumstances  of the calving,  and in some  cases  the breed  
of sire. While  double  muscling  will not occur  in crossbred  calves  it presents  a 
problem  with embryo-transfer  calves  and this needs to be borne in mind if 
attempting  vaginal  delivery  by forced  extraction.  The caesarean  section  rate of 
double  muscled  breeds,  when  crossbred,  is similar  to that of other  beef  breeds.  
Current  studies  at Moorepark  are attempting  to predict  the degree  of calving  
difficulty  based  on the relationship  between  the size  of the calf  s legs  and  its body  
weight.  It is hoped  that  this index  may  be used  when  deciding  whether  to perform  
surgery  or deliver  the calf  per vaginum.
6. Calf  resuscitation
Even before  the calf is bom stimulation  of breathing  is often necessary  in 
cases of abnormal,  prolonged  or difficult  calvings.  Amniotic  fluid can be 
evacuated  manually  or using suction  devices  during  calving  (Mee,  1988).  Once  
the calf is bom,  brief  suspension  will drain  excess  fluid and establish  a patent  
airway. Stimulation  and maintenance  of a regular  respiratory  rhythm  may be 
effected  by the traditional  means  of prodding  a finger  into the calfs nostrils,  
throwing  cold water  over the calfs  head  or ventilating  the chest  by raising  ^d 
lowering  the rib cage  and upper  limb. If successful,  the calf  is then  placed  sitting  
up with both fore legs stretched  out in front to aid lung expansion.  Recently,  
'reviving  dmgs ’ and oxygen  have  been used to resuscitate  calves. Respiratory  
stimulatnts  are available  to farmers  as drops and gels (Dopram-V  drops,  
Dallophylline  gel) and oxygen  (£80/5  year  rent)  in the form  of industrial  gas (Air 
Products  Ltd. IIG Ltd.). Very  few controlled  trials  have  been  conducted  on these  
aids in calves  but experience  at Moorepark  indicates  oxygen  may  be suitable  for 
use on larger  farms.
The future
If current  breeding  trends  continue  there  will be a further  influx  of exotic  beef 
breeds  into the Irish national  herd  and further  growth  in Holstein  cross  Friesian  
cow numbers.  With the delay  between  the introduction  and the completion  of 
evaluation  of imported  breeds  under  Irish farm conditions  the present  problems  
will persist  unless  ongoing  research  is conducted  and the information  currently  
available  is applied.  Novel  approaches  to calving  problems  including  induction  
of calving,  prediction  of problems  and elective  surgery,  all r^uire  further  
research  before  widespread  application  of these techniques.  Milk quotas  are 
likely to limit production  for the future  and in this situation  maintenance  of 
income  through  achieving  efficiencies  in cost reduction  and the use of cross ­
breeding,  particularly  specialist  beef  breeds,  will be important.

Automated  Dairy  Herd  Management
E. O'CALLAGHAN  and K. O'FARRELL  
Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
During  the past decade  microcomputer  and videotest  systems  have had an 
increasing  impact  on dairy  herd management.  Major  developments  in process  
control  systems  have  been  made  by milking  machine  manufacturers,  initially,  as 
an aid to milking  parlour  automation.  More  recently  the trend  has been  to provide  
the farmer  with a sophisticated  management  information  and control  system  in 
which  data  are collected  automatically  and all feeding  operations  are controlled.
A comprehensive  computerised  dairy  herd  management  system  (Dairymis  5) 
has been developed  at Moorepark.  The data are presenUy  entered  via the 
keyboard  of a personal  computer.  A measurement  and control  system  has 
recently  been  developed  at Moorepark  for; (a) automatic  cow identification,  (b) 
automatic  milk yield recording  using electronic  milk meters,  (c) automatic  
control  of the amount  of concentrate  fed in the milking  parlour,  (d) automatic  
printing  of the code labels  for individual  cow milk samples.  When  milking  is 
completed,  the cow numbers  and corresponding  milk yields  are entered  auto­
matically  into the Dairymis  II system.
Automatic  cow identification
Electronic  animal  identification  systems  suitable  for the reliable  operation  of 
concentrate  dispensers  for dairy  cows  are now readily  available  from  multina ­
tional  companies  in most  countries.  Electronic  identification  for  data  acquisition  
in the milking  parlour  has developed  at a much  slower  rate. Part  of the problem  
with  automatic  data  acquisition  in the parlour  has been  the difficulty  in develop ­
ing a reliable  milk meter  and the time  required  to develop  software  but the main  
problem  has been in the performance  of animal  identification  systems  them ­
selves,  placed  in routine  use in the milking  parlour. Figure 1 shows the 
components  of the transponder  identification  system  used  at Moorepark.
Figure  1:
Components  of a transponder  system.

The transponder  is normally  in an inactive  or quiescent  state but when it 
comes  within  range  of the radio  frequency  field  produced  by the interrogating  
antenna,  it is activated  and transmits  its data  back  to the antenna.  The frequency  
used for data transmission  is generally  different  from the activating  frequency.  
The decoder  (sometimes  known  as the interrogator  or reader)  contains  a radio  
frequency  unit  (RFU)  capableof  generating  the appropriate  activating  signal  and 
converting  the signal  received  from the tag into a logic  level.

The components  of the measurement  and control  system  developed  at 
Moorepark  are:

to animal  identification  processing  equipment  located  in the milking  par­
lour. The  controller  manages  the control  devices  for all automatic  operations  
in the milking  parlour  and also measures  and captures  a wide range of 
associated  data including  animal  identification  and concentrate  
feeding  (Figure  2).

over  the head  of the cow in each stall. The antennae  are linked  to a decoder  
which  is linked  to the controller.
4. The controller  is linked  to a remote  computer  (IBM  compatible  personal  
computer)  located  in an office. The data  stored  in the controller  is commu ­
nicated  to the computer  at selected  intervals
Automation  Programmes
The total programme  is written  in two different  languages.  One part is in 
Macbasic,  the other  part is written  in Pascal.  The micromac  controls  all actions  
in the milking  shed and collects  all data. The programme  in the micromac  is 
written  in Macbasic  and collects  the following  data:
1. The signal  from the Eureka  decoder  which  sends  through  the tag number  of 
the cows.
2. The milk yield  of each cow.
3. The milk temperature.
4. The row in which  the cows  are located.
5. The unit in which  each cow is located.
The Pescal  programme  is used to manipulate  and print out the different  files 
saved  by the Macbasic  Programme.
Performance  of the electronic  identification  systems
The performance  of the Eureka  eartag  identification  system  was measured  
with  a walk-through  overhead  antenna  at the entrance  to the milking  parlour  and 
with  an individual  overhead  antenna  at each  feed  stall. The  walk  through  antenna  
had an identification  range  of 1 meter,  the range  of the individual  overhead  
antennae  was 50 cm. The antennae  were  connected  to three  multiplex  decoders.  
Commands  for operating  the decoders  were  incorporated  into the operation  pro­
gramme  for the data collection  system.  The perf^ormance  of the two types  of 
identification  systems  is summarised  in Table  1.

The primary  reason  for the low detection  rate with individual  antennae  was 
inconsistent  placement  of the cows  head and neck  relative  to the antenna.  With  
the walk through  system,  some  cows  lowered  their heads  when  walking  under  
the antenna  and the tag was outside  the 1 meter  detection  range.
In a further  experiment  in which  two antennae  were  used,  one overhead  and 
a corresponding  antenna  under  the concrete  floor  at the entrance  to the parlour,  
99-100%  of cows  were  consistently  delected  (Table  2).

Concentrate  feeding  and milk  recording
After  the cow has been identified  with  the walk through  system  concentrates  
are automatically  dispensed.  The controller  can be linked  to any make of 
concentrate  dispenser  and the quantity  fed is programmable.  It is proposed  to 
develop  an out-of-parlour  concentrate  feeding  system.
Automatic  milk  recording  is carried  out by linking  the release  solenoids  of the 
electronic  milk meter  to counters  in the controller.  Each  release  represents  0.2 
kg of milk. When  the clusters  are transferred  across  the pit an overhead  digital  
switch  in the centre  of the milkers  pit is activated:  the counter  on the controller  
is automatically  read and then zeroed  for the next cow.
Future  developments
A relatively  cheap,  reliable  and accurate  identification  is the key to future  
developments  such as:
(1) automatic  mastitis  detection
(2) automatic  heat detection
(3) automatic  alert of cows  with digestive  disorders  or other  illness
(4) automatic  fault  detection  in milking  machines.
Mastitis  detection  could  be based  on an in-line  detector  which  measures  the 
electrical  conductivity  of milk. A profile  can be built up for each cow and by 
using  "artificial  intelligence",  changes  can be interpreted.
It is possible  to use temperature  sensor  to measure  changes  in milk  tempera ­
ture which  reflect  changes  in body temperature.  When  a cow  is in heat  both  body  
and milk  temperature  rise by a small  amount.  A profile  of each  individual's  milk  
temperature  is drawn up and changes  from iis pattern  are detected  using  
artificial  intelligence  programmes.  This  can also be used  to alert  the milker  that 
a cow has a severe  infection  requiring  immediate  attention.  A similar  system  
monitoring  feed intake  and linked  to milk temperature  could  be used to detect  
digestive  upsets  or related  illness.
Today  in some  of the more  sophisticated  cars,  an automatic  system  checkout  
is earned  out once the iginition  key is inserted  Since  some  components  of a 
milking  machine  may be malfunctioning  without  any immediate  noticeable  
effect,  a similar  automatic  checkout  system  would  be a decided  advantage.  This 
and the other  elements  of the automated  package  could  be run through  the one 
computerised  system.

Beef Production  from Silages  Produced  
from  Italian  Ryegrass,  Perennial  Ryegrass  
and Permanent  Grassland  Swards.
T. KEATING  and P. O'KIELY  
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
This paper  presents  one year's  results  (1987)  from  a three  year (1987-1989)  
programme  of research  carried  out at Grange  Research  Centre. Three  sward  
types  were compared  under  intensive  silage  conservation  systems  and subse ­
quent  annual  beef  carcass  production  per hectare  was  measured,  when  the silages  
were  offered  to finishing  steers.
Grass  accounts  for 97% of ruminant  feed in Ireland,  with silage  comprising  
one quarter  of this total (Lee, 1988). The area under  grass,  including  rough  
grazing,  is 5.2 million  hectares  or 91% of the land area used for agricultural  
purposes  (C.S.O.,  1989). Most of the grassland  (approx.  85%) consists  of 
permanent  swards  and about  3% is reseeded  annually  (Collins  and Murphy,  
1978).  Most  of the permanent  swards  are of diverse  botanical  composition  with 
relatively  low levels of ryegrass  species. The contribution  of permanent  
grassland  to the national  silage  crop is likely  to be high,  reflecting  the overall  
predominance  of these  swards  evert  though  they  may  not  be inherently  suited  for 
quality  silage  production.  The  main  sown  species  is perennial  ryegrass  but sonie  
10% of the total sown is Italian ryegrass,  the latter being sown either in 
monoculture  as a specialist  silage  crop or mixed  with perennial  ryegrass  and 
sown  as mixtures  (Culleton  and Murphy,  1987). Accordingly,  an experiment  
was carried  out at Grange  to compare  reseeded  Italian  ryegrass  and perennial  
ryegrass  swards  with an pld permanent  grassland  sward to determine  the 
following:  »
1. annaal  grass  yield  and quality  when  each sward  was managed  in 
an intensive,  unwilted,  silage  conservation  system,
2. conservation  losses  and silage  quality,
3. silage  intake  and animal  performance  by cattle  offered  these  silages,

Sward  management and grass  conservation
The OPG was an old permanent  sward  (over  40 years)  of mixed  botanical  
composition  while  the IR and PR swards  were  sown  in the autumn  previous  to 
the experiment.  The swards  were  in large  replicated  field  plots  with  a total area
38
of 3 ha. for each sward. The cutting  schedule  was designed  to optimise  
production  of high quality  grass from each sward  and was based  on previous  
res^h  findings  at Grange.  Consequently,  there  were  5 cuts of IR and 4 cuts 
each  of  PR and OPG,  with  all cuts  ensiled  separately  (cutting  dates  given  in Table  
4). Grass  was cut with  a rotary  mower  and harvested  without  wilting.  Formic  
acid was applied  m all cases. Harvested  grass  was weighed  into the silos and 
silage  subsequently  weighed  out. ApplicaUons  of P and K feitilizers  were  
^rplus  to requirements  and were  based  on soil analysis  and estimates  of P and
K remov^.  The  total annualnitrogenapplication  was  430  kg N/ha  on all swards
with applications  spread  between  cuts as shown  in Table  1.

InDecember,aftertheharvestingseason,sevensods(178mmx51 mm)were
taken  at random  from  each  plot. Plant  species  were  separated  and tiller  numbers  
per m-' were  calculated  for each sward.
Animal  production
Ninety-seven  Fmsian  steers were used with 37, 31 and 29 steers being  
allocated  to ^e IR, PR and OPG silages  respectively.  Silages  were  offered  ad 
libitum  together  with  2 kg concentrates  per head  daily. The  4 or 5 cuts  from  each  
sw^d  were  fed in sequence  over  a period  of 127 days. Steers  were  group  penned  
in slated  floor  housing  and individual  intakes  recorded  for half the animals  on 
each treatment  Carcass  weights  were  recorded  post-slaughter.
Results  and discussion
Tiller  numbers  per m^ for swards  were  3336,8331  amd 7365  for IR, PR and 
OPG respecbvley.  The IR and PR swards  contained  80% and 93% Italian  
ryep-ass  and perennial  ryegrass  respectively,  while  the remaining  tillers  in each  
ot the two swards  were  mostly  annual  meadowgrass.  The OPG  sward  contained  
rough-stacked  m^dowgrass  (33%),  Bent  sp. (31%),  perennial  ryegrass  (15%)
meadow  foxtail  (11%) and other  species,  including  weeds (10%)
The IR sward outyielded  PR and OPG by 2.6 and 2 9 t grass DM/ha  
respectively  in its first year  after  sowing  (Table  2), while  maintaining  a similar  
overall  digesubihty.  The mean yield and digestibility  of PR and OPG were

similar,  indicating  that within  the systems  chosen  there  was no  apparent  benefit  
in terms  of grass  production  and quality  to replacing  the OPG  with  PR. Previous  
research  on comparisons  between  a similar  OPG  sward  and reseeded  IR and PR 
swards  showed  that the relative  dry matter  yield per ha. per annum  of IR 
compared  to OPG  can vary from 92 to 145%  and that of PR compared  to PPG  
from  94 to 113% (Collins,  1984  and 1985;  O'Kiely  and Hynn,  1986).  Culleton,  
Murohy  and McLoughlin  (1989)  at Johnstown  Castle  Rese^ch  Centre,  reported  
an increase  in DM yield  of 60% (9.3 to 14.9 to DM/ha)  in the first year after  
reseeding,  declining  to a 36% and 13% yield  advantage  in the 2nd and 3rd year,  
respectivley.  The results  of Culleton  (1989)  indicate  that the botanical  compo ­
sition of the old permanent  grassland  sward,  and particularly  the ryegrass  
content,  will influence  the response  in DM yield  to reseeding.  The  water  soluble  
carbohydrate  (WSC)  levels in the grass juice varied considerably  between  
swards  and within  cuts of swards.  The PR sward  consistently  had higher  WSC  
levels  than  the OPG  on similar  cutting  dates.  The  lactic  buffering  capacity  (LBC)  
and WSC  are major  factors  influencing  the ensilability  of grass  and the relation ­
ship between  silage  pH (Table  3) and grass  LBC  and WSC  is described  by the 
equation:
pH =0.013  LBC - 0.036  WSC -h4.4
with correlation  coefficient  (r) = 0.78
Silage  preservation  was satisfactory  for all cuts except  third cuts of PR and

OPG which preserved  badly (Table  3). The badly preserved  silages  were  
associated  with  two levels  of WSC  in the harvested  grass  and in the case  of PR, 
a particularly  high  LBC.  Wilson  and Collins  (1980) reported  that, over  a 4 year 
period,  97%  of IR silages  had a pH of 4.2 or lower  while  only 72% and 28%  of 
PR and PPG silages  respectivley  had a pH of 4.2 or lower. This indicates  that 
ryegrass  species,  and particularly  Italian  ryegrass,  are easier  to preserve  by 
ensilage  than grass  from old permanent  grassland  swards.
Similar  animal  performance  was  achieved  by steers  on each  of the three  sward  
treatments,  with no differences  being recorded  for any of the carcass  traits  
measured  (Table  4).

Carcass  gain  per  ha (Table  5) for  each  sward  was  calculated  using  grass  yields,  
in-silo  losses,  silage  intakes  and carcass  gain data. The kill-out  rate for steers  at 
the start  of the experiment  was assumed  to be 500g/kg.  The IR and PR swards  
produced  125 and  41 kg more  carcass  per ha, respectively,  than  the OPG  sward.  
However,  even  though  individual  animals  received  the same  amount  of concen ­
trates  daily,  there  was an additional  688 and 169 kg concentrates  per ha fed to 
steers  on the IR and PR swards,  respectivley,  than  on OPG,  because  they  carried  
more  animals.

If the relative  carcass  gain per ha were  predicted  from  grass  DM yields  and 
quality,  the benefits  of the IR compared  to the other two swards  would  be 
significantly  over-estimated  (Table  6). This supports  the conclusion  that the 
evaluation  of cultivars  of ryegrass  should  be assessed  in terms of animal  
productivity  (Ribeiro,  1984) and preferably  in terms  of carcass  gain (Steen,  
1984).

The margin  over  feed  per ha was calculated  for each  sward  and the costs  and 
returns  are given  in Table  7. The relative  differences  between  swards  in returns  
pier ha should  be the same  irrespiecti  ve of the price  pier kg. carcass.  However,  the 
costs  pier ha may v^  considerably  between  individual  circumstances  and thus 
influence  the margin  over feed.

For example,  the estimated  costs  of harvesting  1 tonne  grass  DM from each  
individual  cut is given  in Table  8. The 4th cuts of PR and OPG  are particularly  
expensive,  due to low DM yields,  and it is unlikely  that farmers  would  be 
prepared  to incur  these  high  harvest  costs.  The  net  result  of omitting  the final  cuts 
of PR and OPG  swards  would  be to reduce  carcass  output  per ha (as less grass  
ensiled)  when  compared  to the IR in the intensive  silage  conservation  systems  
used,  but the feed  costs  per  ha would  also  be reduced  (3 Vs 4 harvests).  The  grass  
used  for cut 4 of PR and OPG in this experiement  would  more  logically  be used  
for grazing  animals  on farms  at the latter  end of the grass  growing  season.

The margin  over feed for the IR and PR swards  must  also cover  the cost of 
reseeding.  This  cost,  in the case  of IR, could  be spread  over  three  years  (assuming  
it is necessary  to reseed  IR after three years),  and in the case of PR could  be 
spread  over six to seven  years.
Summary
* The IR sward  had greater  DM production  than  PR and OPG,  but at the cost 
of an additional  harvest.
43
* In-silo  losses  were  highest  for IR (24%)  and lowest  forOPG  (15%)  withPR  
(20%) intermediate.
*IRandPR  swards  produced  125 and  41 kg more  carcass  per ha respectively  
than OPG.
*For  intensive  silage  production,  resowing  OPG with ryegrass  is justified.
* Results  of one year  (1987)  only. However,  the 1988  results  confirmed  the 
benefits  of reseeding.

This paper  summarises  a research  programme  carried  out by J. P. Moran  
while a recipient  of the John Flood Memorial  Scholarship.  Within  the 
programme  various  aspects  of the microbiology  and  chemistry  of  ensiling  grass  
were studied.  The overall  objective  of the programme  was to improve  our 
understanding  of the contribution  of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB)  to silage  
fermentation  under  Irish conditions.
The enumeration  of LAB on grass,  silage  and farm  machinery,  
a) A survey  of LAB numbers  on standing  and harvested  crops  of grass  
between  May and September  1988.
Grass grown  for silage was sampled  19 times during  a 20 week period  
between  May and September  1988. The grass  was sampled  randomly  from a 
variety  of pastures  immediately  before  harvesting  (standing  crop)  and immedi-  
adey after harvesting  (grass  samples  as it left the forage  harvester).  A rotary  
mower  and precision  chop  harvester  were  used  throughout  the experiment.  The 
silage  additive  (acid)  applicator  was switched  off when  grass  for sampling  was 
being  harvested.  Total  counts  of LAB  on the standing  crop  as measured  on MRS 
agar  (Table  1) were  generally  quite  high  and ranged  from 10* to 10^ CFU/g  grass.
Levels  on the standing  crop were similar  to the harvested  crop. The high 
counts  of LAB delected  on the standing  crop are not in agreement  with those  
found by Stirling  and Whittenbury,  (1963);  Muck  and O'Connor  (1985)  or 
Fenton,  (1987). The high levels  found  may have been associated  with Irish  
weather  related  factors  (low UV radiation,  high relative  humidity,  etc.), crop 
factors  (dense  high moisture  crops),  management  factors  (animal  manures  and 
silage  effluent  applied  to silage  ground;  silage  ground  grazed  late in the year)  or 
may be due to a combination  of all these  factors.

The Identification  of a random  seltetion  of LAB  colonies  isolated  from  grass  
show^ the homofermentative  LAB to account  for 54% of total  isolates.  Of the 
homofementatives  87%  belonged  to the g&ms  Lactobacillus.  Heterofermenta-  
tive LAB accounted  for 32% of total isolates  with Leuconostoc  being the 
dominant  species,  accounting  for 78%  of heterofermentative  isolates.
(b) The enumeration  of LAB on different  plant  types.
Coimts  of LAB were earned  out on different  grass genera  and one clover  
genus  (Table  2). Counts  of LAB on  grasses  and clover  were  high with Agrostis  
species  giving  rise to highest  counts.  The increased  counts  on particular  genera  
of grass  may be a genus  only effect  or it may be due to any one of a number  of 
other  effects  such as plant  growth  stage, amount  of dead material  on the plant,  
local  plant  microenvironment,  plant  morphology,  or some  stimulatory  or inhibi-  
tary conditiohs/substances  on the plants.
(c) The enumeration  of LAB on different  plant  parts.
LAB were  enumerated  on different  plant  parts  (Table  2). Counts  ofLAB  on 
all plant  parts  and on the entire  plant  were  high  ranging  from l(f to 10’ CFU/g  
^ass.  Highest  counts  were  found  on the decaying  material  at the base  of the plant  
This finding  is in agreement  with that of Stirling  and Whiuenbury  (1963),  who 
suggested  that the presence  ofLAB  were  associated  with  the release  of nutrients  
from  damaged  or decaying  plant  tissue.  In addiUon  it could  be that  theconditions  
prevailing  at the ba^  of the plant  may  encourage  the growth  ofLAB  i.e. reduced  
penefraUon  by uv light,  and a more  moist  and humid  environment.
Stirling  and Whittenbury  (1963)  found  that no LAB colonies  developeil  on 
the inflorescence,  before  or after  seed formation.  However  in the experiment

carried  out here  very  high  numbers  were  detected  ranging  from lO’ to 10’ CFU/  
g grass. These  high numbers  may be a result  of the LAB locating  in micro ­
environments  among  the seeds,  thus  protecting  them from harsh  environmental  
conditions.  High  counts  ofLAB  have  also  been  detected  on com  seed  (Miskovic  
and Rasovic,  1972;  Koch,  Moruarid  and Kirchgessner  1973).
Lower  numbers  ofLAB  were  detected  on the leaves  of the grass.  This  would  
be expected  since  leaves  are usually  orientated  to achieve  maximum  interception  
of sunlight  and hence  uv radiation.  For this reason  the leaf  provides  very little  
protection  for the LAB. These  results  are in agreement  with Moon  and Henk  
(1980)  who found  few bacteria  on the surface  or the interior  of either  wheat  or 
alfalfa  leaves.
(d) The enumeration  of LAB on the cutting  and harvesting  equipment
Counts  of LAB were enumerated  on different  parts of the cutting  and 
harvesting  equipment  (Table  3) to determine  the feasibility  of an inoculation  
effect  by the mower  or harvester.  The high counts  of LAB  recovered  on some  
parts  of new,  previously  unused  machinery  was not expected.  The machinery  
was stored  in an area adjacent  to where  silage  was stored,  fed and transported  
regularly.  It may be that counts  of LAB had been high in this general  
environment.
The  same  machinery  was  sampled  again  after  being  in regular  use throughout  
the silage  making  season.  Counts  of LAB had increased  on all machine  parts  
except  the harvester  rollers.  Highest  counts  were  detected  on the harvester  chute.  
This was expected  since  this area was  coated  with  a mat of plant  fragments  and 
debris  which  could  be a medium  for LAB  survival  and  growth.  Increases  in LAB  
numbers  on machinery  after use have also been found  by Fenton  (1987)  and 
Stirling  and Whittenbury  (1963)  where  plant  sap collects  as a result  of chopping  
or laceration  of the plant  material.

Several  investigators  have  implicated  the forage  harvester  as a major  source  
of inoculation  of grass  (Gibson  et al., 1961;  Henderson,  McDonald  and  Woolford  
1972;  McDonald,  1976;  Muck  and O'Connor,  1985; Fenton,  1987). Muck  and 
O'Connor,  (1985)  working  with alfalfa  suggested  that inoculation  by the har­
vester  would  only be effective  if the number  on the unharvested  crop was less 
than 104 CFU/g  alfalfa
(e) The enumeration  of LAB  in large scale  farm  silos in the early  stages  
of ensilage.
Numbers  of LAB were  enumerated  in large  scale  farm silos during  the first 
48 hours  of ensilage  (Table  4). Overall,  counts  of LAB  were  found  to increase  
in a similar  manner  and  pattern  to that seen  in pipe  and test tube  silos. Treatment  
with formic  acid was found  to reduce  the initial  growth  rate of LAB. This may 
be due to its ability  to bring  about  a rapid  reduction  in pH and/or  its antimicrobi^  
properties  (Saue and Breirem  1969; Woolford,  1975b). Treatment  with L. 
plantarum  resulted  in a higher  initial  number  of LAB on the harvested  grass,  
however  the numbers  detected  after  forty  eight  hours  were  similar  to those  found  
on the untreated  control.

Effect  on silage  fermentation  of bacterial  inocula  under  varying  levels  of
sucrose  addition.
Perennial  ryegrass  (22g water soluble  carbohydrate/kg  grass juice) was 
harvested  with  a precision-chop  harvester  and  ensiled  in small  plastic  silos  (6 kg 
treated  grass  per silo). It was treated  with (1) no preservative  (NP),  (2) formic  
acid (850 ^g)  at 3.0 ml/kg  (FA),  (3) Lactobacillus  plantarum  at 10® colony  
forming  units  (CFU)/g  grass  (LP),  (4) sucrose  at 4 g/kg (S4),  (5) sucrose  at 8 ^ 
kg (S8), (6) combination  of LP and S4. Five  silos  per treatment  were  opened  and 
sampled  3,8, and 45 days  after  ensiling.
Forage  from treatment  NP and LP contained  6.5 (SE.07),  9.1 (SE.08),  
9.1 (SE .03) and 8.6 (SE.06),  and  6.8 (SE .09),  9.1 (SE .02),  9.1 (SE .03),  and 8.6

also increased  the initial  flow  rate of effluent.

Conclusions
New  information  elucidated  in this work  showed  that  LAB levels  on a range  
of grasses  in Ireland  were greater  than reported  elsewhere  (Stirling  and Whit-  
tenbury,  1963; Muck  and O'Connor,  1985;  Fenton,  1987),  that substrate  availa ­
bility in the early stages  of fermentation  can limit the ability  of an added  
inoculum  (L. plantarum)  to make  an obvious  contribution  to the silage  fermen ­
tation  pattern  and that inoculation  with other  LAB (L. buchneri)  could  predis ­
pose  a silage  to a clostridial  fermentation.
The information  provided  in the experiments  reported  here improves  our 
understanding  of the ensilage  process.  It demonstrated  that
♦ A poor  fermentation  should  not usually  occur  under  Irish conditions  due 
to a shortage  of LAB.
♦ Added  inocula  have a major  challenge  to overcome  (i.e. high indigenous  
LAB numbers)  if they are to dominate  silage  fermentation.
♦ Harvesting  grass  does  not increase  the count  of LAB  if the indigenous  levels  
on the grass  are high.
♦ Highest  counts  of LAB are found  at the base  of the plant  (in the dead  or 
decaying  material)  and are lowest  on the leaf.
♦ Of the isolates  identified,  Lactobacilli  were  the dominant  bacteria  on the 
grass (64%)  with the Leuconostocs  accounting  for 32%  of isolates.
♦ LAB  can survive  on new unused,  cutting  and harvesting  machinery  and are 
increased  following  use, particularly  in the harvester  chute.
♦ Substrate  availability  can limit  the ability  of an added  inoculant  (L. planta  
rum)  to make  an obvious  contribution  to the fermentation  pattern  in the early  
stages.
♦ Added  inocula  tend  to show  improved  fermentation  when  a readily  utilisable  
form  of substrate  is supplied  with  an inoculum  rather  than  relying  on the  grass  
having  a high WSC  content.
♦ Some  LAB treatments  can disimprove  the fermentation.
♦ Clostridia  can be active  even at a pH of 3.9.
The research  results  in this paper  have implications  for recommendations  for 
silage  making.
- It has been  proposed  by Satter  et al (1987)  that  inoculants  need  to be applied  
at a rate which  adds ten times  more  LAB than the number  of indigenous  
LAB, if they are to have the desired  effect  If this is the case then most  
inoculants  in Ireland  need very high bacterial  numbers  (or more  
aggressive/active  bacteria)  and an excellent  viability/shelf  life.
- bacterial  inoculants  will frequently  need a source  of added  fermentable  
carbohydrate  if they  are to have  a noticeable  effect  on fermentation  products.
- formic  acid can significantly  increase  the effluent  flow rate in the initial  
stages  of ensilage.
- silages  which reach a pH of 3.9 in the early stages of ensilage  can, 
under  unusual  conditions,  still undergo  a clostridial  fermentation.

Factors  Affecting  the Optimum  Level  
and Protein  Content  of Concentrates  for 
Finishing  Beef  Cattle
R. W. J. STEEN
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of  Northern  Ireland,  
Hillsborough,  Co. Down.
High quality  silage  is the cheapest  source  of winter  feed for beef cattle.  
However,  even with excellent  silage,  concentrate  supplementation  is still re­
quired during the finishing  period to maintain  sufficiently  high levels of 
performance  to exploit  the growth  potential  of most  types  of cattle. It has now 
been  clearly  shown  that  as the level  of concentrate  feeding  or the protein  content  
of concentrates  given  to beef  cattle  are increased  the responses  in performance  
to each additional  increment  of energy  or protein  decline,  giving  a curvilinear  
response  to additional  inputs. Consequently  a point  is reached  when  the value  
of the extra  weight  gain is equivalent  to the cost of the extra  energy  or protein  
required  to produce  it, and this  determines  the most  economic  input  of energy  and 
protein  for any given  type of animal.
In the past  responses  to additional  concentrates  or protein  have  been  measured  
almost  entirely  in terms  of the extra live-weight  or carcass  gain produced  by 
additional  inputs.  However  with  increasing  consumer  demand  for leaner  beef  it 
had become  vitally  important  that the effects  of varying  the energy  and protein  
intakes  of beef  cattle  be assessed  in terms  of changes  in carcass  composition  and 
the output  of lean meat  as well  as the responses  in live-weight  and carcass  gain. 
Consequently  a series  of experiments  have  been  carried  out at Hillsborough  over 
the past few years  to examine  the effects  of level  of concentrate  feeding  and the 
protein  content  of the concentrates  on the performance  and carcass  composition  
of finishing  beef  cattle.
Factors  affecting  the optimum  level of concentrate  feeding.
The optimum  input  of concentrates  for finishing  cattle  is determined  by a 
number  of factors  including  the growth  potential  of the cattle,  the quality  of the 
basal  silage  diet and the overall  economics  of beef  production.
Effect  of the growth  potential  of the cattle
The  potential  of beef  cattle  for growth  and lean meat  deposition  varies  greatly  
depending  on the breed  and sex of the animal.  In experiments  at Hillsborough  
which  have  examined  the effects  of level  of concentrate  feeding  on performance  
and carcass  composition,  heifers  which  were crosses  of the continental  beef 
breeds  were  used  to represent  cattle  of low  growth  potential  and  continental  cross  
Friesian  bulls  were  used to represent  animals  of high growth  jx)tential.  Ninety  
heifers  which  were initially  about  13 months  old and 360 kg. live weight  were

given high digestibility  (dry matter  digestibility  722 g/kg), well preserved  
silages  ad libitum  and 0.6,2.4  or 4.2 kg of barley-based  concentrates  per head  
daily for 150 days.
The  effects  of concentrate  input  on performance  and carcass  composition  are 
given  in Table  1. Increasing  concentrate  input  from 0.6 to 2.4 kg/day  produced  
relatively  large  responses  in both live-weight  and carcass  gain, 150 and 140 ^ 
day resjjectivley  and approximately  half  of the extra  carcass  weight  gain was in 
the form  of lean meat. Consequendy  an extra  37 g of lean meat  were  produced  
for each extra  kg of concentrates  consumed,  or 27 kg extra  concentrates  were  
required  to produce  one extra  kg of lean meat. However  when  concentrate  input  
was  further  increased  from  2.4 to 4.2 kg/day  responses  in live-weight  and  carcass  
gain were  much  lower  than those  obtained  from the first increment  of concen ­
trates  and only 30% of the exua carcass  weight  was in the form of lean meat.  
Consequently  over  this  range  26 kg of concentrates  were  required  to produce  one 
kg extra  carcass  weight  and 82 kg extra  concentrates  were  required  to produce  
one extra  kg of lean meat,  which  is a very  poor  response  and would  certainly  be 
uneconomical  if producers  were paid for cattle  on the basis  of the lean meat  
content  in the carcass.
In subsequent  studies  continental  cross  Friesian  bulls  which  were  initially  13 
months  old and 440 kg live weight  were given  similar  high digestibility  (dry 
matter  digestibility  743 g/kg)  well  preserved  silages  as those  given  to the heifers.  
Silages  were  offered  ad libitum  and supplemented  with 2.6,3.8,5.0  and 6.2 kg 
barley-based  concentrates  (90%  barley/10%  soyabean  meal)  for 150 days. The 
effects  of increasing  concentrate  input  on performance  and carcass  compositon  
are shown  in Table  2. Again  the responses  in both live-weight  and carcass  gain 
to additional  concentrates  declined  progressivley  with each additional  incre ­
ment of concentrates.  However  responses  were much greater  than those  
obtained  with heifers. For example,  when bulls were given 2.6 to 5.0 kg

concentrates/day  the proportion  of concentrate  dry matter  in the diet  was similar  
to ^at when  heifers  were  given  2.4 to 4.2 kg/day,  yet the response  in carcass  
weight  gain to extra  concentrates  over these  ranges  was 40% greater  for bulls  
than for heifers. Furthermore,  a high proportion  (61%)  of the extra carcass  
weight  produced  in bulls  when  concentrate  input was increased  was in the form  
of lean meat Consequently  when  the concentrate  intake  of bulls  was increased  
from  2.6 to 5.0 kg/day  the increase  in the rate of lean meat  production  (40 g/kg.  
additional  concentrates)  was  over  three  times  greater  than the increase  obtain(  12 
g/kg additional  concentrates)  when the concentrate  intake  of heifers  was in­
creased  form  2.4 to 4.2 kg/day  (i.e. the same  range  of forage: concentrate  ratios).
These  results  clearly  show that in terms of both animal  performance  and 
carcass  composition  the optimum  input of concentrates  is much higher  for 
animals  of high  growth  potential  than for those  of low growth  potential  although  
the data for bulls and heifers  have been obtained  in different  experiments.  
However,  this impertant  interaction  between  the effects  of  plane  of nutrition  and 
the growth  potential  of the animal  has again  been  clearly  demonstrated  in sub- 
^quent  studies  at Hillsborough  in which  direct  comparisons  were  made  involv ­
ing bulls,  s^rs  and heifers  in the same  experiment.  In this case.  Continental  
cross  Friestian  bulls,  steers  and heifers,  all of which  were  initially  12 months  old 
were  given  a complete  diet  containing  two  thirds  high  digestibility  silage  and  one 
third  barley-based  concentrates  on a dry matter  basis.  Half  of the animals  of  each  
sex were  given  the dieta<i  while  the intake  of the other  half  was  restricted
to 80% of ad libitum  intake. The results  are summarised  in Table  3.
Responses  in carcass  gain to additional  food  were 169,100  and 92 g per kg 
dpf matter  for bulls,  steers  and heifers  respiectively . Furthermore,  the pjropwrtion  
of the extra  carcass  gain which  was lean meat  was 55% in bulls,  49% in steers  
and only 30% m heifers.  Consequently,  the responses  in the production  of lean 
meat  to additional  food  were  90,49  ad 28 g per  kg dry matter  for bulls,  steers  and 
heifers  respiecti  vley , the response  in bulls  being  just  over  three  times  the response  
m heifers,  as in the previous  studies.

Effect  of silage  quality
The response  in the performance  of beef  cattle  to additional  concentrates  is 
also greatly  influenced  by the quality  of the silage  available  to the cattle. The 
interaction  between  the quality  of the basal silage  diet and the response  to

supplementary  concentrates  has  been  examined  in a number  of experiments.  The 
results  of two of these  are summarised  in Table  4. In these  experiments  steers  
which  were  initially  580 kg live weight  and had been  implanted  with  hormonal  
growth  promoters  were  given  average  (D-value  630  g digestible  organic  matter/  
kg DM)  or high  quality  (D-value  707 g digestible  organic  matter/kg  DM)  silages  
ad libitum  for 80 days. Each  silage  was  supplemented  with  2.5 or 5.0 kg per head  
daily  of barley-based  concentrates.  The responses  in carcass  weight  gain  when  
concentrate  input was increased  from 2.5 to 5.0 kg were 95 and 65 g/kg 
concentrate  for the average  and high  digestibility  silages  respectively.  However  
a number  of experiments  have  shown  that responses  to concentrates  have  been  
approximately  30%  lower  with  non-implanted  steers  than  with  implanted  steers.  
Consequently  responses  of 66 and  45 g carcass  weight/kg  concentrates  would  be 
expected  over this range  with average  and high quality  silages  respectively.  
These  are in close  agreement  with those  obtained  in other experiments.  For 
example,  Drennan  (1984)  obtained  a response  of 52 g carcass  gain/kg  concen ­
trates  when  the concentrate  intake  of steers  given  fairly  good  quality  silages  was 
increased  from  19 to 34%  of total  dry matter  intake,  and in the data  given  in Table  
1 a response  of 39 g carcass  weight  gain  per kg concentrates  was obtained  when  
the concentrate  intake  of heifers  was increased  from 28 to 47% of total DM 
intake.

Taken  together  these  results  indicate  that the optimum  input  of concentrates  
for non-implanted  steers  and heifers  of average  growth  potential  is likely  to be 
of the order  of 20 to 25% of total DM intake  for high quality  silages  and 35 to 
40% of total DM intake  for medium  quality  silages.  However,  these  levels  are 
much  lower  than those  currently  used on many  farms.
The  interaction  between  silage  quality  and  concentrate  input  on a total  system  
basis  has l^n  further  examined  in a series  of six experiments  (Steen,  1988a).  In 
these  studies  a traditional  2-cut  system  of silage  making  was compared  with a 
more intensive  3-cut  system  using  perennial  ryegrass  swards. Cutting  dates,  
yields  of grass  and silage  digestibilities  are given  in Table  5. The two systems  
were  designed  to provide  equal  quantities  of aftermath  grazing  in the autumn.  
The silages  were  given  to 380 finishing  steers  for a mean  period  of 150 days.  
When  the silages  from  both systems  were  supplemented  with  2.45 kg. concen-  
trates/head  daily,  those  ^ven the 3-cut  silage  gained  0.22 kg/day  or 41% more  
c^cass  gain  than  those  given  the 2-cut  silage.  Consequently,  a concentrate  input  
of 4.9 kg/head  daily  was required  with the 2-cut  silage  to sustain  the same  level  
of carets  gain as that sustained  by the 3-cut  silage  supplemented  with  2.45  kg/ 
head  daily. However  the higher  intake  of the 3-cut  silage  reduced  the number  of 
cattle  finished/ha  of grass  ensiled  by 25%  compared  to when  the 2-cut  silage  was 
supplemented  with  the higher  input  of concentrates,  but it reduced  the quantity  
of concentrates  required  for the cattle  finished  on one hectare  of silage  by 62%.
With the current  shortage  of cattle  for finishing  in Ireland  and the overall  
economics  of beef  production,  finishing  9.4 cattle  from  a hectare  of silage  using  
3.5 tonnes  of concentrates  is likely to be much more economical  for the 
forseeable  future  than feeding  12.6 cattle  from a hectare  of silage  using  9.3 
tonnes  of concentrates.  Altemativley,  the use of an extra  2.4 hectares  of silage  
for  every  100  cattle  finished  over  the 150  day  winter  period  would  enable  the high 
quality  silage  and low input  of concentrates  to be used  rather  than the average  
quality  silage  and the high input  of concentrates,  with a saving  of 37 tonnes  of 
concentrates,  again  the high  quality  silage  system  being  much  more  economical.

Factors  affecting  the optimum  protein  content  in concentrates
The use of high-protein  concentrates,  especially  those  of low degradability,  
to improve  the performance  of finishing  cattle  offered  silage-based  diets has 
been the subject  of widespread  research  over the past few years  especially  in 
Great  Britain.  However,  most  of these  experiments  have involved  implanted  
cattle  which  have a higher  potential  for growth  and lean meat  deposition  than 
non-implanted  animals.  Consequently,  the response  to additional  protein  in the 
diet has been shown  to be lower in non-implanted  cattle than in implanted  
animals  (Steen  1988b).
Effects  with steers
In view  of the current  ban on the use of hormonal  growth  promoters  a series  
of six experiments  have  been  carried  out to examine  the effects  of supplementing  
silage-based  diets with protein  for non-implanted  steers. The silages  were  all 
well preserved  with protein  contents  ranging  from 112 to 173 g/kg DM and 
digestibilities  from 656 to 734 g digestible  organic  matter/kg  DM. In each  
experiment  the silages  were  supplemented  with 2.4 to 3.0 kg per head  daily  of 
either  mineralised  barley  or with  mixtures  of barley  and soyabean  meal  or barley  
and fish meal  containing  approximately  170 g crude  protein/kg  for periods  of 98 
to 155 days. Increasing  protein  intake  did not affect  silage  intake  or animal  
performance  but significandy  increased  carcass  fatness,  these effects  being  
consistent  across  the six experiments  (Table  6). The significant  increases  in

carcass  fat classification,  subcutaneous  fat depth  and marbling  score  (assessed  
in the cut surface  of the eye-muscle  at the 10th  rib) with  increasing  protein  intake  
are particularly  important  in view of the current  demand  fw leaner  beef.
Effects  with heifers
A series  of four  experiments  have  been  carried  out to examine  the effects  of 
increasing  the protein  content  of barley-based  concentrates  given  with  silage  to 
continental  cross  finishing  heifers.  Well  preserved  silages  of medium  to high 
digestibility  (642  to 734 g digestible  organic  matter/kg  DM)  were  supplemented  
with  0.5 to 4.5 (mean  2.5)  kg/head  daily  of either  barley  or mixtures  of barley  and 
soyabean  meal  (204  g crude  protein/kg).  The  results  are summarised  in Table  7. 
Increasing  the protein  content  of the concentrates  from 96 to 204 g/kg did not 
affect the performance  of the heifers  or carcass  fatness  as indicated  by fat 
classification,  subcutaneous  fat depth,  marbling  score  or the contents  of saleable  
meat  and fat trim when  the carcasses  were  boned  out commercially.  However,  
increasing  the protein  content  of the concentrates  significantly  reduced  the lean 
content  and increased  the fat content  of the fore-rib  joint  as determined  by total 
dissection  into  separable  lean,  fat and  bone.  Nevertheless,  the  detrimental  effects  
of increasing  protein  intake  on carcass  fatness  were  less pronounced  and were  
more  variable  in heifers  than in steers,  even though  heifers  would  generally  be 
considered  to have  a lower  growth  potential  and consequently  a lower  require ­
ment  for protein  than steers.
Effects  with bulls
The b^ on the use of hormonal  growth  promoters  in the EC has resulted  in 
renewed  interest  in Northern  Ireland  in the use of bull beef i)roduction  as a 
method  of producing  lean  beef  efficiently.  Consequently,  two  experiments  have

of performance  for bulls  in experiment  2 than for those  in experiment  1 is likely  
to have  been  due to the fact that in experiment  2 they were  at pasture  during  the 
previous  summer  and had a lower  level  of performance  and consequently  would  
have  exhibited  compensatory  growth  during  the experimental  period  while  those  
used  in experiment  1 were  indoors  throughout  their  lives  and had a high  level  of 
performance  prior  to the experiment  Orskov  etal  (1976)  found  that  sheep  which  
were  exhibiting  compensatory  growth  had a higher  requirement  for additional  
protein  than  those  which  had  previously  been  on a high  plane  of nutrition.  Similar  
effects  to those  obtained  with bulls have also been obtained  previously  with 
implanted  steers  (Steen  1988c).  When  soyabean  meal  was included  in a diet  of 
silage  and barley  there  was no response  in the performance  of steers  with  a live- 
weight  gain of 1.1 kg/day.  It would  therefore  appear  that for a given  type of 
silage,  responses  in the performance  of finishing  cattle  to additional  protein  are 
likely  to be closely  related  to the growth  potential  of the cattle.
The experiments  described  so far have involved  well preserved  silages  of 
medium  to high digestibility.  However,  the protein  in poorly  preserved  silages  
is not utilized  as well by beef cattle  as the protein  in well preserved  silages.  
Consequently,  in a recent  experiment  involving  young,  growing  cattle the 
response  in performance  when  poorly  preserved  silage  (204 g ammonia-N/kg  
total  N) was  supplemented  with  barley  and  soyabean  meal  rather  than  with  barley  
was twice  as large as the response  obtained  with a comparable  well preserved  
silage  (61 g ammonia-N/kg  total  N). There  is also limited  eyidence  to show  that 
positive  responses  to additional  protein  may be obtained  ih the performance  of 
non-implanted  finishing  steers  and heifers  when  silages  when  a low digestibil ­
ity and a low protein  content  are used.
Conclusions
The experimental  evidence  available  would  indicate  that when finishing  
steers  or heifers  are given  well  preserved  silages  of medium  to high  digestibility,  
increasing  the protein  content  of concentrates  above  lOOg/kg  will not improve  
animal  performance  and is likely to increase  carcass  fatness. However  with 
young  bulls or with steers with an exceptionally  high growth  rate, due to 
compensatory  growth  being exhibited,  increasing  protein  intake  is hkely to 
produce  some  improvement  in performance  without  affecting  carcass  composi ­
tion. Similarly,  when  badly  preserved  silages  or low digestibility  silages  with  a 
low protein  content  are used  a positive  response  in performance  may  be obtained  
to additional  protein  with most  types  of finishing  cattle.

The importance  of weight  gain for economic  success  in winter  finishing  
cannot  be overemphasised.  A daily  liveweight  gain increase  of 0.1 kg amounts  
to 15 kg over a 5 month  feeding  period  or 8 kg of additional  carcass  valued  at 
about  £20. Level  and protein  content  of concentrates  fed with  silage  to different  
breeds  and sexes  are discussed  in the previous  paper  by R. Steen.  The objective  
of the present  article  is to discuss  concentrate  feeds  and feeding  management  for 
finishing  animals
Accommodation  and feeding
To avoid  any reduction  in animal  performance  it is important  to provide  
suitable  accommodation.  In this respect  ptoints to be considered  include:  
avoiding  overstocking  on slats,  in cubicle  sheds  ensuring  adequate  cubicle  size, 
and in straw bedded  sheds the provision  of adequate  bedding. Maximum  
performance  on any diet can only  be achieved  by providing  unrestricted  access  
to the diet. For concentrate  feeing  this involves  the provision  of adequate  
feeding  space  so that all animals  can readily  feed at the same time. The area 
where  errors  most  often  arise  is that of providing  unrestricted  access  to silage.  
This  is almost  impossible  when  complete  reliance  is on self  feeding  from  the pit 
as it is very difficult  to ensure  umestricted  intake while at the same time 
attempting  to avoid  silage  losses.  Where  self  feeding  is practised  it is necessary  
to also  provide  a certain  amount  of easy  feeding  (e.g. round  feeders).  With  easy 
feeding,  edible  silage  should  be available  to the animal  at all times. This means  
discarding  inedible  material  prior to feeding  and frequent  removal  (twice  
weekly)  of deteriorated  silage  from the troughs.
Introduction  to concentrates
A considerable  quantity  of home  grown  barley  is now stored  and fed on the 
farm. This  practice  makes  good  economic  sense  and will probably  become  more  
prevalent  in the future. It is also likely  that some  of this barley  will be replaced  
by wheat  Where  high levels  of concentrate  (or roots)  feeding  is practised  there  
is a danger  of digestive  upsets  or acidosis  (accumulation  of lactic acid in the 
rumen  and a drop in rumen  pH accompanied  by going  off feed and scouring).  
This normally  occurs  during  the introductory  period  and can be avoided  by 
observing  the following  precautions  :
1. Gradual  introduction  to concentrates  (increase  by one-third  kg daily) . 
Feed  concentrates  twice  rather  than once  daily.
Use rolling  or coarse  grinding.
Ensure  free availability  of roughage  during  the introductory  period.

If fed concentrates  to appetite  it is essential  to ensure  that once  animals  have  
reached  the ad libitum  feeing  level following  gradual  introduction,  concen ­
trates  are subsequenUy  freely  available  at all times.
In practice,  where  mixing  facilities  are not available,  different  concentrate  
sources  (also  protein  and mineral/vitamin  supplements)  can be satisfactorily  fed 
by spreading  them separately  (and evenly)  along the feeding  trough. It is 
recommended  to avoid  sudden  changes  in the diet; if concentrates  are changed  
during  the feeding  period  this should  be done  gradually.
Method  of feeding  concentrates
Most  winter  cattle  feeding  operations  in Ireland  involve  grass  silage  fed to 
appetite  and the daily  allowance  of concentrates  given  in one of two feeds.  Only  
a relatively  small  proportion  of the larger  units have facilities  for feeding  the 
silage  and concentrates  as complete  diets. In one study,  once  daily  feeding  of a 
barley  based  concentrate  with silage  to appetite  was compared  with mixed  diets  
at low and high concentrate  feeding  levels. No differences  between  the two 
feeding  methods  were  evident  at the low (2.7  kg per  day)  concentrate  level  (Table  
1). However,  at the high  (5.2  kg per day)  level  of concentrates  daily  carcass  gains  
were  0.08  kg per day higher  where  the mixed  diet  was  fed compart  with  feeding  
concentrates  once  daily. In general,  the results  of studies  show  that  the expected  
improvements  in animal  performance  from  mixed  diets  as opposed  to separate  
feeding  of concentrates  and silage  are less than obtained  in this study.  In further  
studies  animals  were fed grass silage  to appetite  plus 6 kg of a barley  based  
concentrate  daily  in one of two feeds.  There  was  no effect  of treatment  on silage  
intake  but the daily  carcass  gains  were  0.027  kg higher  for those  fed concentrates  
in twos  as opposed  to one feed  daily  (Table  2). This  amounts  to an improvement

of about 4 kg of carcass  over a 150 day winter  period  from feeding  the 
concentrates  in two rather  than one feed dily. Prior  to each of these studies  
concentrates  were  introduced  gradually  and during  the introductory  periods  the 
daily  concentrate  allowances  were  given  in two feeds. Thus,  following  careful  
introduction  once  daily  feeding  of concentrates  is satisfactory  for finishing  cattle  
offered  silage  and up to 3 kg of concentrates  daily. However,  where  5 to 6 kg of 
concentrates  are fed daily with silage,  a small  but consistent  improvement  is 
evident  when  twice  rather  than once daily feeding  of concentrates  is practised.  
Purchase  of a complete  diet feeder  could  not be justified  in terms  of expected  
improvements  in animal  weight  gain even at high concentrate  feeding  levels  
when  compared  with twice  daily  feeding  of concentrates.
Processing  of grains
When  home  grown  (or purchased)  grains  are used  they are generally  either  
rolled  or ground  prior  to feeding.  Irrespective  of the processing  method,  it is 
important  that the outer  indigestible  portion  of each grain  is damaged  to ensure  
access by the rumen microbial  population  to the digestible  inner pxirtion.  
However,  fine grinding  is not necessary  and is in fact undesirable  due to 
increased  losses  of the finer  particles  and lack  of the fibre  characteristics  which  
would  be important  particul^ly  at high feeding  levels. A comparison  of rolled  
barley  and wheat  with the whole  grains  in grass  silage  based  diets  showed  that 
the dry matter  digestibility  of the rolled  and whole  grains  were  80.0%  and  42.5%  
respectively  (Table  3). These  results  clearly  demonstrate  that feeding  barley  or 
wheat  (or oats)  with even  a small  proportion  of undamaged  grains  can result  in 
an unacceptable  reduction  in grain digestibility  and consequently  in animal  
performance
Treating  grain  with sodium  hydroxide
Treatment  of whole  gram  with  sodium  hydroxide  has been  examined  recently  
as an alternative  to rolling  or grinding.  Sodium  hydroxide  treated  grain  has the 
advantage  that it can be stored  at a high  moisture  content  without  deterioration  
^d thus  drying  is not necessai^.  In one study  at Grange  fresh  barley  was mixed  
in a Keenan  Easi feeder with sodium  hydroxide,  following  which it was 
deposited  on a concrete  floor.  The  grain  was  disturbed  eight  hours  later  and  again  
after a couple  of days to avoid  setting  in a solid mass. When  compared  in a 
digestibility  study  to diets  consisting  of approximately  50 percent  grass  silage  
the digestibility  of the sodium  hydroxide  treated  grain  was 9 digestibility  units  
lower  than rolled  barley  (Table  4). Thus,  based  on this investigation  sodium

ALTERNATIVES  TO BARLEY  
Quality  of concentrates  fed with silage
The  standard  energy  source  used  as a supplement  to grass  silage  at Grange  has 
been  barley  (with  added  minerals/vitamins  and if necessary  protein).  If barley  
is to be replaced  in the feeding  programme  it is important  particularly  with 
finishing  animals  that the alternative  is also of high quality.  In three  studies  a 
high quality  concentrate  based  on barley  was compared  with a low quality  
concentrate  based  on grain screenings.  The concentrates  were fed at 6 kg per 
animal  daily (following  gradual  introduction)  in two feeds with grass silage  
offered  to appetite.  To compensate  for the lower  quality  of the concentrate,  
animals  offered  the grain  screening  consumed  more  silage  (Table  5). However,  
daily  liveweight  gains  were  0.2 kg greater  for those  offered  barley  and carcass  
gains  were  0.17  higher.  Thus,  over  a 150  day feeding  period,  carcass  weight  gain 
would  be 25.5  kg higher  for animals  offered  the concentrate  based  on barley  as 
opposed  to grain  screenings.  These  results  clearly  demonstrate  the importance  
of the quality  of the concentrate  fed as a supplement  to grass  silage.
Feeding  molasses  with silage
In two cases weaned  continental  cross suckler  bulls were fed high quality  
grass  silage  to appetite  and one of the following  supplements  per animal  daily;
A. Barley  4.0 kg
B. Barley  3.6 kg + soyabean  0.4 kg
C. Barley  2.0 kg + molasses  2.0 kg + soyabean  meal  0.3 kg
D. Barley  1.6 kg + molasses  2.0 kg + soyabean  meal  0.7 kg

Thus,  Supplements  A and B had  2 kg of barley  replaced  by 2.0 kg of molasses

supplement  on silage intake (Table  6). Inclusion  of soyabean  with barley  
(Supplement  B) did not improve  weight  gains  over those  offered  barley  alone  
(Supplement  A). However,  animals  offered  molasses  and a low level of 
soyabean  meal  (Supplement  C) had  carcass  weight  gains  of approximately  20 kg 
lower  than  those  offered  the entire  supplement  as barley.  Inclusion  of additional  
soyabean  meal  with molasses  (Supplement  D) improved  carcass  weight  gains.  
In earlier  studies  molasses  compared  favourably  with  barley  in silage  based  diets  
at low dietary  inclusion  rates  but not at high  rates  of inclusion.  It would  appear  
from  the present  studies  that  even  at low inclusion  rates  the protein  content  of the 
diet is more  critical  where  molasses  is fed as opposed  to where  barley  is used.

Feeding  roots  with  silage
Fodder  beet roots are high in energy  and have a protein  content  of 7 to 9 
percent.  In feeding  experiments  pulped  fodder  beet  roots  alone  or with  soyabean  
meal were  compared  with barley  as a supplement  to silage  for finishing  cattle.  
A summary  of these  experiments  is presented  in Table  7.
In the various  studies,  barley  was fed at 2.5 or 3 kg per animal  daily. Animals  
fed roots  alone  or roots  plus soyabean  meal were offered  the same  amount  of 
supplement  dry matter  as the barley  group. All animals  were  given  a suitable  
mineral/vitamin  mbcture.  Daily  carcass  gain  of animals  fed silage  only  was 0.35 
kg. Feeding  a barley  supplement  with silage  increased  carcass  gain to 0.51 kg 
per day but feeding  roots  alone  only increased  gain to 0.44 kg daily. However,  
when soyabean  was included  with  roots  carcass  gains  were  almost  similar  (0.5()

kg per day)  to those  obtained  from  barley.  Silage  intakes  from similar  quantities  
of fodder  beet  and barley  dry matter  were  the same.
In conclusion,  the studies  with fodder  beet roots indicate  the very good  
response  that can be obtained  from supplementary  protein  when protein  is 
limiting.  Thus,  when preparing  diets, the addition^  weight  gain required  to 
offset  the cost of providing  additional  protein  should  be examined  when  using  
feeds  marginal  to low in protein  content.  To offset  the low crude  protein  values  
in fodder  beet (or potatoes)  approximately  1 kg of soyabean  meal (or its 
equialent)  should  be provided  for each  8 kg of roots  dry matter.  Sugar  beet  roots  
contain  only  4 to 5 percent  crude  protein  and where  fed, about  1 kg of soyabean  
meal should  be given  for each  4 kg of roots  dry matter.  This additional  protein  
will provide  a crude  protein  content  of the mixture  similar  to that of barley.
Feed Additives
Feed  additives  that are available  commercially  include  Romensin  (Monen-  
sin), Avotan  (Avoparcin)  and Havomycin.  Most  studies  with feed  additives  at 
Grange  using  finishing  animals  in winter  have  been  conducted  with  Romensin.  
In a summary  of four experiments  with animals  fed silage  and concentrates  in 
winter,  Romensin  increased  liveweight  and  carcass  gains  by 103 and 51 g per  day 
respectively  (Table  8). In these studies  the effects  of Romensin  on voluntary  
silage  intake  were  minimal.  While  the data are limited  for other  feed  additives  
with  finishing  cattle,  studies  with  weanlings  were  similar  to those  using  Romen ­
sin (increased  liveweight  gain  of 65 g per day).

Supplementary  minerals  and vitamins
Although  grass  silage  is usually  balanced  for minerals,  feeds  such  as barley  
and other  cereals  are low in calcium  whereas  pulp,  roots  and molasses  are low 
in phosphorus.  Potatoes  are also rather  low in phosphorus  and are very low in 
calcium.  Thus, in silage/concentrate  diets,  50 to 100 g per animal  daily of a 
suitable  mineral  and vitamin  mixture  should  be provided  (i.e. about  20 g per kg 
of concentrates).  Where  home grown feeds are used and the silage and 
concentrates  are fed separately  then the mineral/vitamin  (and  protein  if needed)  
supplement  can be satisfactorily  fed by spreading  it evenly  over  the concentrates  
at feeding  time.
Parasite  control
With  heavy  animals,  anthelmintics  for the control  of liver  fluke  are generally  
necessary.  While  treatment  for the control  of hoose  and worms  (effective  against  
Ostertagia  stage  II) is always  necessary  with  weanlings,  there  are circumstances

where  control  measures  would  also be required  with older  animals.  Animals  
must  also be treated  for the control  of lice.
Nutritive  value  of feeds
The metabolisable  energy  (ME)  system  is the system  used  in Ireland  and the 
U.K.  to describe  the energy  value  of feeds. While  this system  effectively  ranks  
the various  feeds in order of nutritional  value it does not directly  allow  
calculation  of relative  monetary  values. The reason  is that the ME of higher  
energy  feeds  such  as barley  is used  more  effectively  than  is that of lower  energy  
feeds. A more  appropriate  energy  system  is that used in the U.S. where,  feeds  
assigned  net energy  for maintenance  and net energy  for gain  values.  Assuming  
that two-thirds  of the feed  energy  is used  for maintenence  and one-third  is used  
for weight  gain, a single energy  value for each feed has been calculated.  
These  values  relative  to the comparable  value  for rolled  barley  are shown  in 
Table  9.
Likewise,  the protein  value  of feeds  is generally  shown  as crude  protein  but 
because  the crude  protein  values  of two feeds  are similar  they  are not necessarily  
equally  effective  sources  of protein.  The digestibility  of protein  in feeds  such  as 
roots  is lower  than  that in barley  and in the extent  to which  protein  escapies  break ­
down  in the rumen  but is digested  further  along  the digestive  tract also varies  
between  feeds. Within  the above  considerations  relatively  accurate  monetary  
values  can be calculated  for feeds  relative  to one another.  This is done  in Table  
9 using  (A) the net energy  value  assuming  two-thirds  for maintenence  and one- 
third  for weight  gain  relative  to barley  except  where  protein  content  is lower  than 
barley  and (B) the net energy  value  and digestible  crude  protein  as the basis  of 
companson.  Barley  and soyabean  meal  are used  as standards  for the purpose  of 
comparison.
Cereal  grains
Barley  is the main cereal  used for cattle  feeding  in Ireland  and is used as a 
smndard  with which  other feeds are compared.  Both maize  and wheat  have  
higher  energy  values  whereas  oats has a lower  value  (1.16  kg of oats = 1 kg of 
barley).  Although  wheat  is higher  in feeding  value  than barley  it is more  likely  
to cause digestive  upsets. Digestive  upsets can be minimised  by gradual  
introduction,  using rolling  or coarse  grinding  and feeding  concentrates  twice  
rather  than once daily.
Molassed  beet pulp and citrus  pulp
These  contain  90% to 95% the feeding  value of barley. Compared  with 
barley,  they tend to be lower  in phosphorus  (which  is high  in barley)  and thus a 
high phosphorus  mineral/vitamin  supplement  should  be used. This is also 
necessary  where  roots  or molasses  is fed. It is noteworthy  that citrus  pulp is a 
variable  product  and ME values  lower  than that  presented  can be obtained.  The 
crude  protein  content  is about  6.5%.
Tapioca
Although  similar  to barley in energy,  it is very low in protein  (2 7% 
protein).

Molasses
Molasses  is low in crude  protein  (and  phosphorus)  and the availability  of the 
protein  IS also low. The energy  value  is about  two-thirds  that of barley.  The  dry 
matter  content  is about  74%. Asa  general  rule the level  of molasses  should  not 
exceed  15% of total dietary  intake.
High  protein/high  energy  feeds
The  standard  protein  feed  is soyabean  meal  which  has an energy  value  similar  
to barley  and  contains  45-50%  crude  protein.  However,  feeds  such  as com  gluten  
feed,  peas,  cotton  seed and com distillers  grains  are often  available  at competi ­
tive prices  and could  be included  in catUe  rations. Com distillers  grains  are 
similar  to barley  in energy  terms  and have  a cmde  protein  content  of 25%. The 
energy  v^ue  of com  gluten  feed  is somewhat  lower  than barley  but like most  by­
products  it is quite  variable.  In feeding  studies  at Grange,  while  weight  gains  of 
animals  fed com  gluten  were  similar  to those  offered  barley/soyabean  meal,  feed 
intakes  were higher  for those  fed com gluten. Overall  the results  showed  that 
com  gluten  had  only  about  90%  the feeding  value  of  barley/soyabean  meal  which  
gives  it a somewhat  lower  value  than that shown  in Table  9.
High protein/low  energy  feeds
Feeds  such  as rape  seed  meal,  malt  culms,  sunflower  meal  and  brewers  grains  
f^l into this category.  They  are lower  in energy  than  barley  but are good  sources  
of protein.  Wet  brewers  grains  can be satisfactorily  ensiled  and there  is no need  
for preservative.  Malt culms  are variable  and can be lower in quality  than 
indicated.  They  are unpalatable  because  of their bitter  taste and much  of the 
cmde  protein  is present  in the form of non-protein  nitrogen.
Whey
Delactosed  whey  contains  about  30%  dry matter.  It is high  in ash (20%  of the 
dry matter)  and  cmde  protein  (25/%  of the dry matter).  In feeding  trials  involving  
comparisons  of whey  with  barley/soyabean  meal  on a similar  dry matter  basis  as 
supplements  to silage  and  straw,  animal  weight  gains  were  the same.  Thus,  whey  
concentrate  can contain  up to 60% dry matter  and is comparable  to barley  on a 
dry matter  basis. However,  the composition  and particularly  the dry matter  
content  of whey can vary considerably  and therefore  the actual value of a 
particular  batch  will depend  largely  on its dry matter  content
Pressed  beet pulp
Pressed  beet pulp (dry matter  content  20%) can be successfully  ensiled  
without  a preservative.  The ensiled  pressed  pulp is a high quality  feed but the 
protein  quality  is lower  than barley.  This should  be kept  in mind  particularly  at 
high dietary  inclusion  rates or when  fed to young  animals.
Roots  and potatoes
Due to variable  levels  of soil contamination  and likely  greater  storage  losses  
It IS very  difficult  to place  monetary  values  on roots  and potatoes  relative  to that 
of barley. In addition,  handling  of roots and potatoes  is more difficult  and
76
equipment  for chopping  the roots is not available  on most farms. It is also 
noteworthy  that  roots  such  as fodder  beet  can vary,  from  about  12%  to 18% in dry 
matter  content  depending  on variety  and this has a major  influence  on value  per 
tonne  of roots. D^pite  the above  limitations  it can be taken  that  in energy  terms  
1 kg of dry matter  from roots  or potatoes  is equivalent  to 1 kg of rolled  barley.  
However,  to allow  for tare,  roots  and  potatoes  should  be discounted  a further  20% 
approximately.  Sugar  beet roots  have  a dry matter  content  of about  22% and a 
crude content  of fodder  beet  roots  used in Grange  feeding  trials  was 8.6%. To 
allow  for the lower  crude  protein  values  approximately  1 kg of soyabean  meal,  
or the equivalent  from  other  protein  sources  should  be provided  for each 8 and 
4 kg of fodder  beet  (or potatoes)  and sugar  beet  dry matter  fed,  respectively.  This 
additional  protein  will provide  a crude  protein  content  of the mix similar  to that 
of barley.
Roughages
Grass  conserved  as silage  or hay forms  a large proportion  of winter  feed 
requirements.  The nutritive  value of conserved  grass is very variable.  In 
common  with roots  the value  per tonne  of silage  is influenced  dramatically  by 
dry matter  content  but for convenience  a value  of 20%  is assumed.  Because  high 
levels of production  are required  with finishing  animals  only high quality  
conserved  grass  should  be considered  in those  diets  where  roughage  forms  a high 
proportion  of the total diet.

Productivity  of  Different  Steer  Breed  Types  
for Beef  Production
M. G. KEANE
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Over 70% of all cows are dairy cows, predominantly  Friesians.  The 
remainder  are suckler  cows,  predominantly  beef  breed  x Friesians.  Thus,  the vast 
majority  of cattle  for beef  production  are the progeny  of either  Friesian  or beef 
breed  x Friesian  cows. In 1988  and 1989,  approximately  40%  of inseminations  
were  to Friesian,  30%  were  to traditional  beef  breed,  and 30%  were  to continental  
beef breed bulls. To provide  adequate  dairy herd replacements,  Friesian  
inseminations  should  be around  45%, so for the foreseeable  future,  the most  
numerous  single  breed  type of beef  catde  will be Friesian.
Because  of the number  of different  breed  types  available,  it is essential  that 
producers  understand  clearly  the differences  betweeen  them and how the 
desirable  characteristics  of each  can best  be exploited.  To provide  the necessary  
background  information  for this,  a number  of large  scale  experiments  have  been  
earned  out at Grange  in recent  years. The overall  approach  has been  to use the 
Friesian  as a continuous  standard  and to compare  two other  breeds  with the 
Friesian  in individual  experiments.  Then,  at the end of a series  of experiments  
the data for all the breed  types  are ranked  relative  to the Friesian
Comparison  of Friesians,  Hereford  x Friesians  and 
Charolais  x Friesians
The first comparison  involved  Friesian,  (British)  Hereford  x Friesian  and 
Charolais  x Friesian  steers. These  breed  types  represent  about  two thirds  of all 
male beef cattle originating  in the dairy herd. The main results  from this 
comparison  are shown  in Tables  1,2 and 3. Corrected  to the same  slaughter  date 
(750  days  of age),  Friesians  and Hereford  crosses  had similar  slaughter  weights  
but Charolais  crosses  were  38 kg heavier  than  Friesians  (Table  1). Hereford  and 
Charolais  crosses  killed-out  1 % and  2% units,  respectively,  higher  than  Friesians  
with  the result  that respective  carcass  weights  were  10 kg and 32 kg heavier  than

Friesians.  Herefords  had better  conformation  but had a higher  fat score  than 
Friesians.  Charolais  crosses  had better  conformation  and a lower  fat score  than 
either  of the other  two breed  types.
Herefords  had least  bone  and  Friesians  and  Charolais  crosses  had  similar  bone  
proportions  (Table  2). Herefords  had also least muscle  and most  fat while  the 
Charolais  crosses  had most muscle  and least fat. Herefords  had a higher  
proportion  of their  fat subcutaneously  than the other  two  breed  types  which  were  
similar.  This difference  between  breeds  in fat distribution  has implications  for 
the visual  grading  of carcasses  for famess.  Feed intake,  measured  during  the 
finishing  period  showed  (Table  3) that Charolais  consumed  more  feed per day 
than the other  two breed  types. However,  they  were also heavier.  Hence  when  
feed intake  was scaled  for body  weight  no difference  existed  between  the breed  
types. Friesians  and Herefords  had a similar  muscle  size (as indicated  by 
longissimus  dorsi area) and had similar  proportions  of higher  value muscle.  
Thus,  the superior  conformation  of the Herefords  was not reflected  in increased  
muscle  proportion,  muscle  size  or proportion  of higher  value  muscle.  Charolais  
crosses  had a considerably  larger  muscle  size and an increased  proportion  of 
higher value  muscle.

Comparison  of Friesians,  Canadian  Hereford x Friesians and

The third  comparison  involved  Friesian,  Canadian  Hereford  x Friesian  and 
bimmental  x Friesian  steers. The main results  are in Tables  7, 8 and 9. The

Canadian  Hereford  was imported  to improve  the beef  merit  of Hereford  cross  
catde  generally  and it has been claimed  that data obtained  with the traditional  
British  Hereford  are not applicable  to the progeny  of Canadian  Hereford  sires.  
Canadian  Herefords  and Simmentals  were  26 and 33 kg, respectively,  heavier  
than Friesians  at slaughter  (Table  7). They also had 1% and 2% units,  
respectively  higher  killing-out  proportions  than Friesians  and as a result  car­
casses  were 21 and 27 kg heavier  for Canadian  Herefords  and Simmentals  
respectively.  Both beef crosses  had better  conformation  than Friesians  and 
Canadian  Herefords  had a higher  fat score  than the other  two breed  types  which  
were similar.
Canadian  Herefords  had least  bone but they also had least  muscle  and most  
fat (Table  8). Friesians  had most  bone  while  Simmentals  had most  muscle  and 
least  fat As described  previously  for British  Herefords  Canadian  Herefcffds  had

a higher  proportion  of their  fat in the subcutaneous  depot  than  the other  two  breed  
types.  Simmentals  tended  to have  a higher  silage  intake  than  the other  two  breeds  
but there  was no difference  when  silage  intake  was expressed  as a function  of 
liveweight  (Table  9). Friesians  and  Canadian  Herefords  had similar  muscle  sizes  
and similar  proportions  of their  muscle  in the higher  value  cuts.  Simmentals  had 
a larger  muscle  size and more  of their muscle  in the higher  value  cuts.
Relative  performance  of breed  types
The performance  of all the breed  types  evaluated  to date  relative  to Friesians  
is summarised  in Tables  10 and 11. The value  for the Friesians  for each trait is 
set equal  to 100 and the correspondng  values  for the other  breeds  are expressed  
relative  to 100. Except  for the Simmental  and Charolais  crosses  which  were  
heavier,  the other  breed  types  did not  differ  greatly  in slaughter  weight  corrected  
to a constant  age (Table  10). All the beef  crosses  had a higher  kill-out  ratio  than 
Friesians  and the continental  beef crosses  were higher  than the Herefords.  
Because  of the differences  in kill-out,  the ranking  of the breed  types  for carcass  
weight  for age was different  than  for slaughter  weight  for age. Compared  with  
the Friesians,  the beef  crosses  produced  3% to 11 % more  carcass  weight  for age. 
All beef crosses  had considerably  better  conformation  than Friesians  with no 
major  differences  between  the beef  crosses  themselves.  Friesians,  Limousins  
and Simmentals  had similar  fat scores,  Herefords  had higher  fat scores  than all 
others  and Charolais  and Blonde  crosses  had lower  fat scores  than all others.
Friesians  and Herefords  had similar  muscle  weights  for age, similar  muscle  
sizes  and similar  proportions  of higher  value  muscle  (Table  11). All continental  
crosses  had considerably  higher  weights  for age and muscle  sizes  than  Friesians  
and Herefords.  Higher  value muscle  proportion,  although  higher for the 
continentals,  did not differ  much  between  breed  types. Other  than Herefords

which  had higher  values,  the proportion  of fat in the subcutaneous  depot  was 
similar  for the other  breed  types.
The data in Tables  10 and 11 permit  a comparison  of the two strains  of 
Hereford.  Other  than  a difference  in growth  rate which  resulted  in the Canadian  
strain having  a 3% higher  slaughter  weight  for age and a 4% higher  carcass  
weight  for age, the two strains  were  similar.
Comparison  of breed  types  at similar  fatness
Because  of the differences  beween  the breed  types  in carcass  composition,  
animals  from different  breed  types  if slaughtered  at the same  age would  have  
very  different  proportions  of fat and muscle.  Because  of this,  animals  of  different  
breed  types  are usually  not slaughtered  at the same  age  or weight  - some  account  
is taken of fatness  or finish.  The slaughter  and carcass  weights  at which  the 
different  breed  types  would  have the same  proportion  of carcass  fat are shown  
in Table 12. Assuming  that the optimum  slaughter  and carcass  weights  for 
Friesian  steers  is 600 kg and 320  kg respectively,  Herefords  (both  strains)  would  
have a similar  carcass  fat proportion  at correspondng  slaughter  and carcass  
weights  of 530 kg and 280 kg. Limousins  can be taken  to 50 kg liveweight  and 
40 kg carcass  weight  heavier  than Friesians  while  the other  continentals  can be 
taken  to 80-120  kg liveweight  and 60-90  kg carcass  weight  heavier  than  Friesians  
at a similar  level  of carcass  fatness.  As kill-out  proportion  varies  with  weight  for 
all breed  types  the kill-out  values  shown  in Table  12 differ  from those  shown  
earlier  where  slaughter  weights  differ.

Comparison  of international  results
A number  of breed  comparisons  have been carried  out in other  countries  in 
recent  years  but it is often  difficult  to compare  the results  of experiments  from  
different  countries  because  the breeds  used  are not always  the same,  production  
systems  vary and the methodology  particularly  for carcass  assessments  differs  
between  countries  and laboratories.  Therefore,  comparisons  of international  
results  must  be treated  with caution.
Dairy  herd progeny
In Great  Britain  the Meat  and Livestock  Commission  (MLC)  have  conducted  
a number  of evaluations  of the progeny  of dairy  cows  and various  sire breeds  in 
recent  years  (Southgate,  Cook  and Kempster,  1982a,  1988;  Kempster,  Cook  and 
Southgate, 1982a, 1988).  TheMLCvaluesforcarcassweightforageandmuscle

14. Blonde  d'Aquitaine  crosses  were  not included  in the MLC  experiments  and 
Limousin  crosses  were  not included  in two of their  comparisons.  Even  with  the 
four  MLC  Comparisons,  there  was  considerable  variation  in the magnitude  of the 
differences  between  breed  types  in carcass  weight  for age (Table  13). Relative  
to Friesians  at 100,  Limousins  were  104 and 112 in the two  comparisons  in which  
they were  included,  Simmentals  ranged  from 106 to 112 and Charolais  ranged  
from 115 to 119. This  indicates  that the differences  between  breed  types  shown  
in any one experiment  should  be regarded  as approximations  and not absolutes.  
The Grange  and MLC  results  are similar  for Friesians,  Herefords  and Simmen ­
tals, but the superiority  of the Charolais  crosses  was greater  in all four MLC  
comparisons  than in the Grange  comparison.  In the case  of the Limousins,  one 
of the MLC  results  was similar  to the Grange  result  while  the other  MLC result  
was  better.  Notwithstanding  these  differences  however,  the overall  pattern  of the 
results  was similar.  In all five comparisons,  the Charolais  crosses  were  superior  
to all others. In four of five comparisons  the Simmentals  were supierior  to all 
others  except  the Charolais  crosses.  In two of three  comparisons  the Limousins  
were  inferior  to the Simmentals  and  in all three  they  were  superior  to the Friesians  
and Herefords  which for all practical  purposes  were similar. Thus in five 
separate  comparisons  there  is dmost  complete  agreement  in the ranking  of the 
breeds  for carcass  weight  for age.
Table  14 shows  relative  muscle  weights  for age for the Grange  and four  MLC  
comparisons.  As with carcass  weight  for age, there  are the differences  between

the breed  types. However,  the ranking  of the breeds  was virtually  consistent  
across  the five comparisons.  As with carcass  weight  for age, there are some  
differences between  the MLC  experiments  in the magnitude  of the differences  
between  the breed types. However,  the ranking  of the breeds  was virtually  
consistent  across  the five comparisons.  In all five comparisons,  the charolais  
crosses  ranked  highest  and in four  of the five  the Simmentals  ranked  next. In one 
comparison,  the Limousin  surpassed  the Simmentals.  There  was  abig  difference  
between  all of the continent^  crosses  on the one hand and the Friesians  and 
Herefords,  which  were  similar,  on the other.
Suckler  herd progeny
Because  the Grange  comparisons  were carried  out using Friesians  and 
Friesian  crossses,  it would  be useful  to know  if the differences  between  sire 
breeds  found  with  Friesian  dairy  cows  would  apply  also  with  beef  suckler  cows.  
Because  the Hereford  is the predominant  sire breed  used in suckler  herds,  the 
Hereford  was  taken  as the standard  for this  evaluation  and  the Hereford  data  from  
Grange  were  set equal  to 100. In addition,  the data  from  three  other  comparisons  
(Germ Plasma  Evaluation  Program,  1974; Southgate,  Cook and Kempster,  
1982b;  Kempster,  Cook  and Southgate,  1982b)  of the progeny  from suckler  
cows were summarised.  In carcass  weight  for age the Charolais  crosses  were  
superior  to all other breed types (Table  15). Simmentals  were superior  to 
Herefords  in all five comparisons  and in four comparisons  with  Limousins  the 
Simmentals  were  superior  each  time. In the two  comparisons  involving  Blondes,  
they were superior  to Limousins  in both, and to Simmentals  in one of the 
comparisons.  Limousins  were  superior  to Herefords  in three  of four compari ­
sons and equal to them in the remaining  comparison.  In all comparisons,  
Blondes,  Simmentals  and Charolais  crosses  were  superior  to Limousins.
In muscle  weight  for age (Table  16), the pattern  was  similar  to that  for carcass  
weight  for age except  that the difference  between  Herefords  and Limousins  was 
much  greater.  In all five  comparisons,  the Charolais  crosses  were  superior  to all 
others. In the two comparisons  in which  they were  included,  the Blondes  were  
superior  to the Simmentals,  the Simmentals  were  superior  to the Limousins  and 
as indicated  the Limousins  were  much  superior  to the Herefords.

It is clear  therefore  that in different  countries  involving  different  production  
systems,  foundation  stock  and slaughter  weights,  there  is remarkable  agreement  
on the ranking  of the different  breed  types. In all nine separate  comparisons  of 
carcass  weight  for age involving  Herefords,  Simmentals  and Charolais  were  at 
^e top and the Herefords  were at the bottom  in all nine. In six comparisons  
involving  Limousins,  they were  superior  to Herefords  in all six, they  were  never  
superior  to Charolais  and were superior  to Simmentals  only once. In two 
comparisons  involving  Blondes,  they were superior  to Limousins  in both and 
superior  to Simmentals  in one. For all practical  purposes,  Friesians  and 
Herefords  can be considered  similar. In terms  of muscle  weight  for age (not 
shown)  the trends were similar  to carcass  weight  for age except  that the 
differences  were  greater.  All of the continental  crosses  were  at least  8% superior  
to the Friesians  and Herefords  which  were similar. Charolais  crosses  were  
superior  to all others  except  the Blondes  in one comparison.  The Blondes  were  
superior  to the Simmentals  in the two comparisons  in which  they  were included  
and the Simmentals  were  superior  to the Limousins  in five of the six compari ­
sons.
Conclusions
1. Approximately  40% of dairy-bred  male cattle for beef production  are 
Friesians,  30%  are Angus  and Hereford  x Friesians  and 30%  are continental  
X Friesians.
Breeds  differ  in many  characteristics  but feed intake  per unit liveweight  is 
fairly  similar  for all breed  types.
Carcasses  of Friesian  steers slaughtered  at around  two years of age 
following  moderately  intensive  rearing  weigh  about 320 kg. If reared  
similarly  and slaughtered  at the same  time,  carcasses  of Hereford,  Canadian
Hereford,  Limousin,  Blonde  d'Aquitaine,  Simmental  and  Charolais  crosses  
would  weigh  330, 342,330 346, 349 and 355 kg resfiectively.
Carcass  weights  at similar  levels  of carcass  famess  for Friesian,  Hereford,  
Canadian  Hereford,  Limousin,  Blonde  d'Aquitaine,  Simmental  and Charo ­
lais crosses  are 320, 280,280  ,360,410,  380 and 400 kg respectively.
All beef crosses  have higher  kill-out  rates than Friesians  and continental  
crosses  have higher  rates than Hereford.

6. All  beef  crosses  have  better  conformation  than  Friesians  but within  the beef

7. Continental  crosses  have  larger  muscle  sizes  and higher  proportions  of their  
muscle  in the higher  value  cuts  than  Friesians  and Herefords,  between  which  
there is little difference  in these  respects.
8. Herefords  have  a higher  proportion  of their  carcass  fat in the subcutaneous  
depot  than  other  breed  types  which  are similar.
9. Kill-out  rate increased  by about  1 % unit for each  40 kg (Herefords),  50 kg 
(Friesians)  and 60-70  kg (continentals)  increase  in slaughter  weight.
10. Relative  (Friesian=100)  muscle  weights  for age for various  breed  crosses  
are: Hereford  99, Canadian  Hereford  102, Limousin  109, Simmental  113, 
Blonde  115 and Charolais  117.
11. There  is consistent  agreement  across  a number  of comparisons  carried  out 
in different  countries  that the Charolais  is superior  to all other  breed  typres,  
it is followed  by the Simmental  or the Blonde  and then  by the Limousin.  All 
continentals  are superior  to Herefords  and Friesians  which  are broadly  
similar  in productivity.

Suckler  Cows

Introduction
The biological  efficiency  of suckler  beef  production  is limited  by the cow's  
reproductive  rate,  a maximum  of one  calf  per  cow  per year,  and  by the rate  of  gain 
of the calf. These  limitations  are often  compounded  by late calving,  extremely  
long  calving  intervals,  and high  culling  rates  because  of barrenness.  Because  the 
suckler  cow enterprise  is largely  a breeding  enterprise,  financial  returns  depend  
on getting  the cow to calve at the optimum  time each year. Reproductive  
performance  is, therefore,  very important  Because  of the suckling  effect  of the 
calf,  the cow  is endocrinologically  and physiologically  differentto  the dairy  cow 
in terms  of onset  of  cyclicity  and  oestrous  behaviour.  Also,  in attempts  to further  
increase  the econimic  efficiency  of the enterprise  they are managed  and fed 
differently . For  example,  they  are allowed  to accumulate  body  reserves  over  the 
grazing  season,  these  reserves  are then  mobilized  during  the winter  to supply  part 
of their  energy  requirements.  It is important  to understand  the implications  of 
these differences  for reproductive  performance  and how their effects  can be 
minimized.
The objectives  of a good breeding programme  should  include
1. 365 day calving  interval.
2. Early  compact  calving  with 90% of cows calving  in 8 weeks.
3. A replacement  rale of less than 20%.
Resumption  of post-partum  cyclicity
One  of the major  limitations  to improvement  of reproductive  efficiency  is the 
extended  ix>st-partum  period  which  is longer  in suckler  than in dairy cows.  
Recent  research  has elucidated  some  of the endocrine  events  involved  in the 
resumption  of cyclicity  post-partum  and these  are briefly  summarised.
Endocrine  events  leading  to first ovulation
During  pregnancy  the high circulating  concentrations  of progesterone  and 
oestradiol  result in prolonged  negative  feedback  on the hypKDthalamic-hypo-  
physial  axis resulting  in an inhibition  of the synthesis  of luteinizing  hormone  
(LH) by the anterior  pituitary  gland. This in turn results  in the depletion  of 
pituitary  stores  of LH and in a reduction  in basal  release  rates. After  calving  a 
two-phase  recovery  of the hypothalamic-hypophysial-gonadal  axis  occurs.  The 
first phase  lasting,  two to five weeks,  is characterised  by relatively  infrequent  
discharges  of gonadotrophin  releasing  hormone  (GnRH)  into the hypothalamic-  
hypophysial  portal  circulation,  about  one pulse  every  4-8 hours. This mode  of 
GnRH  secretion  effectively  stimulates  the biosynthetic  machinery  in the gona ­
dotrophs  and the rate of synthesis  of LH increases.  The pulses  of GnRH  are
88
sufficiently  spaced  that most  of the newly  synthesised  LH is conserved  rather  
than secreted  into peripheral  circulation.  During  this early  post-partum  period  
the pulses  of LH are of insufficient  magnitude  to induce  follicular  maturation.  
When  pituitary  stores  of LH have  returned  to normal,  pulses  of LH of sufficient  
amplitude  and frequency  are released  into the circulation  to stimulate  follicular  
growth.  This marks  the beginning  of the second  phase  of the recovery  process.  
During  the second  phase,  the increased  circulating  concentrations  of LH stimu ­
late growth  of ovarian  follicles  and the resultant  secretion  of oestradiol.  The 
increased oestradiol  secretion  increases  the sensitivity  of the hypothalamic  and 
hypophysal tissues  to the positive  feedback  effects  of oestradiol.  At this point,  
the frequency  of  discharges  of  GnRH  increases,  in turn,  producing  more  frequent  
pulses  of LH. These  events  lead  to the final  stages  of follicular  development  and 
culminate  in ovulation.
The first  phase  of this recovery  process  (events  leading  to increased  pituitary  
stores  of LH) are believed  to be relatively  independent  of the suckling  stimulus  
and of genetic  and environmental  factors. However,  the second  phase  of the 
recovery  (events  leading  to increased  frequency  of discharges  of LH) appear  to 
be tightly  coupled  to the suckling  stimulus  as well as to a variety  of genetic  and 
environmental  factors.  Some  of the more  important  factors  are discussed  here.
Suckling  effects
It is now well established  that it is the suckling  stimulus  rather  than lactation  
itself that increases  the interval  to the first oestrus. Suckling  will suppress  
pulsatile  secretion  of LH fora  longer  period  after  parturition  than  milking  peters  
et al, 1981),  even when  milking  is increased  to four times  per day (Carruthers  
& Hafs, 1980). Evidence  is emerging  that the suckling  induced  inhibition  of 
reproductive  function  is exerted  through  the release  of endogenous  opoid  
peptides  which  suppress  the secretion  of GnRH  in turn suppressing  the secretion  
of LH. The inhibitory  effect(s)  of the endogenous  opioid  peptides  seem  to be 
short-lived  since  cows  must  suckle  more  than four  times  per day before  the post 
partum  interval  is extended.  Therefore,  the inhibition  of LH secretion  is 
observed  in cows  whose  calves  are allowed  to suckle  ad libitum  but not in cows  
that are milked  twice  daily. Inhibition  of this phase  of recovery  process  persists  
until the suckling  stimulus  and/or  environmental  stressors  are reduced  to the 
point where  more frequent  discharges  of GnRH  begin to occur. The above  
information  can be combined  within  a management  strategy  to overcome  some  
of the consequences  of the suckling  effect.
There  is emerging  evidence  that the physical  presence  of the calf  has effects  
on both the interval  from calving  to first ovulation  and also on the intensity  of 
oestrus  in suckler  cows.
Nutrition  and reproductive efficiency  in suckler cows
Cow  nutrition  is the most  important  factor  influencing  suckler  beef  produc ­
tion. Feed costs alone  account  for approximately  75% of the variable  costs  
involved.  There  is extensive  evidence  which  links  nutrition  to the duration  of the 
post-partum  interval  and to variations  in subsequent  calving  rate. However  the 
relationship  is complex  and involves  interactions  between  nutrient  intake,
89
weighuhange,  body  condition,  cow live  weight  and age, milk  yield  and suckling  
intensity.  A further  difficulty  with suckler  cows is that they differ  in their  
response  to a given  level of nutrition  due to differences  in age, size, milk  yield,  
stage of gestation,  environment  and body condition.  To overcome  these  
difficulties  in describing  the nutrient  requirements  of suckler  cows a body  
condition  scoring  system  has been  developed.  Condition  scoring  on a scale  of 1 
(very  thin and emaciated)  to 5 (grossly  overfat)  is a semi-objective  measurement  
of the fat reserves  of the cow. It has been shown  to be a good  indicator  of the 
cow ’s nutritionl  status  and equally  important,  a good  predictor  of her likely  future  
performance.  This has led to the concept  target  body condition  score  at critical  
stages  of production.  Other  aspects  of using  target  condition  scores  are that they 
allow  for the accumulation  of body  reserves  in summer  when  feed  costs  are low, 
and the controlled  mobilisation  of body  reserves  during  winter  when  feed  costs  
are high.
Pre-partum  nutrition
Frequendy  many producers  are more concerned  with the effects  of pre­
calving  nutrition  on calf weight  and ease of calving  rather than on other  
reproductive  parameters.  While  the conceptus  imposes  huge nutritional  de­
mands  on the cow particularly  during  the last trimester  of gestation,  it appears  
that maternal  system  will sacrifice  body  reserves  to meet  this demand.  There ­
fore, birth weight  of the calf  will be only slightly  reduced  under  severe  nutrient  
restriction.  In late pregnancy  the cow will,  in essence,  lose weight  proportional  
to the weight  gain of the calf. However,  severe  under  nutrition  during  late 
gestation  has implications  for calf vigour,  survival  and growth  performance.  
However,  energy  restriction  in late pregnancy  results  in cows  calving  in a thin 
body condition.  A significant  relationship  has been shown  between  body  
condition  at calving  and subsequent  pregnancy  rate  (Table  1). Only  72%  of cows  
that were  thin at calving  were  pre^ant  after  an 80 day breeding  period  compared  
with 89% and 90% for cows in moderate  and good condition  at calving,  
respectively . TTiere  was,  also  a decrease  in the proportion  of cows  pregnant  early  
in the breeding  period  when  they were  thin at calving.  The main  reason  for the 
lowered pregnancy  rate in thin  cows  is the extended  interval  to first  post-partum  
oesu-us.
High levels  of feeding  in late gestation  does result  in over fat cows. Over  
fatness  directly  increases  the incidence  of calving  difficulty  (see Table  2). The

consequences  of excessive  feeding  are more pronounced  in heifers  than in 
mature cows.
For cows  in good  body condition  it is recommended  that they maintain  their  
body weight  up until caving. This means  that they are losing  some body  
condition  when  the growth  of the conceptus  is taken  into consideration.
Post-partum  nutrition
While  it is important  that cows  calve  down  in good  body  condition  the level  
of nutrition  during  lactation  does have an effect  on reproductive  performance.  
After  calving  there  is a dramatic  increase  in the nutrient  requirement  of the cow 
as well as a change  in the ranking  in which  nutrients  are utilized.  After  calving  
the priority  for nutrients  are for maintenance,  milk production  and lastly for 
reproduction.  Reproduction  will be the first function  to suffer with poor  
nutrition.  Almost  inevitably  there  is some  loss in body  condition  after  calving.  
However,  this loss should  be minimised.  Cows  calving  in a moderate  to good  
body condition  and receiving  an adequate  plane  of nutrition  post calving  will 
generally  resume  cyclicity  and can be successfully  mated  to calve  down  with 12 
months.  However,  if weight  loss after  calving  is severe,  even  cows  calving  in 
good body  condition  may not cycle  or may initiate  cyclicity  and then become  
anoestrous.  These  effects  are compounded  if cows  receive  low levels  of nutrition  
both before  and after  calving.
Nutritional  management  of suckler  cows and the use of body condition  
scores
Target  condition  score  at calving,  mating  and at weaning  are presented  in 
Table  3. For spring  calving  suckler  cows  the critical  target is condition  score  at

91
mating  which  is set at 2. This  relatively  low score  at mating  is compensated  for 
by the high  nutritive  value  of spring  grass  which  allows  the cows  to be in positive  
energy  balance  throughout  the mating  period. On the other hand the target  
condition  score  at mating  for autumn  calving  cows  is 2.5 as cows  are expected  
to rebreed  while  mobilising  some  body  reserves.
Breeding  management  of heifers  and first calvers
The  extended  calving  season  common  in many  suckler  herds  is often  the  result  
of  poor  management  of heifers  and first  calvers.  Date  of first  calving  determines  
calving  date in subsequent  years  as well as future  calving  spread  for the herd.  
Once  established,  it is difficult  to alter  calving  pattern.  Ensuring  that heifers  
calve  compactly  2-3 weeks  before  the main  herd  wiU,  over  a 5-6  year  period,  help 
to reduce  the calving  spread  of the herd. Because  first calvers  have a longer  
interval  to resumption  of cyclicity  than older  cows,  calving  them  in advance  of 
the main  herd  ensures  that  a higher  proportion  are cyclic  at the start  of the mating  
period.  Furthermore,  the longer  the calving  to service  interval  the higher  will be 
the conception  rates  following  mating.  The mating  period  for heifers  should  be 
strictly  confined  to 6 weeks.  Late  calving  heifers  will  be late  calving  cows  in later 
years. While  calved  heifers  have lower  maintenance  requirements  and lower  
milk production  than mature  cows, they nevertheless,  have an additional  
nutritional  requirement  for maternal  growth.  This  results  in a greater  overall  feed 
requirement  compared  to mature  cows. If additional  feed  is not  provided  to meet  
this extra  demand,  the calved  heifer  will draw  upon her body  reserves,  in other  
words  essentially  on her body condition.  Nature  dictates  that first nutritional  
priority  be given  to nourishing  the calf. Consequently,  growth  of the young  cow 
may be slowed  or stopped  during  this period. More  seriously,  repr^uction  is 
delayed  if nutrition  is inadequate.  The net result  is an increased  calving  interval  
and higher  culling  rates for barrenness.
To minimise  rebreeding  problems  in first  calvers  it is critical  that  replacement  
heifers  should  calve  2 to 3 weeks  in advance  of the main  herd. Also  they  are well 
grown  at the time  of mating(in  excess  of 330 kg at 15 months)  and  calving  (500-1-  
kg). This  will,  also  ensure,  that  the replacement  heifers  are regularly  cycUc  at 15 
months . Pregnancy  rates  are lower  at the pubertal  and  first  post  pubertal  heat  than 
at subsequent  heats. Heifers  should  always  be mated  to an easy calving  sire.
Effect  of heterosis  on fertility  in suckler  cows
It is well recognised  that crossbreeds  are superior  to purebreds  as suckler  
cows.  This  phenomenon,  known  as hybrid  vigour  or heterosis,  is one  of the main  
reasons  for using  crossbred  suckler  cows. Crossbred  cows survive  and grow  
better,  and  attain  puberty  at an earlier  age, have  shorter  calving  to first  ovulation  
intervals,  have higher  conception  rates and their offspring  survive  and grow  
better. The cumulative  advantage  over  purebreds  is estimated  to be about  23% 
in calf weaning  weight  per cow exposed  to mating.  To maximise  heterosis  the 
crossbred  cow should  in turn be crossed  with a sire of a third  breed,  preferably  
a continental  breed  sire. The  other  reason  for using  crossbred  cows  for suckling  
is breed  complementarity.  This  consists  of the combining  economically  impor ­
tant traits  from  different  breeds  within  the crossbred  cow. For  example,  the milk
92
prcxluction  characteristics  of the Friesian  breed is combined  with the beef 
characteristics  of the Hereford  in the Hereford  X Friesian  suckler  cow. Recent  
studies  at Grange  recorded  small  differences  between  Hereford  X Friesian  and 
Limousin  X Friesian  genotypes  regarding  their suitability  as suckler  cows  but 
with whatever  differences  that  exist  being  in favour  of the Limousin  X Friesian.
Choice  of terminal  sire breed
Because  the calf is the only saleable  output  from the suckler  cow weaning  
weight  is a major  determinant  of profitability.  Sire  breeds  have  a much  greater  
effect  on weaning  weight  than cow breeds. However,  the advantage  of faster  
growth  rates  and heavier  weaning  weights,  must  be offset  by the increased  birth  
weight  which  increases  the incidence  of difficult  calvings  and calf mortality.  
Also,  gestation  length  is about  one week  longer  in cows mated  to continental  
sires. The larger  continental  breeds,  Charolais,  Simmental  and Blonde  d'Aqui ­
taine  should  be used  on the mature  cows. Heifers  should  always  be mated  by an 
easy calving  bull. For heifers  calving  at two years  of age this invariably  means  
either  a Hereford  or Aberdeen  Angus  bull. An easy  calving  Limousin  bull could  
be used on two year old heifers  or in situations  where  calving  management  is 
good. All bulls,  however,  are capable  of giving  rise to some  degree  of calving  
difficulty.
Bull fertility
In suckler  herds  the primary  functions  of a bull are to get cows  pregnant  and 
to produce  live healthy  calves,  which have  high  growth  potential,  with minimal  
calving  difficulty.  In order  to get cows  pregnant  a bull must  have  sufficient  sex 
drive  (libido)  to seek  out cows  in heat,  be capable  of producing  ample  amounts  
of viable semen,  be structurally  sound  and physically  fit to deposit  the semen  to 
enable  conception.
Frequently  the role of the bull in herd reproductive  performance  of the herd 
is taken for  granted.  The fertility  of the bull is several  times  more  important  than 
that of individual  cows. A bull is usually  expected  to successfuly  cover  up to 45 
cows  while  each  cow  is expected  to wean  only  one  calf  each  year. Subfertile  bulls  
cause  extended  calving  seasons,  low calf  crops  and consequently  low weaning  
weights.  Therefore,  on farms  using  natural  service,  bull fertility  has a major  
impact  on profitability.  Unfortunatley,  a bull's  infertility  or subfertility  is not 
usually  discovered  until  at least  one repeat  interval  has elapsed  after  joining  the 
herd. In Ireland  there  is no information  on fertility  of bulls in natural  service.  
However, Scottish  workers  (Lowman  et a, 1980)  reported  that 3-5%  of bulls  in 
natural service  were  completley  infertile,  while  a further  30% were  classified  as 
unsatisfactory  in terms  of semen  quality,  penile  abnormalities,  and libido.
A bull may not remain  fertile  for all of its working  life or indeed  throughout  
a single  mating  season.  For  example,  a bull that  was  ill and that had a raised  body  
temperature  for a number  of days will be infertile  for a period. However  this 
pieriod  of infertility  will not occur  immediatley  following  the illness  but 50 to 60 
days later. Similarly,  injury  to the penis,  sheath  or prepuce  while  not affecting  
mounting  behaviour,  can prevent  mating. Therefore,  producers  should  con­
stantly  monitor  bull performance.
93
In an attempt  to reduce  the extent  of bull infertility  a breeding  soundness  
examination  was developed  in the United  States. This involves  a complete  
physical  examinationTr^tal  examination,  scrotal  circumference  measurement,  
semen  collection  and evaluation.  Scrotal  circumference  measurements  are 
accurate  predictors  of sperm output Bulls with large testes produce  more  
spermatozoa.  Scrotal  circumference  in young  bulls  is, also,  positively  correlated  
with fertility  traits. As scrotal  circumference  increases  sperm motility  and 
percentage  normal  sperm  also increase.  The overall  fertility  classificaiton  of a 
bull is based  on the lowest  classification  obtained  on any  part  of the examination.  
While  this gives  a good  prediction  of a bull's  fertility  there  are other  components  
which  are equally  important.  Bull libido  is vital and has litUe  or no association  
with other fertility  traits, such as semen quality  or scrotal  circumference.  
Difference  in libido  test scores  of individual  bulls have been associated  with 
significant  differences  in actual  pregnancy  rate.
Because  of the variability  in fertility  between  bulls  it is difficult  to give  precise  
guidelines  regarding  the maximum  number  or cows  that should  be allotted  to a 
bull. The usual  recommendations  are 20 to 30 cows  for young  bulls and 40 to 
50 cows  for mature  bulls.
While  complete  breeding  soundness  examinations  of bulls  are not carried  out 
in Ireland,  nevertheless,  a veterinary  examination  of a bull combined  with a 
semen  evaluation  taken  one month  before  the start  of the mating  period  will help 
to identify  the majority  of infertile  bulls.
Use of A.L in suckler  herds
Between  30 and 40% of suckler  cows in Ireland  are bred by artificial  
insemination.  Most  of these  cows  are located  in the smaller  herds  where  close  
supervision  for heat detection  is possible  and where  herd size is too small  to 
justify  the purchase  of a bull for natural  service.
Advantages  of using  A. I.
Artificial  insemination  offers  a wide  range  of genetically  superior  sires  which  
are performance  and/or  progeny  tested  for growth  rate,  conformation,  fatness,  as 
well  as surveyed  for ease  of calving.  The range  of breeds  and sires  within  breeds  
allows  producers  to select  a particular  bull for an individual  cow rather  than 
having  all cows  mated  by one bull in the case  of natural  service.  In small  herds  
the use of artificial  insemination  eliminates  the need  for keeping  a bull while  in 
larger  herds  it reduces  the number  of bulls  required.
Disadvantages of using A.I.
The main disadvantage  of using A.I. is that its success  is almost  totally  
dependentontheefficiencyofheatdetection  achieved.  Research  has shown  that 
heat detection  efficiency  is usually  the weakest  link in reproductive  manage ­
ment. Heat  detection  is time  consuming  and requires  total commitment  for the 
duration  of the breeding  period.
To use A. I. successfully  a number  of critical  management  points  must be 
understood  and followed,  particularly  in relation  to the occurrence,  duration  and 
behaviourial  signs  of heat.
94
Signs  of heat
1. Standing  to be mounted  by herd  mate  or bull: This  is the most  definite  sign.
2. Discharge  of clear mucus: this originates  in the uterus  and is a good  
indication  of imminent  heat.
3. Restlessness  and mounting  behaviour:  Signs of restlessness  are often  
characteristic  of individual  cows  that are either  approaching  or are in heat.
4. Swelling  of vulva: Hormonal  changes  associated  with heat cause an 
increased blood  supply  to the reproductive  organs  which  in turn cause  swelling  
and reddening  of the vulva.
5. Hair  loss and dirt marks:  The hair on the tail head is usually  removed  by 
continuous  mounting  by herd mates  and the skin on either  side of the tail head  
is often  scarred  and dirty.
Duration  and intensity  of heat
It has generally  been accepted  that heat lasts for about  18 hours,  but recent  
studies  at Moorepark  with Spring  grazing  dairy  cows  indicate  that while  some  
cows  have  a standing  heat  period  of up to 30 hours,  the average  duration  is only 
9 hours.  Also,  over  one third  of all heat  periods  were  less than  6 hours  in duration  
and breaks  in standing  behaviour  are common.  It is likely  that  the duration  of heat 
is of similar  length  in suckler  cows. However,  the intensity  of heat  behaviour  is 
less in suckler  cows  due to the suckling  stimulus  and the physical  presence  of the 
calf. This lower  intensity  of behaviour  makes  heat detection  more  difficult.
Heat  detection  accuracy.
Failure  to observe  and record heat  is one of the major  factors  reducing  repro ­
ductive  efficiency  in A. I. programmes.  Studies  from many  countries  indicate  
that farmers  frequently  achieve  a heat  detection  rate of 60 to 70% and that up to 
20%  of cows  submitted  for insemination  are not in fact in heat. Careful  checking  
in the early  morning  and late evening  will detect  at least 70% of cows  in heat;  
three further  checks  during  the day are required  to detect  90% of cows  in heat. 
The best time to observe  cows  is when  they are at rest. Sometimes,  judgement  
has to be made  on a combination  of and behavioural  patterns  rather  than on an 
observed  standing  behaviour  and consequently  it is important  to understand  and 
recognise  the signs  of heat.
Timing  of insemination
In the cow  ovulation  occurs  at about  30 hours  after  onset  of standing  heat  and 
is not influenced  by duration  of heat. Because  the viable  life of the ovum  is less 
than 12 hours,  and that  of the sperm  24 to 36 hours,  correct  timing  of insemination  
is important.  The optimum  time to inseminate  is during  the second  half of the 
heat period  and for a few hours after the end of heat. The best practical  
recommendation  is that cows first observed  in standing  heat in the morning  
should  be inseminated  that evening,  while  cows first observed  standing  in the 
evening  should  be inseminated  the following  morning.  Correct  timing  of 
insemination  is critical  if bulls  of below  average  fertility  are being  used.
95
Fertility  - Artificial  insemination  versus  natural  service
Artificial  insemination  is often  criticised  on the gounds  that  pregnancy  rate  is 
lower  tlmn following  natural  service.  Apparent  improvement  in pregnancy  rate 
often  arises  following  the introduction  of a bull. This  apparent  improvement  is 
likely  to be due to cows  now being  mated  at a longer  post-partum  interval,  and 
or bemuse  inaccuracies  in heat detection  are now eliminated.  Where  heat 
detection  is accurate,  and when  insemination  is timed  and carried  out correctly,  
pregnancy  rate is similar  following  A. I. or natural  service.
The combined  effect of heat detection  and pregnancy  rates on calving  
spread
Accurate  heat detection  and correct  timing  of insemination  will result  in an 
overall  herd  pregnancy  rate of 60% to each insemination.  Under  good  manage ­
ment,  a conception  rate of 70% will be achieved  over  the first  four  weeks  of the 
breeding  season.  During  this first month  of breeding,  most  cows  presented  for 
insemination  are calved  for about  two months  or more  and are inseminated  at 
their ^ond  or third heat. Conception  rate falls during  the second  month  of 
breeding  because  a higher  proportion  of cows  presented  are often  at the first  or 
^ond  heat and have not had sufficient  time for the completion  of uterine  
involution  and the re-establishment  of normal  cyclicity.
If the intensive  heat  checking  required  throughout  the season  to achieve  good  
results  with  A. 1. is difficult  to implement,  a combination  of a shortened  period  
(4 weeks)  of heat  detection,  followed  by the introduciton  of a bull is a successful  
alternative  where  herd  size  allows.  This will combine  the use of A. I. on the early  
calving  and more  fertile  cows  and allow  the later  calving  and repeat  cows  to be 
bred by a bull. This  strategy  will also  help  to ensure  a compact  calving  pattern.  
While  accurate  heat  detection  is central  to a high  level  of reproductive  perform ­
ance,  it is the combination  of heat  detection  and conception  rate that  determines  
the compactness  of otherwise  of the calving  pattern.  (Table  4).

When  heat detection  and conception  rates  are high,  most  cows  calve  within  
a 12-week pieriod. Otherwise,  the breeding  season  and subsequent  calving
96
season must be extended  in order to get an acceptable  proportion  of the 
herd in calf.
Techniques  for improving  heat  detection  efficiency
Many  attempts,  based  on the cow's  overt  oestrous  behaviour  or on phsysiol-  
ogical  changes  associated  with  oestrus,  have  been  made  that would  both  reduce  
the labour  and increase  the efficiency  of heat  detection.  However,  to-date  there  
have  been  few developments  which  are practical  at farm  level  with the possible  
exception  of tail-painting  or the use of vasectomized  teaser  bulls.
Tail-painting
In dairy  cows  tail-painting  has proved  to be a useful  aid to heat detection.  
However,  its usefulness  in suckler  cows  is more  variable,  primarily  due to the 
lower  intensity  of behaviourial  heat  in suckler  cows,  resulting  in less mounting  
activity  and therefore  less complete  removal  of the paint. The paint  is applied  
as a strip of emulsion  paint  5-8 cm wide  and 20-25  cm long from the tail head  
forward.  When  a cow is mounted  a number  of times  this strip  of paint  is either  
partially  or totally  removed  by the mounting  animals.  The  problem  with  suckler  
cows is that the intensity  of mounting  activity  is often low and consequently  
removal  of the strip  of paint  is incomplete.  The paint  needs  to be applied  every  
7 to 10 days to a clipped  and brushed  tail-head  and under  dry conditions.
Teaser  bulls
There  are several  methods  of surgical  altering  bulls to render  them either  
sterile  or unable  to successfully  mate but capable  of mounting.  The most  
common  is vasectomy  whereby  a part of the vas deferens  is removed.  This 
procedure  does not affect  their  libido  or ability  to mate. However,  it should  be 
carried  out 2-3 months  prior to the mating  season  to allow the bull time to 
recover.  The  bull may  then  be fitted  with  a chin-ball  marker  device.  The  marker  
device  involves  a paint reservoir  attached  to a halter  that holds it under  the 
animal's  chin. A b^l on the lower  side  of this reservoir  releases  a marking  paint  
when compressed.  When  the teaser  mounts  a female  in heat his chin will strike  
her back,  releasing  the paint  and marking  the animal.  Cows  are checked  twice  
daily for paint  marks  in conjuction  with other  signs  of heat. The reservoir  is 
refilled  at fortnightly  intervals.  Such  a bull can prove  useful  in detecting  heat 
particularly  in suckler  cows  where  the intensity  of heat is often  low. However,  
like intact  bulls  considerable  variation  in hbido,  also,  exists  among  teaser  bulls.  
Bulls  with  a high  libido  generally  prove  to be the more  efficient  at detecting  cows  
in heat. Teaser  bulls  require  the same  management  as entire  bulls.
Reducing  the suckling  stimulus
While  the nutrient  requirements  to maintain  lactation  are large,  this effect  is 
further compounded  by the suckling  stimulus  which delays  the resumption  of 
postpartum  cyclicity.  Removing  a portion  of the suckling  stimulus,  by allowing  
calves  to suckle  only once or twice  daily,  will advance  the onset  of cyclicity.  
Where  the use of this technique  is planned  commencement  of separation  should
97
begin  at 35 days  post  calving  and should  continue  until the cow is inseminated.  
An added  bonus  of this technique  is that it greatly  facilitates  heat detection  
because  cows  are penned  twice  daily.  Furthermore,  removal  of the calf  increases  
the intensity  of oestrous  behaviour  thus facilitating  easier  identificaiton  of cows  
in heat. Once  or twice  daily  suckling  seems  to have  no adverse  effect  on cow or 
calf  health  or on calf  weaning  weight  This  strategy  has applications  in situations  
where  calves  are multiple  suckled,  in first  calving  cows  which  generally  have  a 
longer  post  partum  interval,  in late calving  cows,  or in cows  where  the suckling  
effect  of the calf is likely  to be compounded  by poor pre and or post-partum  
nutrition.  Complete  calf removal  for a period of 48 hours has also been  
frequently  used  but with more  variable  results.
Oestrous  synchronization
Oesnous  synchronisation  involves  gaining  control,  not simply  over  the time 
of heat onset,  but, more  importantly  over time of ovulation.  In the early  post­
partum  period,  cyclical  activity  is often not yet resumed  and synchronisation  
here effectively  means  inducing  oestrus  and ovulation.  Because  progesterone,  
secreted  by the corpus  luteum,  is the major  hormone  controlling  the length  of the 
oestrous  cycle,  gaining  control  over  the lifespan  of the corpus  luteum  is the basis  
for controlling  or synchronising  the cycle. There  are two methods  of control  
commercially  available.
1. Prostaglandin  treatment
This  is based  on theadministration  of either  natural  or synthetic  prostaglandin,  
which  induces  rapid  regression  of the functional  corpus  luteum.  Because  only 
animals  with a functional  corpus  luteum  (between  days  5 to 15 of the cycle)  will 
respond  a single  adminisbation  will induce  heat in only about  50% of treated  
females.  However,  by administering  prostaglandin  twice,  at a 12 day interval,  
most  of the animals  will  have  a functional  corpus  luteum  at the time  of the second  
injection  and 80 to 90%  will show  a synchronised  heat  on days  3 and 4 following  
the second  administration.  All beated  animals  may be checked  for heat and 
inseminated  on the basis  of an observed  heat. Alternatively,  all animals  may be 
inseminated  at 72 and again  at 96 hours  after  the second  injection.  The overall  
pregnancy  rate is similar  for both insemination  regimens.
2. Short-term  progestagen  treatment
This is based  on the adminisbation  of oesbogen,  which  causes  regression  of 
recently  formed  corpora  lutea  and endogenous  progesterone  to decline.  At the 
same time natural  progesterone  is administered  exogenously  to simulate  the 
function  of the corpus  luteum. All animals  are then under the influence  of 
progesterone  in a simulated  luteal  phase.  Following  removal  of the progesterone  
all animals  enter the follicular  phase  together  giving  a synchronised  heat and 
ovulation  response.  The above  treatment  is commercially  available  as proges ­
terone  releasing  inbavaginal  devices  PRIDs.  For the standard  synchronisation  
beatment  the PRID  is inserted  for 12 days  and the cows  are inseminated  twice  
at 48 and again  at 72 hours  following  PRID  removal.  Alternatively,  as with
98
prostaglandin  treatment,  animals  may be checked  for heat  and inseminated  on 
the basis of an observed  heat. The overall  pregnancy  rate is similar  for both 
insemination  regimens.  More  recently  it has been  demonstrated  that  by admini ­
stering  prostaglandin  24 hours  before  PRID  removal  that the duration  of the 
treatment  period  can be reduced  from 12 days to 7 to 9 days. Furthermore,  the 
heat  response  is more  synchronised  thus  leading  to higher  pregnancy  rates  to the 
fixed  time insemination.
Choice  of synchronization  method
For cyclic  heifers,  the double  prostaglandin  regimen  is probably  the most  
convenient  and  cost  effective  method.  For  suckler  cows  the use of prostaglandin  
is not recommended  because  a high proportion  of cows would  not have a 
functional  corpus  luteum  at the time  of synchronization  and,  therefore,  would  not 
respond.  While  PRIDs  are effective  in synchronising  heat  in cyclic  animals,  their  
effectiveness  for inducing  heat in non-cyclic  post-partum  cows is somewhat  
variable.  This variability  is related  to the interval  post-partum  and the depth  of 
anoestrum.  A combined  progestagen  and gonadotrophin  (PMSG)  treatment  has 
been developed  at Belclare,  particularly  for use in non-cyclic  beef  cows. This 
increases  both the  proportion  of cows  responding  and the ovulation  rate. The  net 
effect  is to increase  the pregnancy  rate by a further  10 to 15% and the twinning  
rate from 2% to 10%.

Lamb  Growth  Rate on Pasture
E. J. GRENNAN
Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
In the spring  lambing  flock,  grass  provides  most  of the feed  requirements  of 
ewes  and lambs  after  lambing  with  little  or no concentrates  being  fed unless  grass  
supply  is deemed  to be very  scarce.  Where  grass  supply  is adequate,  lamb  growth  
rate in April  and May  is generally  satisfactory  but tends  to decline  in June  when  
lambs  are at the 10 to 14 week  age. Lamb  growth  rate post-weaning  is known  
to vary widely  depending  on the type  of the pasture  on offer. The objective  of 
grazing  management  is to provide  grass in sufficient  quantity  and quality  to 
promote  high growth  rate consistent  with good  stocking  rate.
Pasture  quantity
The quantity  of grass on offer to grazing  animals  has been measured  in 
different  ways.  Stocking  rate  is the method  commonly  used  to match  feed  supply  
and demand  but this method  lacks  any definition  of the actual  supply  of grass  on 
offer  at any particular  time. The pasture  allowance  method  is popular  in New  
Zealand.  This involves  measuring  the yield of herbage  in a paddock  before  
grazing  and  offering  a precise  weight  of  grass  dry matter  per sheep  per  day. Fresh  
herbage  is offered  daily  or less frequently.  The  residual  dry matter  method  has 
been  used  in rotational  grazing  to decide  when  stock  should  be moved  to the next 
paddock.  This  involves  measuring  the yield  of herbage  remaining  after  grazing  
a paddock.
In recent  years  the pasture  height  method  has become  popular  as a way of 
judging  the suitability  of pasture  for both  set stocking  and rotational  grazing . It 
has the advantage  at farm level  that no yield  measurement  is required  and with  
a little  experience  pasture  height  can be accurately  gauged  by eye. Pasture  height  
and herbage  allowance  methods  have  been used in grazing  studies  at Belclare.
Lamb  growth;  birth  to weaning
A high growth  rate in lambs  from birth to weaning  is desirable,  leading  to 
heavier  weaning  weights  and earlier  drafting  of lambs thereby  reducing  the 
dependence  on selling  in the peak  months  of  July  to September.  Trials  at Belclare  
over two years examined  some factors  that may affect  lamb growth  rate on 
pasture.
(a) pasture  type: Three  pastures  were compared;  old permanent  pasture  that 
was grazed  by sheep  only  for many  years  (old  pasture);  A reseeded  pasture,  one 
year  old and  grazed  by sheep  in the sowing  year  (new  pasture):  and  old  permanent  
pasture  grazed  by cattle  only in previous  years  (cattle  pasture).
(b) pasture  height:  Each  pasture  was set stocked  from  lambing  to weaning  and 
grazed  at each  of three  heights,  low (3 to 4 cm),  medium  (5 to 6 cm) and high  (8 
to 9 cm).
100
(c) dosing:  Two dosing  frequencies  were  compared:  In one replicate,  lambs  
were  dosed  at 5 and 10 weeks  while  the second  replicate  received  extra  doses  at 
7 /^and  12 weeks.  Mean  lambing  date was March  20 and ewes  and lambs  were  
put  out to pasture  when  lambs  were  a few  days  old. The  pastures  were  rested  over  
winter  and received  45 units of nitrogen  jter acre in February  for early  grass.  
There  were 18 groups  with  9 ewes  and 14 to 15 lambs  per group.  No meals  were  
fed after  lambing.  After  turn-out  the aim was to achieve  target  heights  as soon  
as possible.  Heights  were  maintained  by using  different  size  paddocks  (approx.  
V2, V3 or 1 ha per group),  adjusting  padd^k  sizes  using  moveable  electric  fences,  
occasional  use of non-experimental  dry sheep,  and topping  of pastures  as 
required.
Results
Pasture  type: Lamb  growth  rate to weaning  was similar  on old and reseeded  
sheep  pasture  when  grazed  at the same  height  (Table  1). This  confirms  that  good  
growth  rates can be sustained  on permanent  pasture  under intensive  sheep  
grazing.
However,  reseeded  pasture  may carry extra stock if grass production  is 
higher.  Growth  rates  on cattle  pasture  were  higher  than  on the other  two  pastures.  
The advantage  to cattle  pasture  was greatest  in the first year  of sheep  grazing^ 
amounting  to about  10 percent  better  ^owth  rate  and  about  3 kg heavier  weaning  
weight  This  higher  weaning  weight  is of considerable  advantage  as it increases  
the number  of lambs  fit for drafting  at weaning.  It is interesting  that  growth  rate 
on the 3 pastures  was  fairly  similar  up to 5 weeks.  The  advantage  to cattle  pasture  
was greatest  from  5 to 10 weeks,  and to a lesser  extent  from 10tol4weeks.  The 
reason  for the better  performance  on catUe  pasture  is not fully  clear,  but is likely  
to be due m part at least to the lower worm burden  on the cattle pasture.  
Parasitological  studies  involving  herbage  larval  counts,  faecal  egg counts,  tracer  
sheep and examination  of lambs  sent to the factory  indicated  lower  worm  
burdens  on the cattle  pasture  in the first year.
The more  intensive  dosing  of lambs  (4 doses)  was  no better  than the standard  
dosing  (2 doses)  even on pasture  grazed  by sheep  every  year.
The  fact that there  was no difference  between  pastures  in the 0 to 5 week  stage  
may not be surprising  as lambs  consume  litUe  grass  at that  age. This fact  can be 
exploited  in a clean-grazing  situation  where  the aim would  be to have clean  
grazmg  available  from 5 weeks  of age (about  mid-April)  with less concern  for 
the 0 to 5 week  stage.
Pasture  height:  Lamb  growth  rate increased  with increasing  pasture  height  on 
all pastures  (Table  2). The  response  to increasing  height  was most  evident  up to 
10 weeks  of age (end  of May),  From  10 to 14 weeks  (June)  the effect  of pasture  
height  was less clear-cut,  with a significant  response  only in year  2. In general  
the medium  pasture  height  of about  6 cm gave  near  maximum  (97%)  growth  rate 
and weaning weight.  Giving  pasture  of less than 4 cm restricted  lamb  growth  
rate to about  89% of their  potential.  However,  grazing  at a height  of about  9 cm 
only improved  growth  rates by 3 to 4 % compared  with the 6 cm and implied
101
using  a considerably  lower  stocking  rate.
The period  after  turn out in spring  is a time  when  grass  is often  scarce  and the 
question  arises as to whether  supplementary  feeding  is needed. While  no 
concentrates  were  fed in this experiment,  they are not likely  to be necessary  if 
pasture  is 5 to 6 cm high but may  be required  where  the height  is 3 to 4 cm.
Lamb  growth  rate from 10 to 14 weeks  (June)  was lower  than from 0 to 10 
weeks  on all pastures  and at all heights.  This  coincides  with the time  when  ewe 
milk  supply  is low and pastures  are getting  stemmy  if under-grazed  in May. In 
this trial  pasture  quantity  and  quality  may  have  affected  growth  rates  in June.  The 
short  grass  was leafy  but scarce  while  the tall grass  was plentiful  but stemmy.  
Lax grazing  (9cm)  in April-May  was no disadvantage  while  grass  was leafy  but 
it leads to a very stemmy  pasture  in June. Ideally  the pasture  should  be 
maintained  at about  6 cms  pre-weaning.  If grass  is higher  in May,  a tight  grazing  
(down  to 3 to 4 cm)  at the end  of May  would  help  to maintain  the pasture  in a leafy  
state in June.
The average  weaning  weights  of lambs  for 2 years  on diffemet  pastures  and 
at different  heights  are shown  in Table  3. Normal  14 week  weaning  weight  in 
similar  flocks  would  be 31 to 32 kg. The  results  show  the extent  to which  weights  
may be increased  or decreased  depending  on the pasture  type and height.

Lamb  growth  post-weaning
The effect  of pasture  height  and herbage  allowance  on the liveweight  gain  of 
weaned  lambs  was measured  over  a number  of years.
Pasture  height-set  stocking:  Weaned  lambs  were set-stocked  on old perma ­
nent  sheep  pasture  maintained  at different  heights.  Pastures  contained  very  little  
clover.  Lambs  were  dosed  and treated  with  cobalt  every  3 weeks.  Table  4 shows  
the pasture  heights  and  weight  gains  achieved.  It is clear  that  highest  growth  rates  
were obtained  on pastures  grazed  at 8 to 9 cm in the July to September  period.  
Growth  rates  were  lower  in October/November  but there  was a similar  response  
to increasing  pasture  height.
Pasture  height  - rotational  grazing  : In these experiments  lambs were  
rotationally  grazed  on permanent  or reseeded  pastures  of low clover  content.

They  were  generally  8 to 10 cm high  before  grazing  and grazed  down  to heights  
of about  4,5 or 6 cm. Results  show  that  highest  growth  rates  were  obtmned  with 
the highest  herbage  allowances  (Table  5). Growth  rates  also declined  in the late 
autumn  period.  The data  reflect  the wide  range  in growth  rates  that  are obtained  
depending  on the supply  of grass  and the time  of year. The  post-grazing  heights  
indicate  that  highest  gains  were  obtained  where  lambs  did  not  have  to graze  down  
below  about  6 cm on these  pastures.
It is evident  from these  results  that the optimum  pasture  height  was higher  
than  that  required  in spring.  This  is partly  a reflection  of the nature  of the pasture  
at different  times  of the year. In spring  the pasture  is mostly  green  leaf  and lambs  
can perform  well  on short  grass. In summer  and autumn,  on aftermath  or grazed  
pasture,  the lower  layer  of the sward  contains  more  stem  ^d dead  leaf  and lamb  
growth  rate is reduced  if they are forced  to graze  down  into this layer.
Clover : White  clover  is a valuable  component  of the sheep  pastime.  Intake  
and digestibility  are generally  higher  for all-grass  pastures,  and this is reflected  
in higher  lamb  growth  rates  - up to 22 g per day in some  trials.
Conclusions
From  turn-out  until  weaning  a pasture  height  of about  6 cm was  suitable  under  
set-stocking.  Old and reseeded  pastures  gave similar  growth  rates in lambs.  
Growth  rate was about  10% better  on a cattle  pasture  not previously  grazed  by 
sheep. A pasture  height  of 8 to 9 cm was best for weaned  lambs  under  set 
stocking,  or grazing  down  to about  6 cm for rotational  grazing.

Exploiting  the Ram Effect  for Early  
Breeding  : Effects  of Ewe  Age and Breed
J. P. HANRAHAN  and E. G. OTIIORDAN  
Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam,  Co. Galway
Under  appropriate  conditions  anestrous  ewes  can be stimulated  to ovulate  by 
the introduction  of rams  following  a period  of isolation  from  males  (Pearce  and 
Oldham,  1984).  If such  ewes  are pretreated  with  a progesterone,  oestrus  will  also 
be induced  following  ram introduction.  Thus a synchronised  mating  can be 
induced  in advance  of the onset  of the normal  breeding  season  without  the use 
of an exogenous  gonadotrophin  such as PMSG.  There  is a broad similanty  
between  the events  preceding  puberty  in ewe  lambs  and the onset  of the breeding  
season  in ewes  and there is some  evidence  that ewe lambs  can respond  to the 
introduction  of rams in the same  way as adult  ewes (Drymundsson  and Lees,  
1972).
Two experiments  were conducted  to examine  the possible  role of the ram 
effect  in advancing  the date  of mating  in ewes  and in ewe lambs.  The objective  
of the study  with adult  ewes  was to test the utility  of the ram effect  for inducing  
a synchronised  mating  in ewes  about  5 weeeks  in advance  of the exp)ected  date 
of onset  of the breeding  season. The study with ewe lambs  was designed  to 
examine  the susceptibility  of this age group  to the ram effect  and how this is 
influenced  by the time  of ram introduction  relative  to expected  date  of puberty.
Materials  and Methods
Experiment  1: The adult  ewes  used in this experiment  were  from  either  the 
Belclare  or Finn-Dorset  breeds.  The  onset  of the breeding  season  is known  to be 
earlier  in Finn-Dorset  ewes  (August  25th)  than in the Belclare  breed  (September  
15th (Hanrahan,  1986).  The  experiment  was designed  to compare  the responses  
of these  two breeds  to ram introduction  in mid-August  and also to compare  the 
performance  of Belclare  ewes  given  PMSG  with those  not given  PMSG.  All 
ewes had MAP  spenges  inserted  on August  5th and these were removed  on 
August  16th at which  time fertile  rams  were  introduced.  The ram to ewe ratio  
was 1:9. Half  of the Belclare  ewes  were  given  750 i.u. PMSG  at spwnge  removal.  
Matings  were  recorded  daily and all ewes  were  subjected  to laparoscopy  on day 
9 following  ram introduction  to measure  ovulation  rate. The  rams  were  removed  
at this stage.
Experiment  2: This  study  utilised  Belclare  and Belclare  x Galway  ewe lambs  
bom in March/April.  Previous  studies  with  ewe  lambs  of these  two breed  typ)es  
had shown  that  mean  date  of first  ovulation  is between  mid-  to late-October  with 
first  oestrus  being  observed  about  3 weeks  later  in early  November  (Fitzsimons  
and Hanrahan,  1984;  Hantrahan  eta/.,  1985).  The  experiment  involved  exposing  
ewe lambs,  which  had been isolated  from contact  with rams for at least one 
month,  to fertile  rams  and recording  the ovulation  response,  by endoscopy  on 
day 6 following  ram  introduction.  Ewe  lambs  were  assigned  to one  of five  groups
105
on a within  breed  basis. Rams  were intnxiuced  to Groups  1, 2, 3 and 4 on 
September  27th, October  4th, October  11th and October  18th, respectively.  
Group  5 was kept in isolation  from rams until October  25th. Once  rams were  
introduced  to a group  they remained  with that group  until all the rams were  
withdrawn  on December  6th. TTie ewe lambs in the Control  group were  
examined  by endoscopy  on the same  day as each  of the Groups  1 to 4. Date  of 
first  oestrus  was recorded  by daily  checks  for mating  marks  and ovulation  rate 
was recorded  within  10 days  of first oestrus.
Results
Experiment  1: The performance  of ewes  in each  of the experimental  groups  
is summarised  in Table  1. All ewes  had active  corpora  lutea  at endoscopy.  The 
difference  among  the groups  was small  except  for ovulation  rate which  was 
increased  significantly  by PMSG  administration.  The differences  in litter size 
reflected  the ranking  on ovulation  rate  but it is clear  that  the PMSG  group  showed  
only  a small  gain  relative  to the controls.  The average  number  of lambs  bom  per 
ewe  joined  showed  an advantage  of 0.16 for ewes  treated  with PMSG.

Experiment  2 : The average  body  weight  of the ewe lambs  used  was 42 kg in 
October  and 44 kg at ram removal  in early  December.  The  effect  of joining  date 
on the proportion  of ewe lambs  which  responded  to ram introduction  is shown  
in Table  2. The  results  show  that  ewe  lambs  failed  to respond  on September  27th 
but there  was a clear  effect  of ram introduction  on October  4 th and October  11th.  
By October  18th ovarian  activity  had commenced  in almost  all the isolated  ewe 
lambs.  Aspects  of the subsequent  reproductive  performance  are summarised  in

♦Controls
Table 3. It is evident  that date  of first  estrus  was  effected  by the joining  s trategy  
adopted  with estrus  onset  occurring  significantly  earlier  in the group  joined  on 
October  4th than in the group first exposed  to rams one week earlier  on 
September  27 th. It is not possible  to estimate  from  this  experiment  the maximum  
advance  in date of first estrus  which  could  be obtained  by exploiting  the ram 
effect  but it is suggested  that an advance  of 2 weeks  is probable  near  the upper  
limit for the type of sheep  used in this study.
An interesting  feature  of the experiment,  which  is apparent  from  an examina ­
tion of date  of first  estrus  in the ewe lamb  which  responded  to the ram  on October  
4th and October  18th, is that they can be subdivided  into two subgroups.  One 
subgroup displayed  first  estrus  about  17 days  centered  around  23 days  post  ram 
introduction.  Out of 38 ewe  lambs  which  could  be assigned  to the first  subgroup  
(mean interval to estrus  was 17.2 days,  s.d. = 0.9),  while  14 were  assigned  to the 
second  subgroup  (mean  interval  23.2,  s.d. = 0.80). A total of 8 ewe lambs  had 
intervals  to first  estrus  which  were  inconsistent  with  these  two subgroups  (6 with 
short intervals,  1 to 11 days,  and 2 with long intervals,  28 to 36 days). These  
results  are interpreted  to mean  that  about  50%  of ewe  lambs  which  respond  to ram 
introduction  produce  normal  corpora  lutea  and  display  estrus  when  these  regress  
after about  13 to 14 days. In the other  subgroup  the corpora  lutea formed  in 
response  to ram introduction  regress  within  6 to 7 days of ram inuoduction  
followed  by a second  ovulatory  event  but without  an associated  estrus. First  
estrus  then occurs  16-17  days later.
The ewe lambs  exposed  to rams  on September  27th clearly  did not respond,  
as judged  by the incidence  of ewes  with corpora  lutea  at the endoscopy  6 days  
after ram  introduction.  However,  there  is evidence  that these  ewes  exhibited  a 
delayed  response  to rams.  Thus  the date  of first  estrus  is the same  as for the group  
first exposed  to rams on October  11. Secondly,  these ewe lambs  were re­
examined  by endoscopy  on October  12th together  with their  controls  - on that 
occasion  35% had corpora  lutea compared  with 8% of the Control  lambs
(P<0-10).  . r uThe  ovulation  rale at first  estrus  was  consistent  with  previous  results  tor these  
breeds.  There  is a suggestion  that  the ovulation  rate is lower  in ewe  lambs  which  
responded  to ram introduction  but the differences  were not significant.  The
107
conception  rate at at first estrus  averaged  70%. The average  ovulation  rate of 
1 lambs  at conception  was 1.68±0.06  and the resulting  litter  size was
1.42^.06.  The  predicted  litter  size using  ovulation  rate  and the average  embryo  
suryivd  in adult  ewes  (Hanrahan,  1982)  is 1.49. Thus  there  is no indication  of 
senously  impaired  embryo  survival  in those  ewe  lambs  which  conceived  at first 
est^s. The overall  conception  rate in this study was 89% which is quite  
satisfactory  given  the length  of the joining  period.
Conclusion
The ability  of Belclare  ewes  to respond  to ram introduction  about  5 weeks  
pnor  to the normal  date of onset  of the breeding  season  is such that they can be 
successfully  mated at this time without  the use of PMSG. The overall  
productivity  of such ewes  was only slightly  less than comparable  ewes which  
were given  750.  i.u. PMSG  and did not differ  from that of Finn-Dorset  ewes  
despite  the earlier  onset  of the breeding  season  in the latter  breed.
Ewe  lambs  can respond  to ram introduction  within  5-6 weeks  of  expected  date 
of first  estrus.  However,  the transition  between  the state  of not responding  to ram 
introduction  and responsiveness  appears  to occur  very  rapidly.  The ram effect  
can be exploited  to advance  and synchronise  first estrus  in ewe lambs  and thus 
ensure  that  parturition  is at the same  time  as the adult  ewes  in seasonal  production  
systems.

Reseeding  Grassland
N. CULLETON
Teagasc,  Johnstown  Castle,  Co. Wexford.
Grassland  occupies  some 89% of the arable  land in Ireland  and of this 
approximately 3%  is reseeded  annually  (Culleton,  1989). Many  of our perma ­
nent  pastures  have  very  poor  botanical  composition  and  Frame  and  Tilley  (1988)  
pointed out that quantity  and quality  of secondary  grass  species  are inferior  to 
Lolium  perenne.  Nonetheless,  there  is evidence  that permanent  pastures  have  
high animal  production  potential  and that the large  response  to reseeding  in the 
first harvest  year  is rapidly  lost (Wilkins,  Hopkins  and Dibb,  1987).
Why  Reseed?
The first  part  of this paper  reports  on an experiment  conducted  at Johnstown  
Castle  which  compared  old pasture  to a new reseed  under  both grazing  and 
conservation  conditions.  The botanical  composition  of the old sward  at the 
beginning  of the trial is given  in Table  1. The perennial  ryegrass  content  was 
about  3.5%.  The  soil  fertility  was  improved  and  perennial  ryegrass  cv. Vigor  was 
sown  in autumn.  Both  new and old pastures  were  rotationally  grazed  for each  
of 3 years. The results  of the grazing  trial are summarised  in Table  2.

In year  1, the old pasture  gave  75 % as m uch output  in terms  of liveweight  gain/  
ha as the new  pasture.  However,  by year  3 there  were  no significant  differences  
between  the new and the old pastures.  The ryegrass  content  in the old pasture  
increased  steadily  and by the end of year 3, ryegrass  accounted  for almost  32% 
of the sward.
The  results  from the silage  component  of the trial are given  in Table  3. In the 
first, second  and third years the old sward  produced  62%, 84%, 79% of the 
production  from the new sward.  Unlike  the grazing  sward  the yield  difference  
between  the new and old pasture  remained  for the duration  of the trial. In terms  
of digestibility,  the old pasture  was significantly  poorer  than the new pasture.  
Table  1 shows  that the botanical  composition  of the old silage  sward  at the end 
of the silage  trial did not significantly  improve  at all. This is in marked  contrast  
to the grazing  sward,  where significant  improvements  in ryegrass  content  
occurred.

The structure  of the grazing  and the silage  sward  tended  to be quite  different  
from  each other. Table  4 summarises  the relevant  data. At the end of the trial,  
97% of the grass  in the new sward  was ryegrass  under  the grazing  regime,  while  
there  was only 75%  ryegrass  in the silage  regime.  The grazing  sward  had more  
tillers/m^  than the silage  sward.  It appears  that  ryegrasses  prefer  a grazing  regime  
to a silage  cutting  regime.  Even  with  good  management  silage  swards  deteriorate  
with time.
It can be concluded  that the main  niche  for reseeding  is in the conservation,  
rather  than the grazing  areas.  Grazing  areas  should  only  be reseeded  when  there  
is no ryegrass  present,  or improvements  in fertility  in the existing  sward  have  not 
already  led to significant  improvements  in productivity.
Methodology  of reseeding
Three  aspects  of reseeding  are now discussed  :
— Autumn  reseeding
— Direct  drilling
— Slurry  seeding
Autumn  reseeding
Ploughing  and reseeding  in autumn  are becoming  progressively  more  popu ­
lar, with 4045%  of total reseeding  being  carried  out from mid August  to mid 
September.  In general,  autumn  reseeding  is a reliable  method.  Timing  of sowing  
was the subject  of a trial carried  out at Johnstown  Castle.  There  were  two dates  
of sowing,  September  3 and October  4. Seedling  emergence  and tiller counts/

m^were  monitored  in the months  after  sowing  and the results  are summarised  in 
Table 4
Some  73.6%  of the seedlings  emerged  from the early  autumn  sown  seeds,  
while  only 55.3%  emerged  from the later  sown  seeds. The numbers  of tillers  in 
mid-March  were  significantly  lower  in the  later  sown  crop  than in the early  one. 
The yield  in mid-March  was also significantly  lower. This agrees  with results  
of Culleton,  Keane  and Lemaire  (1988)  who  showed  that swards  with high  tiller  
numbers  reached  appreciate  yield levels significandy  earlier  in spring  than 
swards  with low tiller  numbers.
As shown  earlier,  silage  swards  tend  to have  lower  tiller  numbers  than  grazing  
swards  mainly  because,  for much  of the grazing  season,  tillering  is restricted  due 
to low levels  of light  reaching  the sward  base  (Garwood,  1969).  Culleton,  Keane  
and Lemaire  (1988)  piointed  out that persistency  of silage  swards  is influenced  
by tiller numbers,  in that swards  with low tiller  numbers  allow  an invasion  of 
unsown  species,  thereby  reducing  overall  persistency.  It can be concluded  that 
silage  swards  should  have  high  tiller  numbers  at the onset  of the growing  season  
and therefore,  when  reseeding  forsilage,  it is imperative  that  reseeding  be carried  
out early  in autumn,  so that tillering  can proceed  during  winter.
Generally,  fields  are ploughed  because  they are infested  with docks  and/or  
bent grasses. It is good practice  to spray these fields with Round-Up.  The 
Round-Up  kills  these  persistent  weeds  and  also  benefits  the reseed  in other  ways.  
Table  5 shows  that  spraying  before  ploughing  can help  to conserve  moisture  and 
thereby  aid establisment.  Osciella  Frit control  is also made  less difficult  by 
spraying.

Autumn  management
As already  stated,  one of the major problems  with silage swards  is the 
progressive  reduction  in tiller  numbers  over  the years.  This  leads  to weed  ingress  
and sward  deterioration.  One method  of slowing  down this deterioration  is 
through  the autumn  management  of the sward.  Table  6 summarises  the effects  
of autumn  grazing  by sheep  on the tiller  density  of the sward.

By grazing  the grass  frequently  throughout  the autumn,  light is allowed  to 
penetrate  into the base  of the sward.  This encourages  tillering  to occur. When  
the grass  is not grazed  the sward  can enter  the winter  too tall (this  has happened  
in 1988,1989  and 1990  due to mild  winters).  This  tall grass  causes  a reduction  
in light intensity  reaching  the sward  base  and tillering  is restricted.  By correct  
autumn  management  of the silage  sward  the cycle  of sward  deterioration  leading  
to ploughing  and reseeding  can be slowed  down  significantly.
Direct  drilling
In many  situations  it is not  possible  to plough.  The land  is too stoney,  the soil 
is too shallow,  or perhaps  there  is no tradition  for ploughing.  Nonetheless,  the 
botanical  composition  of many  silage  swards  in these  areas  is poor. Because  
ploughing  was  not  an option,  to date  there  has  been  no easy  method  for upgrading  
these  pastures.  The introduction  of direct  drilling  has given  the opportunity  of 
introducing  perennial  ryegrasses  into native  swards  without  ploughing.
The management  before,  during  and after  drilling  needs  to be of a very high  
standard.  Table  7 summarises  the main  points  in the management  package.
Table  7

Pre-sowing — adequate  soil fertility

During  sowing — anti-slug  pellets

— Herbicides
Post sowing — tight grazing 
strategic  use of nitrogen
112
Pre-sowing  There  is little  point  in drilling  if soil fertility  is low. Ryegrass  
seed does not thrive  below  a pH of 5.8, or a phosphorus  level  of below  3 ppm.  
Drilling  is most successful  after a heavy  silage  crop has been removed.  The 
regrowth of the native  sward  after silage  is significantly  slower  than that after  
tight grazing. The sown seedlings  have a better  chance  to establish  before  
competition  from the native  swards  becomes  intense.
During  sowing Anti-slug  pellets  are essential.  It is important  to use 
vigorous  seeds.  Seeds  with  high  germinability  should  be used. L^ge  seeds  tend 
to germinate  and emerge  more  rapidly  than small seeds. Table  8 summarises  
results  on rate  of seeding  emergence  among  the differentcategories  of ryegrasses.

Herbicides  can be used for complete  kill of the native  sward. The problem  
with  this approach  is that  pest  control  in the new  sward  can be difficult.  A further  
problem  is that the row spacing  of the current  drilling  machines  is too wide  for 
single  pass  operations.  Suppression  of the native  sward  by low rates  of herbicide  
application  is a useful  technique  to reduce  competition  from native  sward  and 
allow  the seedlings  to grow. If pre-sowing  management  has been  correct,  it is 
possible  to drill successfully  without  the use of herbicides.
Post sowing It is very important  to keep  the native  sward  under  control  
while  the seedlings  are establishing.  This can be done  by high stocking  at 2-3 
week intervals.  Over  the past few years,  the main cause  of failure  has been the 
lack of adequate  grazing  post-drilling.  Stock  also have  the effect  of spreading  
the plants  across  the inter  row spaces  by trampling.
Results  of trials  carried  out at Johnstown  Castle  are summarised  in Table  9. 
It is clear that ploughing  and reseeding  in the conventional  way give the best 
results  but the direct  drilling  plots  did give  yields  that were  significantly  greater  
than the control  plots.

Slurry  seeding
Trials  on slurry seeding  of Italian  ryegrass  into existing  Italian  ryegrass  
swards  were  carried  out at Johnstown  Castle  from 1980  to 1988.
Table 10 shows  typical  Italian  ryegrass  yields  in comparison  to perennial  
ryegrass.  In the years  immediately  after  sowing  yields  are very  high  but by year 
4-5 yields  decline  to those  of jjerennial  ryegrass.  Because  four  cuts per year  are 
necesary  to maintain  good  quality,  it is imperative  that yields  be maintained  at 
high levels

Normally,  high yields  are maintained  by ploughing  and reseeding  every  two 
to three  years. This is becoming  an expensive  opieration  and work  at Johnstown  
has been  aimed  at maintaining  high  prxxluctivity  without  ploughing  and reseed ­
ing by slurry  seeding.  In September  of each  year,  after  the last cut of silage  was 
taken,  15 kg seed/ha  were  sown  using  a fertiliser  spinner.  Cattle  slurry  at the rate 
of 35 m’/ha (3000  gal/acre)  was then spread.  When the seedlings  had established  
the sward  was grazed  lightly  and frequently  until  the land  was too wet for grazing  
in late autumn.  The results  are summarised  in Table  11.

The slurry seeding  gave significantly  higher  yields throughout  the trials.  
However,  yields  were  always  lower  than the yields  achieved  in the early  years  
of the trial. The technique  is very weather  dependent.  A drought  in the 
immediate  aftermath  of slurry  seeding  can cause  complete  failure. Table 12 
shows  that Italian  ryegrass  is a large seed and it is thus very vigorous  in the 
establishment  phase.  The sward  of Italian  ryegrass  is very  open  with  a low tiller  
density.  Thus,  it is easy  for the seed  to come  in contact  with  the soil and establish  
without  undue  interference  from the native  sward. Despite  this, the technique  
was only moderately  successful.  The chances  of success  of slurry seeding  
perennial  ryegrass  into an old {yeimanent  pasture  would  be quite  poor.

Grasses  for reseeding
Table  13 shows  the sales  of the various  types  of ryegrass  over  the past  number  
of years.  There  has been  a significant  swing  away  from  the use of early  perennial  
ryegrasses.  The  main  reasons  for this  are the poor  tillering  ability  of early  grasses  
leading  to open swards  and the consistent  steminess  in mid-season.

In general  terms, late perennials  are typical  grazing  grasses. They are 
prostrate  in growth  habit,  high  tillering,  giving  a very  dense  sward  and they  tend 
to be leafy in mid-summer.  They are also extremely  persistent.  Mid-season  
ryegrasses  are upright  and are reasonably  persistent.  They are described  as 
typical  silage  grasses.
In designating  mixtures  it is important  that the requirements  of the mixture  be 
matched  against  the characteristics  of the maturity  groups.  If silage  is required  
then the dominant  component  of the mixture  should  be made  up of mid-seasons,  
with the  minor  component  being  made  up of the late perennials,  which  fulfd  the 
function  of filling  in the base  of the sward  If the requirement  is mainly  grazing,  
late perennial  ryegrasses  should  be used  with some  mid-seasons  being  included  
to make  the mixture  a little earlier  growing  in spring.

Grazing  Management  Strategies  for 
Beef  Cattle
I. A. WRIGHT
Macaulay  Land Use Research  Institute,  Pentlandfield,  Roslin,  
Midlothian  EH25  9RF,  Scotland
One  of the key ways  of improving  the profitability  of beef  production  systems  
is to improve  the efficiency  of grassland  utilization  by good grazing  manage ­
ment. The aim of grazing  management  is to convert  pasture  resources  into 
animal  product  in the most  efficient  way  possible.  This  requires  a knowledge  of 
the way in which  animals  respond  to different  sward  conditions  and the way in 
which  swards  respond  to grazing  by animals.  Research  work  over the past 10 
years  has led to considerable  progress  in both  these  areas. The  aim of this paper  
is to outline  how this research  can be used in a practical  way to improve  the 
efficiency  of grazing  systems  for beef  cattle.
Sward  height
In general,  the height  of the surface  of the sward  is a good  indicator  of how 
much grass is present,  although  the relationship  between  sward height  and 
herbage  mass does vary with the density  of the sward. A simple  tool for 
measuring  sward  height  known  as the HTOO  swardstick  has been develojied  
(Barthram,  1986). Using  this device  30 to 50 measurements  can be taken  in a 
field relatively  quickly.
Herbage  intake  and animal  performance
Sward  height  has a large  effect  on the intake  and  performance  of cattle.  Under  
continuous  grazing  maximum  herbage  intakes  by beef  cows  are obtained  when  
the sward  height  is 9-10  cm or more  (Table  1).

Since  sward  height  affects  herbage  intake,  then not unexpectedly  there  is a 
close relationship  between  sward height  and live-weight  gain (Wright  and 
Whyte,  1989).  Figure  1 shows  the live-weight  gains  of  beef  cows  and  their  calves  
when  grazed  continuously  on swards  of different  heights.  On swards  of less than 
6 cm the cows  lost  considerable  amounts  of weight.  At higher  sward  heights  cow 
live-weight  gain  increased  and reached  a maximum  at a sward  height  of 8-10  cm . 
Beyond  that  height  the cow live-weight  gain was reduced.  Calf  live-weight  gain

showed  a very  similar  pattern  of response  reaching  a maximum  at a sward  height  
of about  10 cm. As the calves  became  older  and less dependent  on milk  and more  
dependent  on herbage,  their  growth  rates  became  more  sensitive  to sward  height,  
as indicated  by the steeper  slope of the curve for August-September,  but 
maximum  live weight  gain still occurred  at a sward  height  of 9-10  cm. Similar  
responses  have been observed  with autumn  calving  cows and their calves  
(Wright,  Whyte  and Osoro,  1990)  (Table  2).

With 14-18 month-old  cattle  a sward  height  of 4.3 cm depressed  herbage  
intake  by 21% and live-weight  gain by 40%  compared  to that on a sward  at 6.8 
cm (Wright,  Russel  and Hunter,  1986)  (Table  3).

Herbage  utilization
Grazing  management  also influences  the way in which  swards  are utilised.  
Close  grazing  leads  to a rapid  increase  in the number  of tillers  in the spring.  It 
also results in high levels of herbage  production  with the elimination  of 
reproductive  tillers  and seed  heads.  By maintaining  a leafy  sward  with  few seed 
heads  the organic  matter  digestibility  of the grazing  herbage  remains  high,  and 
on perennial  ryegrass  it can be maintained  at between  75 and 80%  for most  of the 
grazing  season.
When sward surface  height  increases  beyond  8 cm, cattle do not graze  
uniformly.  Instead  they concentrate  their grazing  on some areas, rejecting  
others.  TTiese ungrazed  areas go to seed  and the digestibility  declines  dramati ­
cally. At a sward  height  of 8 cm the sward  soon  reaches  a state  where  less than  
10% of the area is rejected,  but at 12 cm a large  proportion  of the area is rejected  
in the early  part  of the season  (Wright  and Whyte,  1989)  and the sward  becomes  
'patchy'  in appearance.  The ungrazed  patches  go to seed  and later in the season  
the cattle  are forced  to graze  this material  of poor  quality  and low digestibility  
and this is the reason  for the decline  in cow live-weight  gain at swards  in excess  
of 8 to 10 cm (Figure  1).
118
Sward  height  targets
Target  sward  heights  for beef  cattle  are given  in Table  4.

A sward  height  of 6-8 cm should  be achieved  as soon  as possible  in spring  and 
the height  should  be maintained  at no more  than 8 cm until  mid-summer  to avoid  
seed head  development  Once  the risk of seed head  development  is past,  sward  
height  can be allowed  to increase  to 10-14  cm. These  heights  will ensure  high  
levels  of grassland  utilization  and high  levels  of animal  performance.  In autumn  
it is important  to graze  swards  down  to 4 cm to avoid  'winter  kill'.
Control  of swards  height  and forage  conservation
Given  a background  of herbage  growth  rates  that  change  not only  seasonally,  
but vary  within  a season  on a week-to-week  basis  as a result  of climatic  variation  
and fertilizer  regime,  some  means  of varying  stocking  rate needs  to be found  if 
sward  height  is to be controlled.
This can be achieved  by integrating  grazing  and conservation.  Instead  of 
setting aside  a fixed  area  of grassland  for grazing  and a separate  area for fodder  
conservation,  there is a need for a flexible  approach.  If on the area initially  
allocated  to grazing  sward  heights  are too high,  then part of it can be closed  off 
for conservation.  Similarly,  if sward  heights  are too low, then an extra  area of 
grassland  can be incorporated  into the grazing  area. S uch an approach  to grazing  
management  has been tested  at the Macaulay  Land Use Research  Institute.  
Sward  heights  are maintained  by regular  adjustment  of the area available  for 
giving  at least during  the period  of conservation  (up until mid-August).  The 
striking  feature  of this approach  is the consistency  of performance  that can be 
achieved  from year to year. Table  5 shows  calf  weaning  weights  over  a three-  
year  period  when  sward  heights  were  maintained  at 7-8 cm during  the period  of 
conservation  and when  overall  stocking  rate was 2.5 cows/ha.  This  stability  over 
years  was achieved  in years  which  were  considered  to be both 'good'  and 'bad' 
grazing  seasons,  and yet the variation  is largely  removed  from individual  animal  
performance  and output.
Table  5

By controlling  sward  height  in this way,  rather  than setting  aside  a fixed  area 
for forage  conservation,  there  will be some  variation  in the area cut and thus in 
winter  fodder  production.  However  the results  in Table  5 indicate  that over a 
three  year  period  the total  area  cut (first  plus second  cut) varied  from  56 to 62%.  
Thus the variation  is not as great  as might  be expected  and can if required  be 
overcome  by varying  the level  of supplementation  in winter.
Conclusions
Sward  height  is a simple,  easy  way to make  measurement  that  can be used  as 
the basis  on which  to manage  grazing  systems.  It provides  an index  of herbage  
production,  pasture  utilization  and animal  performance.  Through  the grazing  
season  target sward heights  for different  types of livestock  under  different  
regimes  can be achieved  by integrating  the grazing and conservation  
programmes  on the farm. The results  of adopting  this approach  are that levels  
of animal  performance  and output  become  very  predictable  and planning  of the 
enterprise  is much  easier.

Whole-Crop  Fodder-Beet  Silage:  
Research  Results

Fodder  beet  can produce  20 tonnes  of dry matter/ha  in one harvest  compared  
with 13 tonnes  of dry matter  from four cuts of grass. Fodder  beet silage  is also 
highly  digestible  (80-85%  DMD)  when soil contamination  is low. Conse ­
quently,  even though  production  costs  are high,  it can be a cost  effective  "fodder  
concentrate" . The  research  reported  in this  paper  is the first  stage  of  a programme  
to develop  an integrated  nutritional  package  based  on whole  crop fodder  beet 
silage  (WCFBS).
Fodder  beet  was harvested  using  a fodder  beet  silage  harvester  and ensiled  in 
a conventional  walled  silo. The chemical  composition  of the silage  is given  in 
Table  1.

Whole  crop  fodder  beet  underwent  an extensive  lactic  acid  fermentation  in the 
silo. Ethanol  production  and residual  levels  of water soluble  carbohydrates  
(WSC)  were high. Crude  protein  and fibre levels  were lower  than would  be 
expected  from  grass  silage.  Although  thet/i  vitro  DMD  value  was  lower  than  was 
anticipated,  this is partly  explained  by the high levels  of ash.
A large scale animal  production  experiment  was carried  out in which  the 
following  treatments  were  compared:
121
1. Grass  silage  {ad libitum)  + 4 kg concentrates/day .
2. Whole  crop fodder  beet silage  (ad libitum)  + 1 kg barley/day.
3. Whole  crop fodder  beet silage  {ad libitum)  + 1 kg soyabean/day.
4. Concentrates  {ad libitum)  (i.e. barley  beef).
The dietary  regimes  are described  in more  detail  in Table  2. These  regimes  
were  intended  to eliminate  possible  nutritional  problems  such  as availability  of 
a long fibre source,  inadequate  phosphorus  or too rapid fermentation  in the 
rumen.

Feed intake  and animal  performance  data are summarized  in Table  3. The 
highest  level  of animal  performance  was attained  by the barley  beef  group  and 
the lowest  level  by the animals  offered  grass  silage  + concentrates.  Both  groups  
on the WCFBS  diets  were intermediate,  with no apparent  benefit  attributable  to 
protein  supplementation.

At this Stage  the high  nutritive  value  of whole  crop  fodder  beet  silage  has been  
confirmed.  Further  experiments  are required  to determine  the requirement  for 
supplementary  protein  under  a wider  range  of circumstances.  In addition  the 
need for a supplementary  source  of long fibre and the mineral  and buffer  
requirements  (if any) need to be clarified,  as well as the effects  on intake  and 
performance  of soil (ash)  contamination.
Although  the whole  volume  of effluent  produced  by fodder  beet  silage  has not 
been properly  quantified,  it appears  to be much higher  than occurs  with that 
produced  by grass  silage  under  normal  conditions.  In addition,  fodder  beet  silage  
effluent  has a high content  of nutrients  and is therefore  too valuable  a feedstuff  
to waste.
In a second  experiment  Friesian  steers  were  offered  unwilted  grass  silage  (ad 
libitum),  fresh  water  and 1 kg rolled  barley/head  daily. Twenty  animals  had ad 
libitum  access  to the effluent  from whole  crop fodder  beet silage  (composition  
in Table  4) while  a further  20 had not. Fodder  beet silage  effluent  had a higher  
DM content  and lower  ash and crude  protein  levels  than effluent  from grass  
silage. The animal  performance  results,  summarised  in Table 5, show that 
liveweight  gains,  adjusted  for differences  in gut-fill  between  the two treatments,  
were improved  by intake  of effluent.  The effluent  from whole  crop fodder  beet 
silage  clearly  has a high nutritive  value  and should  be used as a feedstuff  rather  
than be spread  on grassland.  The next  research  objective  is the incorporation  of 
this effluent  into a diet along  with fodder  beet silage.

The major  conclusions  from the experiments  reported  here are :
(a) It is relatively  easy  to achieve  good  preservation  of whole  crop  fodder  beet 
silage,  despite  soil contamination.
(b) High intakes  and good  animal  performance  can be achieved  where  whole  
crop  fodder  beet  silage  is fed as ^e major  component  of the diet. The  effects  
of reducing  ash levels  are, as yet, unproven.
(c) No response  to protein  supplementation  was achieved  when  a crop with 
healthy  leaves  was ensiled.
(d) Fodder  beet  silage  effluent  has a high  nutritive  value  and should  be used  as 
a feedstuff  rather  than as a fertiliser.

Crossbreeding  of Friesian  Dairy  Cows
M. G. KEANE
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
According  to Central  Statistics  Office  data,  total  cow  numbers  were2,088,300  
in June 1990. Of these, 1,463,600  (70.1%)  were dairy cows,  predominantly  
Friesians.  The  Cattle  Artificial  Insemination  (AI)  Service  carried  out 1,069,482  
inseminations  in 1989. This  represents  about  52%  of all cows  but when  account  
is taken  of unrecorded  "Do it Yourseir  inseminations  and of the fact that there  
is always  a small  proportion  of cows  which  are not bred for various  reasons,  it 
seems  that 55% to 60% of all matings  are by AI. While  there  is no break-down  
of inseminations  by type,  it is widely  accepted  that it is very largely  dairy  cows  
which are inseminat^.
Distribution  of inseminations  by breed
The distribution  of inseminations  by breed  type,  together  with the incidence  
of serious  calving  difficulty,  calf  mortality  within  48 hours  of birth  and gestation  
length  are shown  in Table  1. As would  be expected  because  of the need  to provide  
replacement  heifers  for the dairy  herd,  Friesian  was the predominant  sire breed,  
and represented  37%  of all inseminations.  After  the Friesian,  the early  maturing  
breeds  accounted  for 27% of inseminations  while  the continental  breeds  ac­
counted  for 35%. The  Charolais,  Limousin  and Simmental  at 9-11  % each  made  
up the bulk  of the continentals.  Between  them.  Blonde  d'Aquitaine  and Belgian  
blue accounted  for only 3% of inseminations.  For the Friesian,  Angus  and 
Hereford  breeds,  serious  calving  difficulty  was in the range 1.9% - 2.5%.  
Simmental,  Limousin  and Belgian  blue breeds  were  in the range  4.8%  - 5.4%,  
while  the Charolais  value  was over  6%. The figure  for the Blonde  d'Aquitaine  
is abnormally  high  due  to the inclusion  of  a small  number  of bulls  with  a very  high 
incidence  of calving  difficulty  initially.  Since  1982  however,  the serious  calving  
incidence  from 701 Blonde  d'Aquitaine  calving  records  is 4.4%. For Friesians,

Angus  and Hereford,  mortality  ranged  from 1.5% - 1.8% while for all the 
continentals  it was in the range  2.2%  - 2.8%. Gestation  lengths  for Simmental  
and Belgian  Blue progeny  were 2-3 days longer  than for Friesians,  while  for 
Charolais,  Limousin  and Blonde  d’Aquitaine  progeny  gestation  lengths  were  4- 
5 longer than for Friesians.  In summary,  therefore,  the direct effects  on 
calving  of using a continental  rather  than a traditional  breed  of bull are an 
increase  of 3-4 days in gestation  length,  1% extra  calf mortality  and about  3% 
units  more  calving  difficulty.
Effects  of bull breed  on cow performance
Some  years  ago a major  survey  of Irish  dairy  herds  using  two or more  breeds  
of bull was undertaken.  The comparison  of Friesian,  Hereford,  Charolais  and 
Simmental  bull breeds  is shown  in Table  2. Heifer  data are excluded.  In this 
survey,  breed  of bull had no effect  on lactation  length  or on current  or subsequent  
lactation  yield but all beef bulls extended  the calving  to calving  interval.  
Charolais  and Simmental  sired  calves  were  5-8 kg heavier  at birth  than  Friesian  
and Hereford  sired  calves.

Because  this survey  gave inconclusive  results  on a number  of important  
issues,  a controlled  experiment  was undertaken  to compare  the effects  of mating  
Friesian,  Hereford  and Charolais  bulls  to Friesian  dairy  cows. Although  differ ­
ences  in milk  yield  were  not significant,  there  was a tendency  particularly  for the 
Charolais  bull  to reduce  milk  yield  by 1 % - 2% in both  the current  and subsequent  
lactations  (Table  3). This reduction  can be attributed  mainly  to the fact that the 
Charolais  sired  calves  were  4-5 kg heavier  at birth than Friesian  and Hereford  
sired calves. Surprisingly,  the gestation  length  of Hereford  sired calves  was

similar  to that  for Charolais  sired  calves  and the gestation  lengths  for all three  bull 
breeds  (Table  4) was longer  than  reported  by the Department  of Agriculture  and 
Food  (see  Table  1). While  there  are large  differences  between  bulls  in gestation  
length  of their  progeny,  there  are data  from  Moorepark  (Mee,  1989)  showing  that 
the gestation  length  for Friesians  is about  two days  longer  than indicated  by the 
Department  of Agriculture  and Food (1990)  figures  and there are data from  
Grange  with  once-calved  heifers  showing  that  the gestation  length  for Herefords  
is 2-4 days longer  than indicated  by the Department  of Agriculture  and Food  
figures.  These  gestation  lengths  from  Moorepark  and  Grange  respectively  agree  
with the values  in Table  4. Sire breeds  had no effect  on calving  to first service  
interval  and there  was no difference  between  Friesians  and Herefords  in calving  
to conception.  Following  the birth  of a Charolais  sired  calf  however,  the calving  
to conception  interval  was increased  by about  5 days  and the number  of services  
per conception  was also increased.
In summary,  there  are no adverse  economic  effects  on the dairy  enterprise  
from  the use of a Hereford  bull  compared  with  a Friesian,  despite  the fact  that the 
gestation  interval  is slightly  longer.  Using  bulls  of the large  continental  breeds  
results  in a reduction  of 1-2% in milk yields  due to the longer  gestation  and 
calving  to conception  intervals.  It is also more  difficult  to maintain  a 365 day 
calving  interval.  By way of compensation  the continental  cross calf is 5 kg 
heavier  at birth.
Relationship  between  calving  difficulty  and calf growth  rate
It is widely  believed  that there  is a correlation  between  calving  difficulty  and 
subsequent  performance  of the calves.  This  is based  on the hypothesis  that  calves  
which  grow  most  rapidly  before  birth  would  also  grow  more  rapidly  afterwards  
and vice versa. This reasoning  has led to a belief  amongst  producers  that bulls  
with  a low incidence  of calving  difficulties  produce  inferior  calves  or calves  with 
a high incidence  of calving  difficulties.  This may be the case if bulls were  
selected  only on the basis of single  traits,  but bulls can and are selected  for a 
number  of traits  simultaneously.  Within  the present  approved  A.l. Beef  Bull  List 
(1990)  published  by the Department  of Agriculture  and Food,  there  appears  to 
be no association  between  the relative  breeding  val  ue of a bull for growth  rate  and 
his calving  difficulty  value.  This  is illustrated  in Table  5 which  contains  the mean  
values  for 6 bulls  (2 each Charolais,  Limousin  and Simmental)  in each of four  
categories  - highest  relative  growth  rate, lowest  relative  growth  rate, highest  
calving  difficulty  and lowest  calving  difficulty.  (Individual  bulls  may have  been

included  in more than one category).  The mean data presented  show no 
association  between  calving  difficulty  and  growth  rate. The sixth  highest  growth  
rate bulls  had a mean  relative  growth  rate value  of 115 and a calving  percentage  
of 3.9. The 6 lowest  growth  rate bulls  had a mean  relative  growth  rate value  of 
104 and had a calving  difficulty  percentage  of 4.0. Thus,  the 6 highest  and 6 
lowest  growth  rate bulls had similar  mean calving  difficulty  percentages.  
Similarly,  the 6 highest  calving  difficulty  bulls  had a calving  difficulty  percent ­
age of 6.2 and a relative  growth  rate value  of 109, while  the 6 lowest  calving  
difficulty  bulls  had a calving  difficulty  piercentage  of 2.2 and a relative  growth  
rate value  of 110. While  there  are bulls  with both high calving  difficulties  and 
high  relative  growth  rates  and vice  versa,  the data  in Table  5 show  that there  are 
bulls  with high relative  growth  rate values  and low calving  difficulties.  In fact, 
both the Charolais  bull and the Simmental  bull with the highest  relative  growth  
rate value  had also the lowest  calving  difficulty  percentage.
The absence  of a relationship  between  calving  difficulty  and relative  growth  
rate is further  illustrated  in Tables  6 and 7. In Table  6, the individual  Charolais,  
Limousin  and Simmental  bulls  with their respective  relative  growth  rate diffi­
culty had a somewhat  higher  relative  growth  rate value  than the one with the 
lowest  calving  difficulty,  this was  not the case  for the other  two  breed  types.  The 
two  Limousin  bulls  with  the highest  (7.7%)  and lowest  (2.7%)  calving  difficulty  
had almost  identical  relative  growth  rate values  while  the Simmental  bull with 
the highest  (5.7)  calving  difficulty  had a considerably  lower  relative  growth  rate

(109 V. 117) than the bull with the lowest  (1.8%)  calving  difficulty.  Similarly  
(Table  7), the Charolais  bull with the highest  relative  growth  rate value  had a 
lower  calving  difficulty  (2.6 v. 4.3%)  than the bull with the lowest  relative  
growth  rate. For the Simmental  also, the highest  relative  growth  rate bull had 
only  half  the calving  difficulty  of the lowest  relative  growth  rate  bull. However,  
the highest  relative  growth  rate Limousin  bull had a somewhat  higher  calving  
difficulty  than the lowest  relative  growth  rate Limousin  bull. These  data show  
conclusively  that while  high relative  growth  rate bulls may have high calving  
difficulties  and low calving  difficulty  bulls  may  produce  cdves  of relative  low 
growth  rate,  high  growth  rate  bulls  can  be easy  caving  and  easy  calving  bulls  can 
have high relative  growth  rate values.
Productivity  of less widely  used breeds
Canadian  Hereford : Hereford  bulls  from  Canada  were  imported  into  Ireland  
with  a view  to improving  the productivity  of the Hereford  breed.  There  has been  
little attempt  to quantify  this putative  improvement  particularly  in respect  of 
carcass  characteristics.  As part  of the beef  x dairy  breed  evaluation  programme  
at Grange,  Canadian  Hereford  x Friesians  were  compared  directly  with  Friesians.  
Since  traditional  British  Hereford  x Friesians  had earlier  been compared  with 
Friesians,  it was possible  to make  a comparison  (indirect)  of the two Hereford  
strains.  The  results  of this comparison  are shown  in Tables  8 and  9. The  Friesian  
data were  standardised  to the norm  for a two year  old beef  system  (i.e. carcass  
weight  of 320 kg) and the data for the two Hereford  strains  were adjusted  
accordingly.  At the same  age British  Hereford  crosses  were 7 kg heavier  and

Canadian  Hereford  crosses  were  27 kg heavier  than  Friesians.  Corresponding  
carcass  weight  superiorities  were 10 kg and 22 kg respectively.  Both Hereford  
strains  had killing-out  rates  about  1 % unit  higher  than  Friesians.  However,  even  
though  the Hereford  cross  strains  produced  10 kg and 22 kg more  carcass  they  
produced  2 kg less and only  4 kg more  muscle  respectively  than  Friesians.  This 
was  because  all or practically  all of the extra  carcass  weight  was fat. In summary  
therefore,  compared  with British  Hereford  crosses,  Canadian  Hereford  crosses  
produced  20 kg more liveweight,  12 kg more carcass  weight  and 6 kg more  
muscle  at about  2 years  of age.
Carcass  characteristics  are shown  in Table  9. Both  Hereford  cross  strains  had 
better  conformation,  higher  fat scores,  higher  fat percentages  and lower  muscle  
and bone  percentages  than  Friesians  but there  were  no differences  in any respect  
between  the two Hereford  cross  strain  themselves.  The superior  conformation  
of the Hereford  crosses  was not associated  with  increased  muscle  percentage  (in 
fact it was lower),  larger  muscle  size (as indicated  by longissimus  area)  or more  
higher  value muscle  growth  rate than the British  Hereford  but there were no 
differences  between  the two strains  in carcass  grades  or composition.
Blonde  d'Aquitaine  : Blonde  d'Aquitaine  accounts  for less than 2% of Irish 
inseminations  but it is much  more  widely  used  elsewhere  (Northern  Ireland  and

Holland  for example).  Its performance  (when  crossed  on Friesians)  compared  
with  Friesians  and Limousin  x Friesians  is shown  in Table  10. At about  2 years  
of age Blonde  crosses  were  25 kg liveweight,  15 kg carcass  weight  and 13 kg 
muscle  weight  superior  to Limousin  crosses.  Limousin  crosses  in turn were  9 kg 
carcass  weight  and 17 kg muscle  weight  superior  to Friesians.  Blonde  crosses  
had similar  conformation  to, and a lower  fat score  than Limousin  crosses  (Table  
11). They  also  had less fat, more  muscle  and more  bone  in the carcass.  Both  beef  
crosses  had a slightly  higher  proportion  of higher  value  muscle  and a considera ­
bly greater  muscle  size than Friesians.  In conclusion  both beef  crosses  were  
considerably  superior  to Friesians  in all important  respects  and at the same  age 
Blonde  crosses  were  superior  to Limousin  crosses  in slaughter  weight,  muscle  
weight  and muscle  percentage.

Mouse-Rhine-Yssel  (MRY)  and Belgian  Blue : The MRY is a Dutch  dual 
purpose  breed  which  is reported  to be little  behind  the Friesian  in milk  production  
ability,  but has better  beef  characteristics.  With  the introduction  of milk  quotas,  
a view emerged  that in certain  situations,  crossing  with the MRY  might  be 
appropriate  as it would  maintain  milk production  potential  of the herd while  
improving  beef  merit.
Like  other  continentals,  the Belgian  Blue  breed  was imported  to improve  the 
overall  growth  rate and carcass  characteristics  of catde  from  both the dairy  and 
beef  herd. Because  both the MRY and Belgian  Blue  breeds  were  considered  to

MRY  and Belgian  Blue  bulls. The calving  data are shown  in Table  12. MRY  
and Belgian  Blue sired calves  had gestation  periods  one and two days longer  
respectively  than  Friesians.  Both  MRY  and  Belgian  Blue  calves  had  similar  birth  
weights  (4 kg heavier  than  Friesians)  and as would  be expected,  both  exotics  had 
somewhat  greater  calving  difficulty  with  little  difference  between  the MRY  and 
Belgian  Blue  in this respect.  Overall,  calving  difficulty  was not serious.
Performance  of the progeny  is shown  in Table  13. Compared  with Friesian,  
MRY  X Friesian  steers  were  8 kg liveweight  heavier  at slaughter,  they  had 1.1%  
units  higher  kill-out  so they were 11 kg carcass  weight  heavier.  However,  they  
had only  4 kg extra  muscle.  Belgian  Blue  x Friesians  were  20 kg heavier  than 
Friesians  at slaughter.  They had 2.2% units higher  kill-out  so their carcass  
weight  was 24 kg heavier  and muscle  weight  was 34 kg heavier.  Conformation  
was 0.4 units  better  for the MRY  crosses  than  Friesians  but fat score  was slightly

higher  (Table  14). Friesians  and MRY  crosses  had similar  bone  proportions  but 
the MRY  crosses  had about  1% units  less muscle  and 1% unit more  fat.
Overall,  MRY  crosses  were  slightly  more  productive  than  Friesians,  but they 
were  not any leaner.  Belgian  Blue  crosses  were  0.8 units  superior  in conforma ­
tion to Friesians  and had  0.3 units  lower  fat score.  They  also  had less bone,  more  
muscle,  less fat and a larger  muscle  size. In summary  therefore,  Belgian  Blue  
crosses  are vasUy  superior  to Friesians  in carcass  weight,  muscle  size, muscle  
percentage  and conformation.
Piedmontese  : The Piedmontese  breed  originated  in North  West  Italy. In 
terms  of muscling,  it is estimated  that about  60%  of the bulls  are double  muscled

and 40% are intermediate  in muscling.  Cows  are predominanUy  intermediate.  
The only country  in which  Piedmontese  is widely  used  seems  to be the Nether ­
lands  (Table  15). In 1975  less than l%ofNetherland  inseminations  was to beef 
bulls  and by 1985 it was less than 4%. In the following  years  to 1988 it trebled  
to over 12%. In 1975,  the main  beef  breed  was the Dutch  Red and White  with 
the Charolais  and  Limousin  making  up the rest. Ten  years  later  those  three  breeds  
had virtually  disappeared  and the Pi^montese  now accounted  for almost  70%  
of inseminations  with the Belgian  Blue  and Blonde  d'Aquitaine  being  the only 
other  breeds  of significance.  Thus  by Irish standards,  the Dutch  beef  breeds  are 
all minority  breeds.
The ranking  for various  traits of the progeny  from a number  of breeds  
including  the Piedmontese  relative  to the Charolais  is shown  in Table  16. The 
Piedmontese  had a growth  rate lower  than  any other  breed  except  the Limousin.  
However,  it had the highest  dressing  percentage  so its carcass  weight  ranking  
was above  the Limousin,  similar  to that  of the Blonde  d'Aquitaine  but below  that 
of the Charolais  and Belgian  Blue. In muscle  weight  it exceeded  everything  
except  the Belgian  blue. On the basis  of these  figures  therefore,  the Piedmontese  
is not exceptional  in growth  rate but has a high dressing  percentage  and good  
carcass  characteristics.  However,  there is nothing  to suggest  that its overall  
productivity  is better  than  the Charolais  or Belgian  Blue. From  the United  States  
a comparison  of the Piedmontese  and Gelbvieh  (similar  to the Simmental)  has 
been reported  (Table  17). The Gelbvieh  had a better  growth  rate but a poorer

However,  the Piedmontese  had less bone  and fat and more  muscle.  Both sets  of 
results  are in agreement  on the high dressing  percentage  and high muscle  
percentage  of the Piedmontese  but there is nothing  to suggest  that in overall  
productivity  it is clearly  superior  to all the other  common  continentals.
Ranking  of all breeds : Detailed  comparisons  of the main  breeds  have  been  
reported  recently  (Keane  and More O'Ferrall,  1987; More OFerrall,  1987;  
Keane,  1990). A summary  of the ranking  of all the breed  types  is contained  in 
Tables  18 and 19. Friesians,  Hereford  (British),  Limousin,  Blonde  d'Aquitaine  
and MRY  crosses  had similar  slaughter  weights  for age (Table  18). Canadian  
Hereford,  Simmental,  Charolais  and Belgian  Blue  crosses  had higher  slaughter  
weights  for age. All beef crosses  had higher  carcass  weights  for age than 
Friesians.  Hereford  (British),  Limousin  (Canadian),  Blonde  d'Aquitaine  and 
Belgian  Blue cross values  were higher,  and Simmental  and Charolais  cross  
values  were  highest  of all. In muscle  weight  for age,  the Hereford  crosses  did not 
retain  their relative  carcass  weight  superiority  over Friesians  whereas  all the

d'Aquitaine,  Charolais  and Belgian  Blue  crosses  had lower  fat score  (Table  19). 
All beef crosses  had better  conformation  than Friesians  and there was little  
difference  in conformation  between  the common  beef crosses.  MRY  crosses  
were intermediate  in conformation  between  Friesians  and the beef crosses.  
Longissimus  area is an indicator  of muscle  size and the breed  types  fell into two 
distinct  groups  for this  characteristic.  Friesians,  both  Hereford  crosses  and MRY  
crosses  had similar  and much larger longissimus  areas. Despite  the large  
differences  in conformation  there  was relatively  little  difference  between  breed  
types  in the proportion  of total muscle  in the higher  value  joints.
Conclusions
1. Using  a continental  rather  than  a haditional  breed  of bull increases  gestation  
length  by 2-4 days,  increases  calving  difficulty  incidence  by about  3% units  
and increases  calf mortality  by about  1 % unit.
2. Compared  with a traditional  breed  of bull a continental  bull increases  the 
interval  from  calving  to conception  and the number  of services  per concep ­
tion. This  together  with  the longer  gestation  increases  the calving  to calving  
interval  and milk  yield  is reduced  by 1-2%.  However,  the continental  cross  
calf is about  5 kg heavier  at birth.
3. High relative  growth  rate continental  bulls can be easy calving  and easy 
calving  continental  bulls  can have  high relative  growth  rates.
4. Canadian  Hereford  x Friesians  have  about  3% units  higher  live and carcass  
growth  rates than traditional  British  Hereford  x Friesians  but there  are no 
differences  between  the strains  in carcass  characteristics.
135
5. At the same  age,  Blonde  d'Aquitaine  x Friesians  produced  5% more  carcass  
weight  and 6% more  muscle  than Limousin  x Friesians.
6. Compared  with Friesians,  Belgian  Blue x Friesians  produced  3% more  
liveweight,  8% more  carcass  weight  and 18% more  muscle  weight.  They  
also had 2.3% units  better  kill-out  and 0.7 units  better  comformation.
7. The  Peidmontese  has a lower  growth  rate than  other  continentals  except  the 
Limousin.  However,  it has a very high dressing  percentage  and a high 
muscle  percentage.  Its overall  productivity  is not superior  to the common  
continentals.
8. Overall,  there  is little difference  in productivity  between  Friesians,  Here ­
ford (both strains)  x Friesians  and MRY  x Friesians  especially  if muscle  
weight  is included  and conformation  is excluded.  All continental  crosses  
are superior  to these.
9. Carcass  weights  of Friesians  and Friesian  crosses  at similar  carcass  fat 
proportions  are : Friesians  320, Herefords  (both strains)  290, MRY  320, 
Limousin  360, Simmental  380, Blonde  d'Aquitaine  4(X), Belgian  Blue  400 
and Charolais  400.

A Review  of The Grass  Growing  
Year 1989
P. DILLON  and G. STAKELUM  
Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
Efficient  production  and utilisation  of grass  were  never  so important  for dairy  
fanning  as at the present  With  the imposition  of milk  quotas  and more  recently  
^e falling  milk  price,  input  costs  must  be minimised.  Efficient  use of grassland  
is the key. In this paper  the grass  growing  season  of 1989  and the management  
factors  adopted  at Moorepark  to alleviate  the effect  of the mid-summer  drought  
are outlilned.  Results  are also reptorted  on two concentrate  supplementation  
trials  at pasture  with different  energy  and protein  sources.
Grass  growth  versus  cow requirement  
Figure  1 shows  thedverageseasonal  growth  pattern  of grassfor  1982-7,1988  
and 1989. Figures  2 and 3 show  seasonal  growth  patterns  for 1988 versus  the 
^owth  pattern  required  to supply  a given  level  of DM intake.  Cow  requirement  
is based  on a stocking  rate  of 0.85  acres/cow  with  45 and 35 percent  of the farm  
closed  for firstcutand  second  cut silage,  respectively,  with  high  level  of nitrogen  
usage and concentrates  taken out of the system  by late April. The intake  
requirement  is based  on a cow  of average  bodyweight  550  kg. a January  1 cal  ving 
date and an adjustment  for stage  of lactation  (ARC,  1980). In 1988 seasonal  
growth  pattern  was  greater  than cow requirement  until  the end of September.  In 
contrast  there  was a large  deficit  in cow requirement  during  late July and early  
August  in 1989. A feature  of 1989 was the poor growth  rate during  the April  
period  and the very good  grass  growth  in late August  and September.
Silage  yield  and quality
Table 1 shows  the silage  analyses  for the Dairymis  II Discussion  Group  in 
Fermoy  (28 farmers)  for both 1988 and 1989. The first cut silages  were on

average  of a higher  dry matter  content,  similar  preservation  and slightly  higher  
digestibility  for 1989  when  compared  to 1988. The second  cut silages  were  also 
of higher  diy matter  content,  with equally  good  preservation  and much  higher  
digestibility.  The third  cut silages  had smilar  analyses  of equally  good  quality.
Table  2 shows  the silage  yield  and  digestibilities  for Curtins  farm  at Moorepark.  
The notable  feature  is the very  poor  yield  of second  cut silage  and the very  large  
yield for the third  cut. This shows  the advantage  of taking  a third  cut of silage  
in a year with severe  drought  conditions  in mid-summer.  This  cut of silage  was 
also taken  without  having  a feed deficit  on the grazing  area (Figure  3).
Measures  taken  during  the drought  period
As we have seen in Figure  3 there  was a large  feed deficit  pteriod  in the late 
July-August  period.  Figure  4 shows  part  of a lactation  curve  for a herd  of cows

at Moorepark.  Daily  milk  yields  were  reduced  by almost  0.7 gals/cow  in the two 
weeks  at the onset  of the droughL  During  the following  four weeks  when  grass  
growth  was almost  at zero the cows  were  supplemented  with 5 kg. of hay plus 
20 kg. of wet brewers  grains.  In this period  it was  estimated  that the cows  were  
being supplemented  with 80% of their feed requirement.  The supplements  
maintained  milk yields  at 14.5 kg./cow/day.  It can be seen from Figure  4 that 
when  grass  growth  recovered  the milk yield of the cows  partially  recovered.
Supplementary  feeding  of grazing dairy  cows
Supplementation  of grazed  pasture  may be necessary  in early spring  after  
turn out due to poor  grass  growth,  in mid-summer  in the event  of a drought  and

from September  onwards  due to declining  growth  rates  of grass. "Hie type of 
supplement  fed can range from a forage,  i.e. a high quality  silage, to a 
concenu^te.  A concenu-ate  can be either  an energy  and/or  a protein  source.  Milk  
production  responses  to concentrate  feeding  have generally  been poor and 
uneconomical.  The major  reason  for the poor  responses  to concenOrate  feeding  
at pasture  is the substitution  of concentrate  for grazed  grass. This is defined  as 
the decrease  in grass intake  per unit of concentrate  fed. The most important  
factors  that  affect  substitution  rate  are grass  intake  and digestibility.  When  intake  
or digestibility  of grass  is high substitution  rate is also high. Many  other  factors  
affect  substitution  rate, such as concentrate  type, lactation  stage,  cow genetic  
merit  and level  of concentrate  feeding.  Experiments  at Moorepark  from 1976-

1987 under  a wide range of grazing  pressures,  types of concentrates  and at 
different  times  of the grazing  season  gave  an average  response  of 0.50  kg. milk/  
kg. of concentrate.  Table  3 shows  the milk/concentrate  price  ratio from 1982- 
1989, taking  the average  milk and concentrate  prices  from the Dairymis  II 
Discussion  Group  in Fermoy.  Over that period  the price of milk increased  
relative  to the cost of concentrate.  Therefore  the break-even  milk production  
response  in 1989  was  0.68  kg. milk/kg.  of  concentrate  fed when  concentrate  costs  
£ 140/tonne and  milk was priced  at 22p/kg.
Two  experiments  were  carried  out in Moorepark  during  the grazing  season  in 
1989 with different  energy  and protein  sources  as supplements  to grazing  dairy  
cows.

Experiment  A
High quality  fibrous  concentrates  have been reported  to give higher  milk  
production  responses  and lower  substitution  rates  compared  to starchy  concen ­
trates  when  fed to grazing  dairy  cows  (Meijs,  1985).  Very  large  substitution  rates  
with barley  compared  to both molassed  beet  pulp or beet  pulp nuts were  found  
with  grazing  dairy  cows  (Stakelum  and Dillon  1988).  The  large  substitution  rate 
was associated  with reduced  pH and increased  lactate  concentration  in rumen  
fluid  shortly  after  feeding  (Dillon,  Stakelum  and Murphy,  1989).
Four  groups  of 22 cows  were  assigned  to four  treatments,  i.e. grass  only,  grass  
plus barley,  grass  plus molassed  beet pulp and grass  plus brewers  grains. The 
experiment  was conducted  for 13 weeks  from late July until late October.  The 
supplements  were fed immediately  after morning  milking. The barley  ^d 
molassed  beet  pulp  were  fed at4 kg. /cow/day  for the first4  weeks  in conjunction

with 4 kg. of hay supplement.  Thereafer,  as grass growth  returned  to normal  
following  the end of the drought,  the cows  were  fed 5 kg./cow/day  with no hay 
supplement  The  brewers  grains  were  fed at 15 kg./cow/day  for the first  4 weeks  
and thereafter  at 20 kg./cow/day . The  chemical  composition  of the supplements  
are given  in Table  4. Table  5 shows  the milk  yield,  milk  composition  and milk  
yield  response  to the different  supplements.  All three  supplements  significantly  
increased  milk yield over the control.  The molassed  beet pulp and brewers  
grains  gave significantly  higher  milk yield than the barley  supplement.  Fat 
content  was significantly  decreased  in the brewers  grains  and barley  groups  
compared  with the grass only treatment.  Protein  content  was significanUy  
increased  for the barley  and molassed  beet pulp compared  with the grass  only 
treatment.  Figure  5 outlines  the milk production  pattern  of the four treatment  
groups.  There  appeared  to be no difference  in milk yield  during  the first four 
weeks  when the  hay supplement  was fed. During  the later  part  of the experiment  
after  grass  growth  rate resumed  the differences  between  the groups  manifested  
themselves.  The experiment  supports  previous  work that higher  milk yield  
responses  are obtained  with high quality  fibrous  concentrates  compart  to 
starchy  concentrates  when  fed at pasture.
Experiment  B
The  crude  protein  fraction  of grazed  herbage  is a complex  mixture  of  proteins,  
peptides,  amino  acids  and non-protein  nitrogen.  When  herbageenters  the rumen,  
the rumen  microflora  ferment  the soluble  and structural  carbohydrates  to yield  
a mixture  of volatile  fatty  acids. In so doing  they  also  digest  the protein  fraction  
in the herbage  with the release  of ammonia.  Subsequently  the microflora

synthesise  their  own protein  and utilise  the ammonia  as a nitrogen  source.  The 
net result  is that  a major  portion  of the protein  passing  out of the rumen  and into 
the small intestines  is of microbial  origin. Microbial  protein  is of average  
biological  value, i.e. it could be deficient  in certain  essential  amino  acids.  
Therefore  when higher  quality  unprotected  protein  is fed (high in biological  
value) it can be transformed  into low quality  by breakdown  in the rumen.  There  
is evidence  in the literature  that there  is a positive  response  in milk  production  
to feeding  protected  protein  at pasture  (Minson,  1981).
Figure  6 outlines  the crude  protein  content  of herbage  across  a full grazing  
season.  More  recent  results  at Moorepark  show  that the actual  herbage  selected  
by the grazing  cow is of a still higher  crude  protein  content.  Experiments  at 
Moorepark  indicate  that of the total herbage  crude  protein  ingested,  75% is 
rapidly  degraded  in the rumen  (RDP)  and 25%  is resistant  to further  breakdown  
and passes  onto the small  intestines  as undegraded  protein  (UDP)  (Stakelum,  
Dillon  and Murphy,  1988;  Dillon  et al., 1989). An experiment  was conducted  
in Curtins  farm at Moorepark  to evaluate  milk  production  responses  to different  
protein  supplements  compared  to an energy  source.  Four  groups  of 18 cows  were  
assigned  to four treatments,  i.e. a grass  only  group,  grass  plus 3.2 kg. of barley.

grass plus 3 kg. of soyabean  meal and grass plus 3 kg. of sopralin. The 
experiment  lasted  nine weeks  from early  September  until late November  when  
cows were late in lactation.  The supplements  were fed immediately  after the 
morning  milking.  The chemical  composition  of the feeds  is given  in Table  7. 
Table  8 shows  the milk  yield, milk  composition  and milk yield  responses  to the 
different  supplements.  The sopralin  supplement  significantly  increased  milk 
yield and decreased  fat content  over the grass  only treatment.  The barley  and 
soya supplements  significantly  increased  protein  content.  It is not possible  to 
explain  whether  the much  larger  positive  response  to the sopralin  was due to 
more amino  acids reaching  the small intestines  or a dietary  energy  response.  
However,  the response  to sopralin  is not an economic  one due to the high  price  
of the concentrate.  The much  lower  response  to the barley  in this experiment  
compared  to Experiment  A was due to a higher  supply  of grass.
Conclusion
With falling  milk prices and fixed quotas  it is imperative  that grassland  
management  be excellent  and that concentrate  feeding  on grass is eliminated
11
where  adequate  grass is available.  However,  there can be periods  during  the 
grazing  season  when  cows might  be short  of feed (i.e. drought  of 1989)  and a 
supplement  would  then  need  to be fed. There  is clear  evidence  that  a fibrous  type 
concentrate  gives  much  better  milk yield responses  than a starchy  concentrate  
when fed as a supplement  to grazing  dairy cows. In the future,  however,  
conserving  extra  silage  in order  to use it as a supplemnt  during  periods  of grass  
shortage  may  be more  economical.  The  surpluses  which  arise  during  the grazing  
season  could  be conserved  as silage  by the use of a flexible  management  system  
based on tight grazing  to 6 cm in order to maximise  quality  of grass under  
grazing.  At present  it is not possible  to define  under  what circumstances  an 
economical  response  may be got from feeding  undegradable  protein.  Where  
adequate  grass  was available,  very  poor  responses  were  obtained  from feeding  
degradable  protein.

Breeding  Policies  for the ’90's
PROF.  E. P. CUNNINGHAM,

The American  economist  Francis  Fukuyama,  viewing  the collapse  of com­
munism  in Eastern  Europe,  recently  announced  "This  is the end of history".  He 
exaggerates  of course,  but looking  at the current  and impending  changes  on the 
cattle  breeding  scene  here  in Ireland,  and indeed  throughout  Europe,  one  can feel 
a similar  sense  that  an old order  is passing  and that  the future  will  be very  different  
from  what  we have been used to.
♦ The decades  of growth  in output  fuelled  by expanding  population,  rising  
living  standards  and the sustaining  hand  of Brussels,  have  come  to an end. 
In those  days,  the good,  the mediocre  and the bad could  all survive.  For the 
future,  the uncompetitive  will face declining  fortunes.  That applies  to 
breeds,  breeding  programmes  and breeders,  as well as to farmers  and 
farming  systems.
♦ Governments  everywhere  are getting  out of the breeding  business,  and 
nowhere  faster  than in Ireland.
♦ In  its drive  to "complete  the internal  market"  by 1992,  the EEC  has ordained  
a deregulation  of the AI industry.  That  industry  in Ireland,  as elsewhere,  has 
developed  as a protected  monopoly; in future  it will have  to fight  for its share  
of the market.
♦ The quota  regime  changes  dairy  farmers'  breeding  objectives;  for some  it 
intensifies  the drive to more specialised  dairy types,  while for others  it 
signals  a return  to dual purpose  aims.
♦ The search  for new breeds  is finished;  we have Died all the likely beef 
breeds,  and the Holstein  is the third and last foreign  wave  of dairy  genetic  
material  to hit our shores.
♦ Two elements  of semen and embryo  technology,  at present  showing  
promise  in the laboratory,  have the potential  to change  the cattle  breeding  
scene  beyond  anything  we would  recognise.
The purpose  of this paper  is to discuss  our options  in the light  of these  develop ­
ments.
AI
Al is the principal  medium  for genetic  improvement  in our cattle. Not alone  
are more  than half the cows  bred by AI, but most  of the remainder  are bred by 
sons  of AI bulls. Furthermore,  it is the sector  in which  policy  decisions  can have  
a big impact;  several  bulls here bred over 30,000  progeny  each last year.
The percent  of cows  bred  by Al in Ireland  is rather  low by European  standards  
(Table  1). Our figure  is 51%, the lowest  in northern  Europe.  Elsewhere,  with 
the exception  of Britain  and France,  the norm is 90% or higher.

Part of the reason  for the low AI usage  in Britain  and France  is the high 
proportion  of beef  cows  in those  countries.  For obvious  reasons,  AI is both  less 
convenient  and less obviously  valuable  in suckler  herds. In France,  while  AI 
usage  is 80%  in dairy  herds,  it is only 20%  in suckler  herds.  Perhaps  this is the 
reason  for  the low  penetration  rate  here,  though  curiously,  a survey  of600  suckler  
herds  in 1985 by G. J. More  O’Ferrall  and colleagues  showed  a 60% AI usage  
level. At any rate, there seems  to be no good reason  why we should  be so 
significantly  behind  the rest  of northern  Europe  in AI usage  levels,  and  one  of the 
expectations  for the future  should  be an increase  in its use.
The structure  of the AI business  in Ireland  has remained  essentially  un­
changed  for over 30 years,  with two exceptions:  Ballyhaise  gave  up their  bull 
stud, and the five Munster  centres  set up a joint bull acquisition  and testing  
programme.  We can expect  substantial  changes  in the near future. Elsewhere  
in Europe,  AI organisations  are amalgamating  and consolidating  to face the 
competition  which  will  come  with  the EEC  deregulation  of 1992.  The  legislation  
for this is already  in place,  and its intention  is to promote  free trade  in semen  and 
embryos  within  the Community.  Health  regulations,  which  have isolated  us 
from  Continnetal  imports  in the past,  will no longer  be a problem.  Among  other  
things,  the Commission  proposes  to eliminate  Foot and Mouth  vaccination  
throughout  the Community.
Indeed,  this competition  is already  here  in a substantial  way;  this year  at least  
100,000  units  of semen  will be imported.  This is almost  all high performance  
Holstein  semen,  coming  from  Holland,  Denmark,  France,  New  Zealand,  Canada  
and the US. We will pay out at least  £1.5m.  for it. While  that is only sufficient  
to breed  a quarter  of our AI bred Friesian  cows,  it is, in financial  terms,  much  
more  significant.  All of the semen  produced  by the Irish  AI organisations  has a 
production  cost  of less than  £1 a straw,  and we could  therefore  say that  the money  
spent  on imported  semen  this year  will be greater  than the revenue  to our own  AI 
system  for all of the semen  it produces.  Another  way of putting  it is that the 
import  cost of this Holstein  semen  is about  three  times  what  we are currently  
spending  on improving  our own Friesians.
14
Our domestic  AI industry  is therefore  under  threat.  The challenge  is not so 
much  on the technical  side. The  efficiency  of the "arm  service"  seems  to be good,  
to judge  from published  non-retum  rates. The pressure  will come  more  on the 
quality  of the genetic  material  on offer  and on operational  costs.
While  half  of Irish AI is with beef  breed  semen,  the battle  for survival  will 
largely  be fought  out on dairy  merit There  are a couple  of reasons  for this. The 
first  is that the customer  has a choice  of about  10 beef  breeds,  so that most  of his 
requirements  are met by having  reasonable  bulls of these breeds  available.  
Secondly , performance  and  progeny  testing  for beef,  and  calving  surveys,  are not 
so expensive  as dairy  testing,  so that most  AI centres  can provide  at least  some  
documented  merit  in individual  bulls  within  each  breed.  Thirdly,  because  of the 
wide  variety  of beef  production  systems,  the internationally  trading  AI organ ­
isations  have  not found  it worthwhile  to make  large investments  in generating  
outstanding  genetic  merit  in the beef  breeds.
The Dairy  Breeding  Programme
In Ireland,  as everywhere  else, we have a fairly well defined  system  of 
progeny  testing  and selection  of dairy  bulls. Currently,  we are testing  36 bulls  
per year,  and selecting  about  1 in 4 after  the progeny  test is complete.  Along  the 
way,  these  bulls  are now mostly  reared  either  in Bandon  or in Sligo,  so that some  
comparative  growth  and feed efficiency  information  is available  on them,  and 
most  of them  also  have  beef  progeny  tests  based  on 20 steers  reared  to slaughter.  
The whole  exercise  is a fairly  costly  one. The question  is how cost  effective  it 
is, and how competitive  it is likely  to be in future.
The formal  selection  goal  in most  European  dairy  and dual purpose  AI cattle  
selection  programmes  normally  includes  about  12 separate  traits. These  cover  
milk production  (milk,  fat and protein),  beef  production  (growth,  fatness  and 
conformation),  calving  ease  and mortality,  and linear  type  traits  indicating  dairy  
utility. This is the list currently  used in Ireland.  In other  countries,  additional  
information  is provided  on milking  speed,  temperament,  fertility  and health  
(mastitis  and ketosis). In all cases, including  Ireland,  ultimate  selection  is 
effectively  exercised  on a milk  production  index,  which generally  combines  fat 
and protein  yields  with a higher  weighting  on protein
These  selection  objectives  are not likely  to change  seriously  in the future.  If 
anything  the concentration  on milk  production  traits  will increase.  In particular,  
two developments  are likely  to reinforce  this. The first  is that as production  per 
cow increases  and as dairy farming  becomes  more specialised,  the breeder's  
interest  becomes  more  narrowly  focused  on dairy  production.  The  second  is that 
the higher  the level of beef  crossing  in the dairy  herd,  the more  the dairy  farmer  
can concentrate  his attention  on dairy traits in the sires he uses to breed  his 
replacement  heifers.  If and when  sexed  semen becomes  available,  this speciali ­
sation  will be carried  to the ultimate  extent.
Cost benefit  studies
I have conducted  a number  of cost benefit  studies  on AI related  breeding  
programmes  over the years and most recently  one for the Munster  Cattle
15
Breeding  Society. The first stage of such a study is to define  the breeding  
objective.  I concentrated  on three  milk  production  traits  (milk  yield,  fat yield  and 
protein  yield)  and two beef  traits  (growth  rate  and  carcass  conformation).  These  
determine  most  of the selection  decisions  that are made.
Milk  volume  has a negative  value. Most  of this is a transport  charge  of about  
Ip/kg. Adding  on farm refrigeration  costs,  and making  some allowance  for 
inplant  costs,  we have taken  a negative  value  of -1.25p/kg  of milk volume.
Fat and protein  are valued  in relation  to world  prices. Both butter  and skim  
milk powder  had prices  last autumn  of about  £1,3(X)  per tonne. For SMP,  this 
is not far off the intervention  price,  while  for butter  the intervention  price  is twice  
the world  price.  Translating  the world  prices  back  to values  for milk  protein  and 
butterfat  gives  values  of £1.61/kg  of butterfat  and £3.50/kg  protein.
To arrive  at net values  for these,  we have subtracted  the marginal  feed cost 
required.  Assuming  the feed input  consists  of grazed  grass (64%),  conserved  
grass  (26%)  and concentrates  (10%),  and that these  have  relative  costs  per unit 
of metabolisable  energy  (MJME)  of 1: 2 : 3, we can calculate  the average  cost 
of a unit of feed energy.  This works  out at 0.75p  per MJME.  A kilogram  of 
butterfat  requires  about  69 MJME  of feed input,  while  a kilogram  of protein  
requires  about  36 MJME.  Feed  costs  are therefore  52p and 27p respectively.
For growth  rate, we took  a gross  value  of 250p/kg  of carcass,  and subtracted  
the cost  of the 200 MJME  of energy  required  to produce  that. Improvements  in 
carcass  conformation  require  no additional  energy  but are quite  complicated  to 
calculate,  because  of the price  differential  on conformation  varies  over  years  and 
by type  and weight  of animal.  Taking  five years'  data,  we arrived  at a value  of 
aboutt  5p/kg.  for one grade  change.  On a 330 kg.  animal  this is worth  £16.50.  
These  economic  values  are summarised  in Table  2.

High  value  of protein
The net values  we have  airived  at are substantially  different  from  those  that 
have been used in the breeding  programme  in recent  years. In particular,  they 
gave  protein  nearly  three  times  the weighting  per  kilogram  of butterfat,  while  the 
present  RB182 weightings  give  protein  1.4 times  the weighting  of butterfat  The 
RB182 values  are very  much  in line  with  those  of  progressive  European  breeding  
schemes  in recent  years. However,  it is notable  that late last year  Ixith the Dutch  
and the French  have  revised  their  weightings,  in both  cases  to give  several  times  
the value  to protein  that they give to fat

In carrying  out these  calculations,  we used  the discounted  gene  flow  method  
and the computer  programme  SELIND,  both  of which  were  developed  here  and 
which  are quite  widely  used for these  purposes  elsewhere.
Relative  gains  from different  programmes
The present  Irish  programme  aims  to acquire  about  80 young  bulls  each  year,  
to progeny  test 40 and to select  10. Three  variants  of the present  (8040-10)  
programme  have  been  investigated.  The  first  is a simple  doubling  of the number  
of bulls  tested  at each  stage,  with the number  finally  calculated  held  constant  at 
five. This is represented  at (160-80-10).  Performance  testing  is cheaper  than 
progeny  testing,  so we have  looked  at doubling  this element  along  (16040-10).  
Finally,  since  the performance  test, while  inexpensive,  does  not contribute  a lot 
to ultimate  gain,  we have  looked  at kc->:ping  it constant  and doubling  the progeny  
testing  stage  (80-80-10).
The returns  in each case  will depend  on whether  a farmer  retains  his surplus  
calves  or sells  them  (in which  case  he is presumed  to keep  a quarter  of the genetic  
merit  for beef  traits).  It is also  of interest  to compare  the eff^ect  of the milk  quota  
regime.  We have  assumed  that the quota  reduces  the value  of improvement  in 
dairy  traits  by three  quarters.  The results  in each case are therefore  presented  
with and without  quota,  and with  calves  sold and reared.  The results  are given  
in Table  3.

■Tie most  relevant  case is with quota,  calves  sold,  present.programme.  This 
shows  a genetic  added  value  per AI of £32. This is clearly  very good value  to 
the user. Assuming  that the AI costs  £14,  and that about  £10 of this would  have  
been required  to get a cow in calf, the genetic  benefit  from  AI is worth  close  to 
£30.

♦ The quota  regime  reduces  the benefits  by an average  of about  £9 (range  £7-
£10) from the prequota  system.  'y
♦ A farmer  who rears  his calves  gains  on average  an additional  £3 from the 
genetic  merit  provided  (range  £2 - £4).
♦ Doubling  the scale  of the programme  adds  about  £9 of benefit  per AI (£11.00  
before  quotas).
♦ Doubling  the performance  test  adds  about  £3. Doubling  the progeny  test  adds  
about  £6.
International  comparisons
A couple  of years  ago, I published  a comparison  of 30 breeding  programmes  
in Europe,  the US  A and  New  Zealand.  I reduced  the comparison  to two structural  
statistics:  the number  of bulls tested  i)er million  AI and the lifetime  usage  of 
selected  bulls. The results  are shown  in Figure  1. Briefly,  this shows  that the 
European  programmes  are testing  large  numbers  of bulls  but making  relatively  
little use of the selected  ones, while the American  programmes  tested  much  
fewer  bulls  but used them  more  extensively.  This difference  in strategy  can be 
easily  rationalised.  In Europe,  each AI organisation  has served  a fairly  small  
market  on monopoly  basis.  In America,  they  all have  access  to huge  markets  and 
must  comjjete  with  each  other. The New  Zealand  Jersey  and Friesian  program ­
mes were  outstanding  mainly  because  of their  huge  usage  levels.  The Irish and 
British  programmes  were  micing  the lowest  investments  in bull testin  tr of all the 
European  schemes.

I did the calculations  again last year, and was surprised  at how little had 
changed.  In most European  programmes  they are still testing  four times  the 
number  of bulls  that we lest per million  inseminations.  The  one major  improve ­
ment  here has been the success  of the fresh semen  programme  in the Munster  
group,  which  has pushed  bull usage  levels  for the best  selected  bulls  well  beyond  
what  most  European  organisations  can achieve.
Since  most  AI organisations  are now selecting  for the same  objectives,  with 
the same  basic stock,  differences  in level  of investment  will largely  determine  
competitive  ability. I calculate  that our current  Friesian  testing  and selection  
programme  is costing  about  half a million  pounds,  or about  £ 1.50/Friesian  AI. 
This represents  about  10% of the AI fee. In Denmark  they claim  the breeding  
programme  cost 22.6%  of the AI fee, in the Netherlands  38.8%,  and in France  
at least 39%.
Holsteins
In 1973, I reviewed  such evidence  as then existed  on the performance  of 
American  and Canadian  Holsteins  and their  crosses  in European  countries.  The 
data available  were not the best a mixture  of small scale, well-controlled  
experiments  and larger  scale analyses  of field data. However,  a consistent  
picture  emerged  from the twelve  reports  I was able to assemble  from several  
countries.  This was that the US strain  appteared  to be about  5% higher  in milk 
production  than the Canadian,  and more than 20% higher  than the European.  
There  was less information  on the beef side, and what there  was indicated  no 
penalties  on growth  rate  but some  or. carcass  merit.  These  results  were  presented  
at a meeting  of this Association  in 1974.
In the same  year,  with  encouragement  from  the editor  of the Farmers'  Journal,  
Waterford  Co-op  decided  to finance  an experimental  importation.  The original  
idea was to import  from the US, and in preparation  for this we did an interesting  
computer  search  of over half a million  cows  in the north-eastern  United  States  
to preselect  heifers  for import. We emphasised  milk production,  but also the 
improvement  of butterfat  percentage  and the avoidance  of the extremely  large  
framed  and angular  models  of the Holstein.  In the event,  because  of blue  tongue  
disease,  the focus  was shifted  to Canada  and 30 pedigree  Holstein  heifers  were  
selected  in Ontario  in September  1974 for importation.  Two of them survived  
the various  quarantine  stages  and calved  down in Coolnakilla  in 1975. A 
matching  group  of 25 pedigree  Irish Fnesians  was selected  and a further  group  
of comparable  commercial  Friesian  heifers  was  assembled,  partly  from  Moorepark  
replacement  heifers. The three groups  were run together  during 1975 at 
Coolnakilla  and in the subsequent  three years at Waterford  Co-op's  farm at 
Castlelyons.
The trial was far  from  perfect,  mainly  because  of the very different  treatment  
of the Holsteins  in the rearing  and pre-calving  period. However,  the results  
confirmed  our expectations.  The pedigree  and commercial  groups  were very 
similar,  while  the Holstein  group  gave  7%, 13%,  25% and 36% higher  yields  in 
their first four lactations.  Though  fat percenuge  was consistendy  lower,  fat 
yields  were  3%, 10%, 14% and 24%  higher.  The Holsteins  were  slighdy  faster

years  has been Holstein  and the Holstein  content  of the Approved  Bull list is 
about  25% and climbing  year by year. Everywhere  else in Europe,  they have  
essentially  taken  over  at this stage.  There  is vehement  opposition  from  those  who 
have to rear the bull calves  but the realities  are, first, that they are generally  
different  people  from those  who make  the breeding  decisions,  and second,  that 
because  of the high level  of beef  crossing,  the Friesian  and Holstien  bull calves  
make  up only  25% of all our beef  animals  (Table  4). The movement  to Holstein  
is simply  part  of the drive  for higher  biological  efficiency  and  higher  profitability  
in milk produciton  (see Figure  2).
New  technology
AI arrived  on the scene  40 years  ago and has transformed  cattle  breeding  here 
and in other  developed  countries.  Embryo  technology  was perfected  about  10 
years ago and it has also had major  effects,  though  in a more  restricted  area. 
About  75% of all young  bulls  recruited  for AI are now being  produced  by ET.
The new techniques  now  being  developed  include  sexing  of semen,  sexing  of 
embryos,  mass  production  of embryos  by IVF  (in vitro  fertilisation),  and finally,  
cloning  of embryos.  In Figure  3,1 have  attempted  to put  these  in persp^tive.  The 
real question  is not whether  they are feasible,  but whether  they  are likely  to be 
competitive  with the existing  AI technology.

Sexed  semen  would  clearly  be a major  benefit.  It would  put an end,  once  and 
for all, to the dual-purpose  argument.  Specialised  replacement  heifers  would  be 
Holstein  or the equivalent,  and  all other  calves  would  be beef  cross  and  male.  IVF 
embryos  have b^n around  for a year or two, but there  is difficulty  achieving  
acceptable  success  rates  at reasonable  cost. Pre-sexing  of these  is now  becoming

feasible  and that will certianly  add io their value,  though  whether  it will be 
sufficient  to make  them competitive  with AI is doubtful.  For the specialised  
purposes  now served  by conventional  embryo  production,  pre-sexing  wiU un­
doubtedly  be worth  the extra  effort.
Cloning  of embryos  (i.e. sub-division  of embryos  to make  many  identical  
copies  of the individual)  has now been achieved  on an experiemental  scale. If 
costs  can be reduced  and field  success  rates  increase,  it will undoubtedly  replace  
a lot of the conventional  AI business.  A version  of cloning,  called  Stem-Cell  
Multiplicadon,  offers  the  prospect  of achieving  this,  at least  in theory.  When  this 
technology  matures,  it will give us the possibility  of implanting  a very specific  
genotype  into each cow. I am confident  that at that stage  we will be looking  
beyond  highly  selected  pure-bred  genotypes  to take advantage  of some  of the 
benefits  in viability,  performance  and longevity  which  hybrid  animals  undoubt ­
edly possess.

Crossbreeding  in the Dairy  Herd  - 
Coping  with Calving  Problems
J. F. MEE
Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
The  increased  use of specialised  beef  breeds  as terminal  sires  in the dairy  herd 
has accentuated  farmers'  awareness  of the variation  in calving  problems  both 
between  and within  beef breeds. However,  the fear of increased  calving  
problems  is still the primary  deterrent  to more  widespread  usage  of continental  
beef breeds  in the national  dairy herd. Traditionally,  the Hereford  was the 
dominant  beef breed  and remained  so until the 1980's  when a swing  to the 
continental  breeds  took place  (Fig. 1).
The effects  of beef crossbreeding  in the dairy heard on production  and 
reproduction  have  recently  been  reviewed  by More  O'Ferrall  and Ryan  (1988,  
1990). It was concluded  that sire breed had no significant  effect  on mean  
lactation  milk,  fat or protein  yield  or lactation  length,  in thecurrent  or subsequent  
lactation.  The calving  to conception  interval  was significantly  longer  for Sim- 
mental  sired  calves  compared  with Charolais  and Hereford  sired  calves  which  
was in turn significantly  longer  than that  of Friesian  calves.  The  calving  interval  
of Simmental  and Limousin  sired calves  was significantly  longer  than that of 
Charolais  and Hereford  sired  calves  which  was  in turn  longer  than  that  of  Friesian  
calves  (More  O'Ferrall,  1987).
The objective  of this paper  is to outline  the nature  and extent  of the calving  
problems  associated  with beef crossing  in the dairy herd and to examine  how 
these  problems  may be ameliorated  by good  management.

Calving  problems
Recent  calving  surveys  and crossbreeding  trials  in Ireland  and the UK have  
quantified  the current  differences  between  breeds  and between  sires within  
breeds  (More  O’Ferrall,  1987; Anon.,  1988/89;  Anon.,  1990; Mee & Dings,  
1990).  In general  calving  difficulty,  gestation  length  and calf  mortality  increase  
as breed  size increases  except  for die Limousin  and Blonde  D'Aquitaine  breeds  
which  tend to have  a longer  gestation  length  than expected  from the sire breed  
size. Although  the continental  breeds  generally  have a higher  rate of calving  
difficulty  than traditional  breeds,  (approximatley  two to three  times  greater),  it 
is now  possible  to choose  sires with lower  calving  difficulty  figures  than those  
of Hereford  sires  even  though  the continental  sire  breed  average  has not  changed  
over the years.
The primary  calving  problems  associated  with crossbreeding  are those  
related  to increased  calf birth weight,  i.e. calving  difficulty,  calf mortality  and 
prolonged  gestation.  Calving  difficulty  is mainly  associated  with  relative  foetal  
oversize  and malpresentations  but also with poor maternal  preparation  for 
calving  and environmental  factors  (Table  1). Relative  foetal  oversize  due to 
crossbreeding  is inherently  determined  by hereditary  factors  such as breed,  sire,  
sex and gestation  length but is also modulated  by environmental  factors  such  as 
precalving  nutrition,  parity  and season. Continental  crossbred  calves  have a 
significantly  higher  prenatd  growth  rate than traditional  British  beef  breeds  but 
their birth weight  has a relatively  low correlation  with posmatal  growth  rate.

The  consequence  of this elevated  birth  weight  is a higher  rate  of both assisted  
and  difficult  covings  (Tables  2,3).  While  the perinatal  mortality  rate  is generally  
also higher  for continental  sires  there  is large  variation  within  each  breed  (Table  
4). Prolonged  gestation  can be a serious  problem  with  certain  sires  causing  foetal  
oversize  and prolonging  the calving  interval.

Coping  with calving  problems.
1. Choice  of sire
In choosing  which  breed  and which  sire to crossbreed  a percentage  of the 
dairy  herd with,  calving  problems  must  rank as important  selection  criteria.  To 
aid selection  of sires  from A.I. centres  the Department  of Agriculture  and Food  
produce,  each spring,  a list of beef  sires with below  average  calvkig  difficulty  
rates (Anon.,  1990). When  comparing  breeds  a difference  in serious  calving  
difficulty  rate of 1.5% or greater  indicates  a significant  difference  between  
breeds,  while a difference  of 3.0% or greater  is required  for a significant  
difference  between  sires within a breed. Studies  conducted  at Moorepark

When  purchasing  a natural  service  sire one is dependent  upon  the grandsire's  
performance  and the appearance  of the bull before  an assessment  can be made  
on the herd. In order  to avoid  serious  problems  in the first year it is generally  
recommended  that unproven  sires  be used  selectively  on only a few older,  easy  
calving  cows  (Herron,  1989). Heifers,  second  calvers,  smaller  cows  and cows  
with a history  of calving  problems  should  not be crossbred  unless  the calving  
results  of the sire are below  the breed  average.  With  both  A.I.  and  natural  service  
sires it is essential  to keep  a record  of service  dates  as such data  may be needed  
if prolonged  gestation  is suspected  and induction  contemplated.
2. Precalving feeding.
Once a beef sire has been selected  prevention  of calving  problems  is now 
dependent  upon the  management  of the cow  during  pregnancy  and calving.  The 
effect  of precalving  nutrition  on calf  birth weight  and on calving  difficulty  has 
often  been  emphasized  in preventing  foetal  oversize.  Results  from  experiments  
in both dairy  and beef  cows suggest  only a minor  effect  of precalving  feeding  
level on calving  performance  (Drennan,  1979; Sejrsen  & Neimann-Sorensen,  
1979).  Two  thirds  of foetal  growth  occurs  during  the last trimester  of pregnancy  
while  at term the rate of prenatal  average  daily  gain slows  down  to 200-500  ^ 
day. Results  from  Teagasc  studies  on beef  cows  have  shown  that  unless  the cow 
actually  loses  body  condition  during  the latter  stages  of pregnancy  the foetus  will 
exercise  preference  for nutrients  and grow at the expense  of the cow. While  
problems  of obesity  at calving  may occur  with heifers  the problem  with cows

28
currently  is more  often  one of poor  body  condition  at calving  as 'steaming  up' 
precalving  is not widely  practised  due ot milk quota  restrictions.  Achieving  
optimum  body condition  score  at calving  (Table  6) may necessitate  restricting  
heifer's  silage  intake  and providing  supplementary  concentrate  feed for thin 
cows.
3. Calving  induction
At term problems  with cows  'going  overtime'  may be obviated  by inducing  
calving  at, or  preterm.  The commercial  regimes  currently  available  suffer  from 
a high incidence  of side effects  such as poor  udder  distension,  poor  preparation  
for calving,  retained  placentae,  and stillbirths.  An alternative  regime  developed  
at Belclare  Research  Centre  has shown  promising  results  in trials but is not 
commercially  available  (Diskin,  McEvoy  & Sreenan,  1989). Ideally  induction  
of calving  should  be practised  on a planned  basis  with  known  service  dates  and 
initiation  of the regime  some  14 days  before  the predicted  calving  date in order  
to achieve  a substantial  reduction  in birth  weight  Problem  with  prematurity  will 
arise if induction  is practised  more than one month  preterm  (O'Farrell  & 
Crowley,  1974). It should  be noted  that while  prolonged  gestation  may occur  
with individual  matings  within  all breeds  it is not a feature  of the traditional  
British  beef  breeds  nor of the Belgian  Blue or MRi breeds  (Table  7).

4. Calving  supervision
At calving  time it is recommended  that all calvings  be supervised,  but not 
necessarily  assisted,  irrespective  of the breed  of sire selected.  Being  present  at 
each  calving  enables  one to monitor  the course  of the normal calving,  correct  an 
abnormal  calving,  revive  a weak  calf,  disinfect  the navel  cord  and  feed  colostrum  
promptly.  Recently,  calving  aids have  been introduced  to make  more  efficient  
use of labour  during  the calving  season  both during  the day and at night  (Mee,  
1988). Studies  at Moorepark  have shown  no advantage  of premature  interven ­
tion during  the calving  process  and in fact this leads to increased  usage  of the 
calving  jack  and more  weak  calves  after  calving.  It is suggested  that heifers  be 
left to calve  undistrubed  for approximatley  2 to 3 hours  and cows  for approxi ­
matley  2 hours before  intervention  is contemplated.  Implementation  of this 
policy  at Moorepark  has reduced  the incidence  of unnecessary  interference
29
during  normal  calving.  While  comparable  studies  have  not  been  conducted  with 
crossbred  calvings  it is suggested  that  a similar  approach  to cal  ving  would  reduce  
the incidence  of calving  difficulty.
5. Caesarean  section
The question  of whether  or when  to perform  a caesarean  section  at a difficult  
calving  is one that needs  to be addressed  by the attending  veterinary  surgeon  
based  on the individual  circumstances  of the calving,  and in some  cases  the breed  
of sire. While  double  muscling  will not occur  in crossbred  calves  it presents  a 
problem  with embryo-transfer  calves  and this needs to be borne in mind if 
attempting  vaginal  delivery  by forced  extraction.  The caesarean  section  rate of 
double  muscled  breeds,  when  crossbred,  is similar  to that of other  beef  breeds.  
Current  studies  at Moorepark  are attempting  to predict  the degree  of calving  
difficulty  based  on the relationship  between  the size  of the calf  s legs  and  its body  
weight.  It is hoped  that  this index  may  be used  when  deciding  whether  to perform  
surgery  or deliver  the calf  per vaginum.
6. Calf  resuscitation
Even before  the calf is bom stimulation  of breathing  is often necessary  in 
cases of abnormal,  prolonged  or difficult  calvings.  Amniotic  fluid can be 
evacuated  manually  or using suction  devices  during  calving  (Mee,  1988).  Once  
the calf is bom,  brief  suspension  will drain  excess  fluid and establish  a patent  
airway. Stimulation  and maintenance  of a regular  respiratory  rhythm  may be 
effected  by the traditional  means  of prodding  a finger  into the calfs nostrils,  
throwing  cold water  over the calfs  head  or ventilating  the chest  by raising  ^d 
lowering  the rib cage  and upper  limb. If successful,  the calf  is then  placed  sitting  
up with both fore legs stretched  out in front to aid lung expansion.  Recently,  
'reviving  dmgs ’ and oxygen  have  been used to resuscitate  calves. Respiratory  
stimulatnts  are available  to farmers  as drops and gels (Dopram-V  drops,  
Dallophylline  gel) and oxygen  (£80/5  year  rent)  in the form  of industrial  gas (Air 
Products  Ltd. IIG Ltd.). Very  few controlled  trials  have  been  conducted  on these  
aids in calves  but experience  at Moorepark  indicates  oxygen  may  be suitable  for 
use on larger  farms.
The future
If current  breeding  trends  continue  there  will be a further  influx  of exotic  beef 
breeds  into the Irish national  herd  and further  growth  in Holstein  cross  Friesian  
cow numbers.  With the delay  between  the introduction  and the completion  of 
evaluation  of imported  breeds  under  Irish farm conditions  the present  problems  
will persist  unless  ongoing  research  is conducted  and the information  currently  
available  is applied.  Novel  approaches  to calving  problems  including  induction  
of calving,  prediction  of problems  and elective  surgery,  all r^uire  further  
research  before  widespread  application  of these techniques.  Milk quotas  are 
likely to limit production  for the future  and in this situation  maintenance  of 
income  through  achieving  efficiencies  in cost reduction  and the use of cross ­
breeding,  particularly  specialist  beef  breeds,  will be important.

Automated  Dairy  Herd  Management
E. O'CALLAGHAN  and K. O'FARRELL  
Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
During  the past decade  microcomputer  and videotest  systems  have had an 
increasing  impact  on dairy  herd management.  Major  developments  in process  
control  systems  have  been  made  by milking  machine  manufacturers,  initially,  as 
an aid to milking  parlour  automation.  More  recently  the trend  has been  to provide  
the farmer  with a sophisticated  management  information  and control  system  in 
which  data  are collected  automatically  and all feeding  operations  are controlled.
A comprehensive  computerised  dairy  herd  management  system  (Dairymis  5) 
has been developed  at Moorepark.  The data are presenUy  entered  via the 
keyboard  of a personal  computer.  A measurement  and control  system  has 
recently  been  developed  at Moorepark  for; (a) automatic  cow identification,  (b) 
automatic  milk yield recording  using electronic  milk meters,  (c) automatic  
control  of the amount  of concentrate  fed in the milking  parlour,  (d) automatic  
printing  of the code labels  for individual  cow milk samples.  When  milking  is 
completed,  the cow numbers  and corresponding  milk yields  are entered  auto­
matically  into the Dairymis  II system.
Automatic  cow identification
Electronic  animal  identification  systems  suitable  for the reliable  operation  of 
concentrate  dispensers  for dairy  cows  are now readily  available  from  multina ­
tional  companies  in most  countries.  Electronic  identification  for  data  acquisition  
in the milking  parlour  has developed  at a much  slower  rate. Part  of the problem  
with  automatic  data  acquisition  in the parlour  has been  the difficulty  in develop ­
ing a reliable  milk meter  and the time  required  to develop  software  but the main  
problem  has been in the performance  of animal  identification  systems  them ­
selves,  placed  in routine  use in the milking  parlour. Figure 1 shows the 
components  of the transponder  identification  system  used  at Moorepark.

The transponder  is normally  in an inactive  or quiescent  state but when it 
comes  within  range  of the radio  frequency  field  produced  by the interrogating  
antenna,  it is activated  and transmits  its data  back  to the antenna.  The frequency  
used for data transmission  is generally  different  from the activating  frequency.  
The decoder  (sometimes  known  as the interrogator  or reader)  contains  a radio  
frequency  unit  (RFU)  capableof  generating  the appropriate  activating  signal  and 
converting  the signal  received  from the tag into a logic  level.

The components  of the measurement  and control  system  developed  at 
Moorepark  are:

to animal  identification  processing  equipment  located  in the milking  par­
lour. The  controller  manages  the control  devices  for all automatic  operations  
in the milking  parlour  and also measures  and captures  a wide range of 
associated  data including  animal  identification  and concentrate  
feeding  (Figure  2).

The total programme  is written  in two different  languages.  One part is in 
Macbasic,  the other  part is written  in Pascal.  The micromac  controls  all actions  
in the milking  shed and collects  all data. The programme  in the micromac  is 
written  in Macbasic  and collects  the following  data:
1. The signal  from the Eureka  decoder  which  sends  through  the tag number  of 
the cows.
2. The milk yield  of each cow.
3. The milk temperature.
4. The row in which  the cows  are located.
5. The unit in which  each cow is located.
The Pescal  programme  is used to manipulate  and print out the different  files

The performance  of the Eureka  eartag  identification  system  was measured  
with  a walk-through  overhead  antenna  at the entrance  to the milking  parlour  and 
with  an individual  overhead  antenna  at each  feed  stall. The  walk  through  antenna  
had an identification  range  of 1 meter,  the range  of the individual  overhead  
antennae  was 50 cm. The antennae  were  connected  to three  multiplex  decoders.  
Commands  for operating  the decoders  were  incorporated  into the operation  pro­
gramme  for the data collection  system.  The perf^ormance  of the two types  of 
identification  systems  is summarised  in Table  1.

The primary  reason  for the low detection  rate with individual  antennae  was 
inconsistent  placement  of the cows  head and neck  relative  to the antenna.  With  
the walk through  system,  some  cows  lowered  their heads  when  walking  under  
the antenna  and the tag was outside  the 1 meter  detection  range.
In a further  experiment  in which  two antennae  were  used,  one overhead  and 
a corresponding  antenna  under  the concrete  floor  at the entrance  to the parlour,  
99-100%  of cows  were  consistently  delected  (Table  2).

Concentrate  feeding  and milk  recording
After  the cow has been identified  with  the walk through  system  concentrates  
are automatically  dispensed.  The controller  can be linked  to any make of 
concentrate  dispenser  and the quantity  fed is programmable.  It is proposed  to 
develop  an out-of-parlour  concentrate  feeding  system.
Automatic  milk  recording  is carried  out by linking  the release  solenoids  of the 
electronic  milk meter  to counters  in the controller.  Each  release  represents  0.2 
kg of milk. When  the clusters  are transferred  across  the pit an overhead  digital  
switch  in the centre  of the milkers  pit is activated:  the counter  on the controller  
is automatically  read and then zeroed  for the next cow.
Future  developments
A relatively  cheap,  reliable  and accurate  identification  is the key to future  
developments  such as:
(1) automatic  mastitis  detection
(2) automatic  heat detection
(3) automatic  alert of cows  with digestive  disorders  or other  illness
(4) automatic  fault  detection  in milking  machines.
Mastitis  detection  could  be based  on an in-line  detector  which  measures  the 
electrical  conductivity  of milk. A profile  can be built up for each cow and by 
using  "artificial  intelligence",  changes  can be interpreted.
It is possible  to use temperature  sensor  to measure  changes  in milk  tempera ­
ture which  reflect  changes  in body temperature.  When  a cow  is in heat  both  body  
and milk  temperature  rise by a small  amount.  A profile  of each  individual's  milk  
temperature  is drawn up and changes  from iis pattern  are detected  using  
artificial  intelligence  programmes.  This  can also be used  to alert  the milker  that 
a cow has a severe  infection  requiring  immediate  attention.  A similar  system  
monitoring  feed intake  and linked  to milk temperature  could  be used to detect  
digestive  upsets  or related  illness.
Today  in some  of the more  sophisticated  cars,  an automatic  system  checkout  
is earned  out once the iginition  key is inserted  Since  some  components  of a 
milking  machine  may be malfunctioning  without  any immediate  noticeable  
effect,  a similar  automatic  checkout  system  would  be a decided  advantage.  This 
and the other  elements  of the automated  package  could  be run through  the one 
computerised  system.

Beef Production  from Silages  Produced  
from  Italian  Ryegrass,  Perennial  Ryegrass  
and Permanent  Grassland  Swards.
T. KEATING  and P. O'KIELY  
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
This paper  presents  one year's  results  (1987)  from  a three  year (1987-1989)  
programme  of research  carried  out at Grange  Research  Centre. Three  sward  
types  were compared  under  intensive  silage  conservation  systems  and subse ­
quent  annual  beef  carcass  production  per hectare  was  measured,  when  the silages  
were  offered  to finishing  steers.
Grass  accounts  for 97% of ruminant  feed in Ireland,  with silage  comprising  
one quarter  of this total (Lee, 1988). The area under  grass,  including  rough  
grazing,  is 5.2 million  hectares  or 91% of the land area used for agricultural  
purposes  (C.S.O.,  1989). Most of the grassland  (approx.  85%) consists  of 
permanent  swards  and about  3% is reseeded  annually  (Collins  and Murphy,  
1978).  Most  of the permanent  swards  are of diverse  botanical  composition  with 
relatively  low levels of ryegrass  species. The contribution  of permanent  
grassland  to the national  silage  crop is likely  to be high,  reflecting  the overall  
predominance  of these  swards  evert  though  they  may  not  be inherently  suited  for 
quality  silage  production.  The  main  sown  species  is perennial  ryegrass  but sonie  
10% of the total sown is Italian ryegrass,  the latter being sown either in 
monoculture  as a specialist  silage  crop or mixed  with perennial  ryegrass  and 
sown  as mixtures  (Culleton  and Murphy,  1987). Accordingly,  an experiment  
was carried  out at Grange  to compare  reseeded  Italian  ryegrass  and perennial  
ryegrass  swards  with an pld permanent  grassland  sward to determine  the 
following:  »
1. annaal  grass  yield  and quality  when  each sward  was managed  in 
an intensive,  unwilted,  silage  conservation  system,
2. conservation  losses  and silage  quality,
3. silage  intake  and animal  performance  by cattle  offered  these  silages,

Sward  management and grass  conservation
The OPG was an old permanent  sward  (over  40 years)  of mixed  botanical  
composition  while  the IR and PR swards  were  sown  in the autumn  previous  to 
the experiment.  The swards  were  in large  replicated  field  plots  with  a total area
38
of 3 ha. for each sward. The cutting  schedule  was designed  to optimise  
production  of high quality  grass from each sward  and was based  on previous  
res^h  findings  at Grange.  Consequently,  there  were  5 cuts of IR and 4 cuts 
each  of  PR and OPG,  with  all cuts  ensiled  separately  (cutting  dates  given  in Table  
4). Grass  was cut with  a rotary  mower  and harvested  without  wilting.  Formic  
acid was applied  m all cases. Harvested  grass  was weighed  into the silos and 
silage  subsequently  weighed  out. ApplicaUons  of P and K feitilizers  were  
^rplus  to requirements  and were  based  on soil analysis  and estimates  of P and
K remov^.  The  total annualnitrogenapplication  was  430  kg N/ha  on all swards
with applications  spread  between  cuts as shown  in Table  1.

InDecember,aftertheharvestingseason,sevensods(178mmx51 mm)were
taken  at random  from  each  plot. Plant  species  were  separated  and tiller  numbers  
per m-' were  calculated  for each sward.
Animal  production
Ninety-seven  Fmsian  steers were used with 37, 31 and 29 steers being  
allocated  to ^e IR, PR and OPG silages  respectively.  Silages  were  offered  ad 
libitum  together  with  2 kg concentrates  per head  daily. The  4 or 5 cuts  from  each  
sw^d  were  fed in sequence  over  a period  of 127 days. Steers  were  group  penned  
in slated  floor  housing  and individual  intakes  recorded  for half the animals  on 
each treatment  Carcass  weights  were  recorded  post-slaughter.
Results  and discussion
Tiller  numbers  per m^ for swards  were  3336,8331  amd 7365  for IR, PR and 
OPG respecbvley.  The IR and PR swards  contained  80% and 93% Italian  
ryep-ass  and perennial  ryegrass  respectively,  while  the remaining  tillers  in each  
ot the two swards  were  mostly  annual  meadowgrass.  The OPG  sward  contained  
rough-stacked  m^dowgrass  (33%),  Bent  sp. (31%),  perennial  ryegrass  (15%)
meadow  foxtail  (11%) and other  species,  including  weeds (10%)
The IR sward outyielded  PR and OPG by 2.6 and 2 9 t grass DM/ha  
respectively  in its first year  after  sowing  (Table  2), while  maintaining  a similar  
overall  digesubihty.  The mean yield and digestibility  of PR and OPG were

similar,  indicating  that within  the systems  chosen  there  was no  apparent  benefit  
in terms  of grass  production  and quality  to replacing  the OPG  with  PR. Previous  
research  on comparisons  between  a similar  OPG  sward  and reseeded  IR and PR 
swards  showed  that the relative  dry matter  yield per ha. per annum  of IR 
compared  to OPG  can vary from 92 to 145%  and that of PR compared  to PPG  
from  94 to 113% (Collins,  1984  and 1985;  O'Kiely  and Hynn,  1986).  Culleton,  
Murohy  and McLoughlin  (1989)  at Johnstown  Castle  Rese^ch  Centre,  reported  
an increase  in DM yield  of 60% (9.3 to 14.9 to DM/ha)  in the first year after  
reseeding,  declining  to a 36% and 13% yield  advantage  in the 2nd and 3rd year,  
respectivley.  The results  of Culleton  (1989)  indicate  that the botanical  compo ­
sition of the old permanent  grassland  sward,  and particularly  the ryegrass  
content,  will influence  the response  in DM yield  to reseeding.  The  water  soluble  
carbohydrate  (WSC)  levels in the grass juice varied considerably  between  
swards  and within  cuts of swards.  The PR sward  consistently  had higher  WSC  
levels  than  the OPG  on similar  cutting  dates.  The  lactic  buffering  capacity  (LBC)  
and WSC  are major  factors  influencing  the ensilability  of grass  and the relation ­
ship between  silage  pH (Table  3) and grass  LBC  and WSC  is described  by the 
equation:
pH =0.013  LBC - 0.036  WSC -h4.4
with correlation  coefficient  (r) = 0.78
Silage  preservation  was satisfactory  for all cuts except  third cuts of PR and

OPG which preserved  badly (Table  3). The badly preserved  silages  were  
associated  with  two levels  of WSC  in the harvested  grass  and in the case  of PR, 
a particularly  high  LBC.  Wilson  and Collins  (1980) reported  that, over  a 4 year 
period,  97%  of IR silages  had a pH of 4.2 or lower  while  only 72% and 28%  of 
PR and PPG silages  respectivley  had a pH of 4.2 or lower. This indicates  that 
ryegrass  species,  and particularly  Italian  ryegrass,  are easier  to preserve  by 
ensilage  than grass  from old permanent  grassland  swards.
Similar  animal  performance  was  achieved  by steers  on each  of the three  sward  
treatments,  with no differences  being recorded  for any of the carcass  traits  
measured  (Table  4).

Carcass  gain  per  ha (Table  5) for  each  sward  was  calculated  using  grass  yields,  
in-silo  losses,  silage  intakes  and carcass  gain data. The kill-out  rate for steers  at 
the start  of the experiment  was assumed  to be 500g/kg.  The IR and PR swards  
produced  125 and  41 kg more  carcass  per ha, respectively,  than  the OPG  sward.  
However,  even  though  individual  animals  received  the same  amount  of concen ­
trates  daily,  there  was an additional  688 and 169 kg concentrates  per ha fed to 
steers  on the IR and PR swards,  respectivley,  than  on OPG,  because  they  carried  
more  animals.

If the relative  carcass  gain per ha were  predicted  from  grass  DM yields  and 
quality,  the benefits  of the IR compared  to the other two swards  would  be 
significantly  over-estimated  (Table  6). This supports  the conclusion  that the 
evaluation  of cultivars  of ryegrass  should  be assessed  in terms of animal  
productivity  (Ribeiro,  1984) and preferably  in terms  of carcass  gain (Steen,  
1984).

The margin  over  feed  per ha was calculated  for each  sward  and the costs  and 
returns  are given  in Table  7. The relative  differences  between  swards  in returns  
pier ha should  be the same  irrespiecti  ve of the price  pier kg. carcass.  However,  the 
costs  pier ha may v^  considerably  between  individual  circumstances  and thus 
influence  the margin  over feed.

For example,  the estimated  costs  of harvesting  1 tonne  grass  DM from each  
individual  cut is given  in Table  8. The 4th cuts of PR and OPG  are particularly  
expensive,  due to low DM yields,  and it is unlikely  that farmers  would  be 
prepared  to incur  these  high  harvest  costs.  The  net  result  of omitting  the final  cuts 
of PR and OPG  swards  would  be to reduce  carcass  output  per ha (as less grass  
ensiled)  when  compared  to the IR in the intensive  silage  conservation  systems  
used,  but the feed  costs  per  ha would  also  be reduced  (3 Vs 4 harvests).  The  grass  
used  for cut 4 of PR and OPG in this experiement  would  more  logically  be used  
for grazing  animals  on farms  at the latter  end of the grass  growing  season.

The margin  over feed for the IR and PR swards  must  also cover  the cost of 
reseeding.  This  cost,  in the case  of IR, could  be spread  over  three  years  (assuming  
it is necessary  to reseed  IR after three years),  and in the case of PR could  be 
spread  over six to seven  years.
Summary
* The IR sward  had greater  DM production  than  PR and OPG,  but at the cost 
of an additional  harvest.
43
* In-silo  losses  were  highest  for IR (24%)  and lowest  forOPG  (15%)  withPR  
(20%) intermediate.
*IRandPR  swards  produced  125 and  41 kg more  carcass  per ha respectively  
than OPG.
*For  intensive  silage  production,  resowing  OPG with ryegrass  is justified.
* Results  of one year  (1987)  only. However,  the 1988  results  confirmed  the 
benefits  of reseeding.

This paper  summarises  a research  programme  carried  out by J. P. Moran  
while a recipient  of the John Flood Memorial  Scholarship.  Within  the 
programme  various  aspects  of the microbiology  and  chemistry  of  ensiling  grass  
were studied.  The overall  objective  of the programme  was to improve  our 
understanding  of the contribution  of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB)  to silage  
fermentation  under  Irish conditions.
The enumeration  of LAB on grass,  silage  and farm  machinery,  
a) A survey  of LAB numbers  on standing  and harvested  crops  of grass  
between  May and September  1988.
Grass grown  for silage was sampled  19 times during  a 20 week period  
between  May and September  1988. The grass  was sampled  randomly  from a 
variety  of pastures  immediately  before  harvesting  (standing  crop)  and immedi-  
adey after harvesting  (grass  samples  as it left the forage  harvester).  A rotary  
mower  and precision  chop  harvester  were  used  throughout  the experiment.  The 
silage  additive  (acid)  applicator  was switched  off when  grass  for sampling  was 
being  harvested.  Total  counts  of LAB  on the standing  crop  as measured  on MRS 
agar  (Table  1) were  generally  quite  high  and ranged  from 10* to 10^ CFU/g  grass.
Levels  on the standing  crop were similar  to the harvested  crop. The high 
counts  of LAB delected  on the standing  crop are not in agreement  with those  
found by Stirling  and Whittenbury,  (1963);  Muck  and O'Connor  (1985)  or 
Fenton,  (1987). The high levels  found  may have been associated  with Irish  
weather  related  factors  (low UV radiation,  high relative  humidity,  etc.), crop 
factors  (dense  high moisture  crops),  management  factors  (animal  manures  and 
silage  effluent  applied  to silage  ground;  silage  ground  grazed  late in the year)  or 
may be due to a combination  of all these  factors.

The Identification  of a random  seltetion  of LAB  colonies  isolated  from  grass  
show^ the homofermentative  LAB to account  for 54% of total  isolates.  Of the 
homofementatives  87%  belonged  to the g&ms  Lactobacillus.  Heterofermenta-  
tive LAB accounted  for 32% of total isolates  with Leuconostoc  being the 
dominant  species,  accounting  for 78%  of heterofermentative  isolates.
(b) The enumeration  of LAB on different  plant  types.
Coimts  of LAB were earned  out on different  grass genera  and one clover  
genus  (Table  2). Counts  of LAB on  grasses  and clover  were  high with Agrostis  
species  giving  rise to highest  counts.  The increased  counts  on particular  genera  
of grass  may be a genus  only effect  or it may be due to any one of a number  of 
other  effects  such as plant  growth  stage, amount  of dead material  on the plant,  
local  plant  microenvironment,  plant  morphology,  or some  stimulatory  or inhibi-  
tary conditiohs/substances  on the plants.
(c) The enumeration  of LAB on different  plant  parts.
LAB were  enumerated  on different  plant  parts  (Table  2). Counts  ofLAB  on 
all plant  parts  and on the entire  plant  were  high  ranging  from l(f to 10’ CFU/g  
^ass.  Highest  counts  were  found  on the decaying  material  at the base  of the plant  
This finding  is in agreement  with that of Stirling  and Whiuenbury  (1963),  who 
suggested  that the presence  ofLAB  were  associated  with  the release  of nutrients  
from  damaged  or decaying  plant  tissue.  In addiUon  it could  be that  theconditions  
prevailing  at the ba^  of the plant  may  encourage  the growth  ofLAB  i.e. reduced  
penefraUon  by uv light,  and a more  moist  and humid  environment.
Stirling  and Whittenbury  (1963)  found  that no LAB colonies  developeil  on 
the inflorescence,  before  or after  seed formation.  However  in the experiment

carried  out here  very  high  numbers  were  detected  ranging  from lO’ to 10’ CFU/  
g grass. These  high numbers  may be a result  of the LAB locating  in micro ­
environments  among  the seeds,  thus  protecting  them from harsh  environmental  
conditions.  High  counts  ofLAB  have  also  been  detected  on com  seed  (Miskovic  
and Rasovic,  1972;  Koch,  Moruarid  and Kirchgessner  1973).
Lower  numbers  ofLAB  were  detected  on the leaves  of the grass.  This  would  
be expected  since  leaves  are usually  orientated  to achieve  maximum  interception  
of sunlight  and hence  uv radiation.  For this reason  the leaf  provides  very little  
protection  for the LAB. These  results  are in agreement  with Moon  and Henk  
(1980)  who found  few bacteria  on the surface  or the interior  of either  wheat  or 
alfalfa  leaves.
(d) The enumeration  of LAB on the cutting  and harvesting  equipment
Counts  of LAB were enumerated  on different  parts of the cutting  and 
harvesting  equipment  (Table  3) to determine  the feasibility  of an inoculation  
effect  by the mower  or harvester.  The high counts  of LAB  recovered  on some  
parts  of new,  previously  unused  machinery  was not expected.  The machinery  
was stored  in an area adjacent  to where  silage  was stored,  fed and transported  
regularly.  It may be that counts  of LAB had been high in this general  
environment.
The  same  machinery  was  sampled  again  after  being  in regular  use throughout  
the silage  making  season.  Counts  of LAB had increased  on all machine  parts  
except  the harvester  rollers.  Highest  counts  were  detected  on the harvester  chute.  
This was expected  since  this area was  coated  with  a mat of plant  fragments  and 
debris  which  could  be a medium  for LAB  survival  and  growth.  Increases  in LAB  
numbers  on machinery  after use have also been found  by Fenton  (1987)  and 
Stirling  and Whittenbury  (1963)  where  plant  sap collects  as a result  of chopping  
or laceration  of the plant  material.

Several  investigators  have  implicated  the forage  harvester  as a major  source  
of inoculation  of grass  (Gibson  et al., 1961;  Henderson,  McDonald  and  Woolford  
1972;  McDonald,  1976;  Muck  and O'Connor,  1985; Fenton,  1987). Muck  and 
O'Connor,  (1985)  working  with alfalfa  suggested  that inoculation  by the har­
vester  would  only be effective  if the number  on the unharvested  crop was less 
than 104 CFU/g  alfalfa
(e) The enumeration  of LAB  in large scale  farm  silos in the early  stages  
of ensilage.
Numbers  of LAB were  enumerated  in large  scale  farm silos during  the first 
48 hours  of ensilage  (Table  4). Overall,  counts  of LAB  were  found  to increase  
in a similar  manner  and  pattern  to that seen  in pipe  and test tube  silos. Treatment  
with formic  acid was found  to reduce  the initial  growth  rate of LAB. This may 
be due to its ability  to bring  about  a rapid  reduction  in pH and/or  its antimicrobi^  
properties  (Saue and Breirem  1969; Woolford,  1975b). Treatment  with L. 
plantarum  resulted  in a higher  initial  number  of LAB on the harvested  grass,  
however  the numbers  detected  after  forty  eight  hours  were  similar  to those  found  
on the untreated  control.

Effect  on silage  fermentation  of bacterial  inocula  under  varying  levels  of
sucrose  addition.
Perennial  ryegrass  (22g water soluble  carbohydrate/kg  grass juice) was 
harvested  with  a precision-chop  harvester  and  ensiled  in small  plastic  silos  (6 kg 
treated  grass  per silo). It was treated  with (1) no preservative  (NP),  (2) formic  
acid (850 ^g)  at 3.0 ml/kg  (FA),  (3) Lactobacillus  plantarum  at 10® colony  
forming  units  (CFU)/g  grass  (LP),  (4) sucrose  at 4 g/kg (S4),  (5) sucrose  at 8 ^ 
kg (S8), (6) combination  of LP and S4. Five  silos  per treatment  were  opened  and 
sampled  3,8, and 45 days  after  ensiling.
Forage  from treatment  NP and LP contained  6.5 (SE.07),  9.1 (SE.08),  
9.1 (SE .03) and 8.6 (SE.06),  and  6.8 (SE .09),  9.1 (SE .02),  9.1 (SE .03),  and 8.6 
(SE .04) lactic  acid bacteria  (LAB)  Logjg  CFU/g  grass)  on days  0,3, 8, and 45,

96, 42, 85, 108, 97 and 109 g/kg dry matter  (DM) (SE = 4) (Figure  2), 
respectively.  The corresponding  values  for acetic  acid,  ethanol  and ammonia-  
N were 17,14,14,16,15  and 12 g/kg  DM (SE = 0.06),  15,44,16,19,10  and 13

of indigenous  LAB  had relatively  little  impact  on total  LAB  numbers,  or lactic  
or acetic  acid  levels.  It did reduce  ethanol  production.  Formic  acid  restricted  the 
fermentation,  reduced  ammonia-N  content  and increased  ethanol  production.  It 
also increased  the initial  flow  rate of effluent.
Effect  on silage  fermentation  of bacterial  inocula  from two sources  
A lactic  acid bacterium  (LAB)  which  was identified  as Lactobacillus  buch-  
neri  was  isolated  from  a well  preserved  silage  and grown  in de Man,  Rogosa,  and
50
Sharpe  (MRS)  broth. Italian  ryegrass  was cut using  a precision-chop  harvester  
and ensiled  in test tube silos  (90g treated  grass/silo).  Grass  was treated  with no 
additive  (NA),  L. plantarum  at 10^ colony  forming  units (CFU)/g  grass  (com ­
mercial  strain)  (LP)  andL.  buchneri  (isolate)  at 10* grass  (LB). Four  silos  were  
opened  per treatment  after 1,2,4,7,14  21,28  and 100 days ensiling.
Harvested  grass  contained  8 x 10* LAB/g  grass.  LAB numbers  in the silage  
followed  a similar  pattern  for NA and LP whereas  LB gave  rise to significantly

Conclusions
New  information  elucidated  in this work  showed  that  LAB levels  on a range  
of grasses  in Ireland  were greater  than reported  elsewhere  (Stirling  and Whit-  
tenbury,  1963; Muck  and O'Connor,  1985;  Fenton,  1987),  that substrate  availa ­
bility in the early stages  of fermentation  can limit the ability  of an added  
inoculum  (L. plantarum)  to make  an obvious  contribution  to the silage  fermen ­
tation  pattern  and that inoculation  with other  LAB (L. buchneri)  could  predis ­
pose  a silage  to a clostridial  fermentation.
The information  provided  in the experiments  reported  here improves  our 
understanding  of the ensilage  process.  It demonstrated  that
♦ A poor  fermentation  should  not usually  occur  under  Irish conditions  due 
to a shortage  of LAB.
♦ Added  inocula  have a major  challenge  to overcome  (i.e. high indigenous  
LAB numbers)  if they are to dominate  silage  fermentation.
♦ Harvesting  grass  does  not increase  the count  of LAB  if the indigenous  levels  
on the grass  are high.
♦ Highest  counts  of LAB are found  at the base  of the plant  (in the dead  or 
decaying  material)  and are lowest  on the leaf.
♦ Of the isolates  identified,  Lactobacilli  were  the dominant  bacteria  on the 
grass (64%)  with the Leuconostocs  accounting  for 32%  of isolates.
♦ LAB  can survive  on new unused,  cutting  and harvesting  machinery  and are 
increased  following  use, particularly  in the harvester  chute.
♦ Substrate  availability  can limit  the ability  of an added  inoculant  (L. planta  
rum)  to make  an obvious  contribution  to the fermentation  pattern  in the early  
stages.
♦ Added  inocula  tend  to show  improved  fermentation  when  a readily  utilisable  
form  of substrate  is supplied  with  an inoculum  rather  than  relying  on the  grass  
having  a high WSC  content.
♦ Some  LAB treatments  can disimprove  the fermentation.
♦ Clostridia  can be active  even at a pH of 3.9.
The research  results  in this paper  have implications  for recommendations  for 
silage  making.
- It has been  proposed  by Satter  et al (1987)  that  inoculants  need  to be applied  
at a rate which  adds ten times  more  LAB than the number  of indigenous  
LAB, if they are to have the desired  effect  If this is the case then most  
inoculants  in Ireland  need very high bacterial  numbers  (or more  
aggressive/active  bacteria)  and an excellent  viability/shelf  life.
- bacterial  inoculants  will frequently  need a source  of added  fermentable  
carbohydrate  if they  are to have  a noticeable  effect  on fermentation  products.
- formic  acid can significantly  increase  the effluent  flow rate in the initial  
stages  of ensilage.
- silages  which reach a pH of 3.9 in the early stages of ensilage  can, 
under  unusual  conditions,  still undergo  a clostridial  fermentation.

Factors  Affecting  the Optimum  Level  
and Protein  Content  of Concentrates  for 
Finishing  Beef  Cattle
R. W. J. STEEN
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of  Northern  Ireland,  
Hillsborough,  Co. Down.
High quality  silage  is the cheapest  source  of winter  feed for beef cattle.  
However,  even with excellent  silage,  concentrate  supplementation  is still re­
quired during the finishing  period to maintain  sufficiently  high levels of 
performance  to exploit  the growth  potential  of most  types  of cattle. It has now 
been  clearly  shown  that  as the level  of concentrate  feeding  or the protein  content  
of concentrates  given  to beef  cattle  are increased  the responses  in performance  
to each additional  increment  of energy  or protein  decline,  giving  a curvilinear  
response  to additional  inputs. Consequently  a point  is reached  when  the value  
of the extra  weight  gain is equivalent  to the cost of the extra  energy  or protein  
required  to produce  it, and this  determines  the most  economic  input  of energy  and 
protein  for any given  type of animal.
In the past  responses  to additional  concentrates  or protein  have  been  measured  
almost  entirely  in terms  of the extra live-weight  or carcass  gain produced  by 
additional  inputs.  However  with  increasing  consumer  demand  for leaner  beef  it 
had become  vitally  important  that the effects  of varying  the energy  and protein  
intakes  of beef  cattle  be assessed  in terms  of changes  in carcass  composition  and 
the output  of lean meat  as well  as the responses  in live-weight  and carcass  gain. 
Consequently  a series  of experiments  have  been  carried  out at Hillsborough  over 
the past few years  to examine  the effects  of level  of concentrate  feeding  and the 
protein  content  of the concentrates  on the performance  and carcass  composition  
of finishing  beef  cattle.
Factors  affecting  the optimum  level of concentrate  feeding.
The optimum  input  of concentrates  for finishing  cattle  is determined  by a 
number  of factors  including  the growth  potential  of the cattle,  the quality  of the 
basal  silage  diet and the overall  economics  of beef  production.
Effect  of the growth  potential  of the cattle
The  potential  of beef  cattle  for growth  and lean meat  deposition  varies  greatly  
depending  on the breed  and sex of the animal.  In experiments  at Hillsborough  
which  have  examined  the effects  of level  of concentrate  feeding  on performance  
and carcass  composition,  heifers  which  were crosses  of the continental  beef 
breeds  were  used  to represent  cattle  of low  growth  potential  and  continental  cross  
Friesian  bulls  were  used to represent  animals  of high growth  jx)tential.  Ninety  
heifers  which  were initially  about  13 months  old and 360 kg. live weight  were

given high digestibility  (dry matter  digestibility  722 g/kg), well preserved  
silages  ad libitum  and 0.6,2.4  or 4.2 kg of barley-based  concentrates  per head  
daily for 150 days.
The  effects  of concentrate  input  on performance  and carcass  composition  are 
given  in Table  1. Increasing  concentrate  input  from 0.6 to 2.4 kg/day  produced  
relatively  large  responses  in both live-weight  and carcass  gain, 150 and 140 ^ 
day resjjectivley  and approximately  half  of the extra  carcass  weight  gain was in 
the form  of lean meat. Consequendy  an extra  37 g of lean meat  were  produced  
for each extra  kg of concentrates  consumed,  or 27 kg extra  concentrates  were  
required  to produce  one extra  kg of lean meat. However  when  concentrate  input  
was  further  increased  from  2.4 to 4.2 kg/day  responses  in live-weight  and  carcass  
gain were  much  lower  than those  obtained  from the first increment  of concen ­
trates  and only 30% of the exua carcass  weight  was in the form of lean meat.  
Consequently  over  this  range  26 kg of concentrates  were  required  to produce  one 
kg extra  carcass  weight  and 82 kg extra  concentrates  were  required  to produce  
one extra  kg of lean meat,  which  is a very  poor  response  and would  certainly  be 
uneconomical  if producers  were paid for cattle  on the basis  of the lean meat  
content  in the carcass.
In subsequent  studies  continental  cross  Friesian  bulls  which  were  initially  13 
months  old and 440 kg live weight  were given  similar  high digestibility  (dry 
matter  digestibility  743 g/kg)  well  preserved  silages  as those  given  to the heifers.  
Silages  were  offered  ad libitum  and supplemented  with 2.6,3.8,5.0  and 6.2 kg 
barley-based  concentrates  (90%  barley/10%  soyabean  meal)  for 150 days. The 
effects  of increasing  concentrate  input  on performance  and carcass  compositon  
are shown  in Table  2. Again  the responses  in both live-weight  and carcass  gain 
to additional  concentrates  declined  progressivley  with each additional  incre ­
ment of concentrates.  However  responses  were much greater  than those  
obtained  with heifers. For example,  when bulls were given 2.6 to 5.0 kg

concentrates/day  the proportion  of concentrate  dry matter  in the diet  was similar  
to ^at when  heifers  were  given  2.4 to 4.2 kg/day,  yet the response  in carcass  
weight  gain to extra  concentrates  over these  ranges  was 40% greater  for bulls  
than for heifers. Furthermore,  a high proportion  (61%)  of the extra carcass  
weight  produced  in bulls  when  concentrate  input was increased  was in the form  
of lean meat Consequently  when  the concentrate  intake  of bulls  was increased  
from  2.6 to 5.0 kg/day  the increase  in the rate of lean meat  production  (40 g/kg.

creased  form  2.4 to 4.2 kg/day  (i.e. the same  range  of forage: concentrate  ratios).
These  results  clearly  show that in terms of both animal  performance  and 
carcass  composition  the optimum  input of concentrates  is much higher  for 
animals  of high  growth  potential  than for those  of low growth  potential  although  
the data for bulls and heifers  have been obtained  in different  experiments.  
However,  this impertant  interaction  between  the effects  of  plane  of nutrition  and 
the growth  potential  of the animal  has again  been  clearly  demonstrated  in sub- 
^quent  studies  at Hillsborough  in which  direct  comparisons  were  made  involv ­
ing bulls,  s^rs  and heifers  in the same  experiment.  In this case.  Continental  
cross  Friestian  bulls,  steers  and heifers,  all of which  were  initially  12 months  old 
were  given  a complete  diet  containing  two  thirds  high  digestibility  silage  and  one 
third  barley-based  concentrates  on a dry matter  basis.  Half  of the animals  of  each  
sex were  given  the dieta<i  while  the intake  of the other  half  was  restricted
to 80% of ad libitum  intake. The results  are summarised  in Table  3.
Responses  in carcass  gain to additional  food  were 169,100  and 92 g per kg 
dpf matter  for bulls,  steers  and heifers  respiectively . Furthermore,  the pjropwrtion  
of the extra  carcass  gain which  was lean meat  was 55% in bulls,  49% in steers  
and only 30% m heifers.  Consequently,  the responses  in the production  of lean 
meat  to additional  food  were  90,49  ad 28 g per  kg dry matter  for bulls,  steers  and 
heifers  respiecti  vley , the response  in bulls  being  just  over  three  times  the response  
m heifers,  as in the previous  studies.

Effect  of silage  quality
The response  in the performance  of beef  cattle  to additional  concentrates  is 
also greatly  influenced  by the quality  of the silage  available  to the cattle. The 
interaction  between  the quality  of the basal silage  diet and the response  to

supplementary  concentrates  has  been  examined  in a number  of experiments.  The 
results  of two of these  are summarised  in Table  4. In these  experiments  steers  
which  were  initially  580 kg live weight  and had been  implanted  with  hormonal  
growth  promoters  were  given  average  (D-value  630  g digestible  organic  matter/  
kg DM)  or high  quality  (D-value  707 g digestible  organic  matter/kg  DM)  silages  
ad libitum  for 80 days. Each  silage  was  supplemented  with  2.5 or 5.0 kg per head  
daily  of barley-based  concentrates.  The responses  in carcass  weight  gain  when  
concentrate  input was increased  from 2.5 to 5.0 kg were 95 and 65 g/kg 
concentrate  for the average  and high  digestibility  silages  respectively.  However  
a number  of experiments  have  shown  that responses  to concentrates  have  been  
approximately  30%  lower  with  non-implanted  steers  than  with  implanted  steers.  
Consequently  responses  of 66 and  45 g carcass  weight/kg  concentrates  would  be 
expected  over this range  with average  and high quality  silages  respectively.  
These  are in close  agreement  with those  obtained  in other experiments.  For 
example,  Drennan  (1984)  obtained  a response  of 52 g carcass  gain/kg  concen ­
trates  when  the concentrate  intake  of steers  given  fairly  good  quality  silages  was 
increased  from  19 to 34%  of total  dry matter  intake,  and in the data  given  in Table  
1 a response  of 39 g carcass  weight  gain  per kg concentrates  was obtained  when  
the concentrate  intake  of heifers  was increased  from 28 to 47% of total DM 
intake.

Taken  together  these  results  indicate  that the optimum  input  of concentrates  
for non-implanted  steers  and heifers  of average  growth  potential  is likely  to be 
of the order  of 20 to 25% of total DM intake  for high quality  silages  and 35 to 
40% of total DM intake  for medium  quality  silages.  However,  these  levels  are 
much  lower  than those  currently  used on many  farms.
The  interaction  between  silage  quality  and  concentrate  input  on a total  system  
basis  has l^n  further  examined  in a series  of six experiments  (Steen,  1988a).  In 
these  studies  a traditional  2-cut  system  of silage  making  was compared  with a 
more intensive  3-cut  system  using  perennial  ryegrass  swards. Cutting  dates,  
yields  of grass  and silage  digestibilities  are given  in Table  5. The two systems  
were  designed  to provide  equal  quantities  of aftermath  grazing  in the autumn.  
The silages  were  given  to 380 finishing  steers  for a mean  period  of 150 days.  
When  the silages  from  both systems  were  supplemented  with  2.45 kg. concen-  
trates/head  daily,  those  ^ven the 3-cut  silage  gained  0.22 kg/day  or 41% more  
c^cass  gain  than  those  given  the 2-cut  silage.  Consequently,  a concentrate  input  
of 4.9 kg/head  daily  was required  with the 2-cut  silage  to sustain  the same  level  
of carets  gain as that sustained  by the 3-cut  silage  supplemented  with  2.45  kg/ 
head  daily. However  the higher  intake  of the 3-cut  silage  reduced  the number  of 
cattle  finished/ha  of grass  ensiled  by 25%  compared  to when  the 2-cut  silage  was 
supplemented  with  the higher  input  of concentrates,  but it reduced  the quantity  
of concentrates  required  for the cattle  finished  on one hectare  of silage  by 62%.
With the current  shortage  of cattle  for finishing  in Ireland  and the overall  
economics  of beef  production,  finishing  9.4 cattle  from  a hectare  of silage  using  
3.5 tonnes  of concentrates  is likely to be much more economical  for the 
forseeable  future  than feeding  12.6 cattle  from a hectare  of silage  using  9.3 
tonnes  of concentrates.  Altemativley,  the use of an extra  2.4 hectares  of silage  
for  every  100  cattle  finished  over  the 150  day  winter  period  would  enable  the high 
quality  silage  and low input  of concentrates  to be used  rather  than the average  
quality  silage  and the high input  of concentrates,  with a saving  of 37 tonnes  of 
concentrates,  again  the high  quality  silage  system  being  much  more  economical.

Factors  affecting  the optimum  protein  content  in concentrates
The use of high-protein  concentrates,  especially  those  of low degradability,  
to improve  the performance  of finishing  cattle  offered  silage-based  diets has 
been the subject  of widespread  research  over the past few years  especially  in 
Great  Britain.  However,  most  of these  experiments  have involved  implanted  
cattle  which  have a higher  potential  for growth  and lean meat  deposition  than 
non-implanted  animals.  Consequently,  the response  to additional  protein  in the 
diet has been shown  to be lower in non-implanted  cattle than in implanted  
animals  (Steen  1988b).
Effects  with steers
In view  of the current  ban on the use of hormonal  growth  promoters  a series  
of six experiments  have  been  carried  out to examine  the effects  of supplementing  
silage-based  diets with protein  for non-implanted  steers. The silages  were  all 
well preserved  with protein  contents  ranging  from 112 to 173 g/kg DM and 
digestibilities  from 656 to 734 g digestible  organic  matter/kg  DM. In each  
experiment  the silages  were  supplemented  with 2.4 to 3.0 kg per head  daily  of 
either  mineralised  barley  or with  mixtures  of barley  and soyabean  meal  or barley  
and fish meal  containing  approximately  170 g crude  protein/kg  for periods  of 98 
to 155 days. Increasing  protein  intake  did not affect  silage  intake  or animal  
performance  but significandy  increased  carcass  fatness,  these effects  being  
consistent  across  the six experiments  (Table  6). The significant  increases  in

carcass  fat classification,  subcutaneous  fat depth  and marbling  score  (assessed  
in the cut surface  of the eye-muscle  at the 10th  rib) with  increasing  protein  intake  
are particularly  important  in view of the current  demand  fw leaner  beef.
Effects  with heifers
A series  of four  experiments  have  been  carried  out to examine  the effects  of 
increasing  the protein  content  of barley-based  concentrates  given  with  silage  to 
continental  cross  finishing  heifers.  Well  preserved  silages  of medium  to high 
digestibility  (642  to 734 g digestible  organic  matter/kg  DM)  were  supplemented  
with  0.5 to 4.5 (mean  2.5)  kg/head  daily  of either  barley  or mixtures  of barley  and 
soyabean  meal  (204  g crude  protein/kg).  The  results  are summarised  in Table  7. 
Increasing  the protein  content  of the concentrates  from 96 to 204 g/kg did not 
affect the performance  of the heifers  or carcass  fatness  as indicated  by fat 
classification,  subcutaneous  fat depth,  marbling  score  or the contents  of saleable  
meat  and fat trim when  the carcasses  were  boned  out commercially.  However,  
increasing  the protein  content  of the concentrates  significantly  reduced  the lean 
content  and increased  the fat content  of the fore-rib  joint  as determined  by total 
dissection  into  separable  lean,  fat and  bone.  Nevertheless,  the  detrimental  effects  
of increasing  protein  intake  on carcass  fatness  were  less pronounced  and were  
more  variable  in heifers  than in steers,  even though  heifers  would  generally  be 
considered  to have  a lower  growth  potential  and consequently  a lower  require ­
ment  for protein  than steers.
Effects  with bulls
The b^ on the use of hormonal  growth  promoters  in the EC has resulted  in 
renewed  interest  in Northern  Ireland  in the use of bull beef i)roduction  as a 
method  of producing  lean  beef  efficiently.  Consequently,  two  experiments  have

of performance  for bulls  in experiment  2 than for those  in experiment  1 is likely  
to have  been  due to the fact that in experiment  2 they were  at pasture  during  the 
previous  summer  and had a lower  level  of performance  and consequently  would  
have  exhibited  compensatory  growth  during  the experimental  period  while  those  
used  in experiment  1 were  indoors  throughout  their  lives  and had a high  level  of 
performance  prior  to the experiment  Orskov  etal  (1976)  found  that  sheep  which  
were  exhibiting  compensatory  growth  had a higher  requirement  for additional  
protein  than  those  which  had  previously  been  on a high  plane  of nutrition.  Similar  
effects  to those  obtained  with bulls have also been obtained  previously  with 
implanted  steers  (Steen  1988c).  When  soyabean  meal  was included  in a diet  of 
silage  and barley  there  was no response  in the performance  of steers  with  a live- 
weight  gain of 1.1 kg/day.  It would  therefore  appear  that for a given  type of 
silage,  responses  in the performance  of finishing  cattle  to additional  protein  are 
likely  to be closely  related  to the growth  potential  of the cattle.
The experiments  described  so far have involved  well preserved  silages  of 
medium  to high digestibility.  However,  the protein  in poorly  preserved  silages  
is not utilized  as well by beef cattle  as the protein  in well preserved  silages.  
Consequently,  in a recent  experiment  involving  young,  growing  cattle the 
response  in performance  when  poorly  preserved  silage  (204 g ammonia-N/kg  
total  N) was  supplemented  with  barley  and  soyabean  meal  rather  than  with  barley  
was twice  as large as the response  obtained  with a comparable  well preserved  
silage  (61 g ammonia-N/kg  total  N). There  is also limited  eyidence  to show  that 
positive  responses  to additional  protein  may be obtained  ih the performance  of 
non-implanted  finishing  steers  and heifers  when  silages  when  a low digestibil ­
ity and a low protein  content  are used.
Conclusions
The experimental  evidence  available  would  indicate  that when finishing  
steers  or heifers  are given  well  preserved  silages  of medium  to high  digestibility,  
increasing  the protein  content  of concentrates  above  lOOg/kg  will not improve  
animal  performance  and is likely to increase  carcass  fatness. However  with 
young  bulls or with steers with an exceptionally  high growth  rate, due to 
compensatory  growth  being exhibited,  increasing  protein  intake  is hkely to 
produce  some  improvement  in performance  without  affecting  carcass  composi ­
tion. Similarly,  when  badly  preserved  silages  or low digestibility  silages  with  a 
low protein  content  are used  a positive  response  in performance  may  be obtained  
to additional  protein  with most  types  of finishing  cattle.

Feeds  and the Feeding  of Finishing  
Cattle  in Winter
M. J. DRENNAN

The importance  of weight  gain for economic  success  in winter  finishing  
cannot  be overemphasised.  A daily  liveweight  gain increase  of 0.1 kg amounts  
to 15 kg over a 5 month  feeding  period  or 8 kg of additional  carcass  valued  at 
about  £20. Level  and protein  content  of concentrates  fed with  silage  to different  
breeds  and sexes  are discussed  in the previous  paper  by R. Steen.  The objective  
of the present  article  is to discuss  concentrate  feeds  and feeding  management  for 
finishing  animals
Accommodation  and feeding
To avoid  any reduction  in animal  performance  it is important  to provide  
suitable  accommodation.  In this respect  ptoints to be considered  include:  
avoiding  overstocking  on slats,  in cubicle  sheds  ensuring  adequate  cubicle  size, 
and in straw bedded  sheds the provision  of adequate  bedding. Maximum  
performance  on any diet can only  be achieved  by providing  unrestricted  access  
to the diet. For concentrate  feeing  this involves  the provision  of adequate  
feeding  space  so that all animals  can readily  feed at the same time. The area 
where  errors  most  often  arise  is that of providing  unrestricted  access  to silage.  
This  is almost  impossible  when  complete  reliance  is on self  feeding  from  the pit 
as it is very difficult  to ensure  umestricted  intake while at the same time 
attempting  to avoid  silage  losses.  Where  self  feeding  is practised  it is necessary  
to also  provide  a certain  amount  of easy  feeding  (e.g. round  feeders).  With  easy 
feeding,  edible  silage  should  be available  to the animal  at all times. This means  
discarding  inedible  material  prior to feeding  and frequent  removal  (twice  
weekly)  of deteriorated  silage  from the troughs.
Introduction  to concentrates
A considerable  quantity  of home  grown  barley  is now stored  and fed on the 
farm. This  practice  makes  good  economic  sense  and will probably  become  more  
prevalent  in the future. It is also likely  that some  of this barley  will be replaced  
by wheat  Where  high levels  of concentrate  (or roots)  feeding  is practised  there  
is a danger  of digestive  upsets  or acidosis  (accumulation  of lactic acid in the 
rumen  and a drop in rumen  pH accompanied  by going  off feed and scouring).  
This normally  occurs  during  the introductory  period  and can be avoided  by 
observing  the following  precautions  :
1. Gradual  introduction  to concentrates  (increase  by one-third  kg daily) . 
Feed  concentrates  twice  rather  than once  daily.
Use rolling  or coarse  grinding.
Ensure  free availability  of roughage  during  the introductory  period.

If fed concentrates  to appetite  it is essential  to ensure  that once  animals  have  
reached  the ad libitum  feeing  level following  gradual  introduction,  concen ­
trates  are subsequenUy  freely  available  at all times.
In practice,  where  mixing  facilities  are not available,  different  concentrate  
sources  (also  protein  and mineral/vitamin  supplements)  can be satisfactorily  fed 
by spreading  them separately  (and evenly)  along the feeding  trough. It is 
recommended  to avoid  sudden  changes  in the diet; if concentrates  are changed  
during  the feeding  period  this should  be done  gradually.
Method  of feeding  concentrates
Most  winter  cattle  feeding  operations  in Ireland  involve  grass  silage  fed to 
appetite  and the daily  allowance  of concentrates  given  in one of two feeds.  Only  
a relatively  small  proportion  of the larger  units have facilities  for feeding  the 
silage  and concentrates  as complete  diets. In one study,  once  daily  feeding  of a 
barley  based  concentrate  with silage  to appetite  was compared  with mixed  diets  
at low and high concentrate  feeding  levels. No differences  between  the two 
feeding  methods  were  evident  at the low (2.7  kg per  day)  concentrate  level  (Table  
1). However,  at the high  (5.2  kg per day)  level  of concentrates  daily  carcass  gains  
were  0.08  kg per day higher  where  the mixed  diet  was  fed compart  with  feeding  
concentrates  once  daily. In general,  the results  of studies  show  that  the expected  
improvements  in animal  performance  from  mixed  diets  as opposed  to separate  
feeding  of concentrates  and silage  are less than obtained  in this study.  In further  
studies  animals  were fed grass silage  to appetite  plus 6 kg of a barley  based  
concentrate  daily  in one of two feeds.  There  was  no effect  of treatment  on silage  
intake  but the daily  carcass  gains  were  0.027  kg higher  for those  fed concentrates  
in twos  as opposed  to one feed  daily  (Table  2). This  amounts  to an improvement

of about 4 kg of carcass  over a 150 day winter  period  from feeding  the 
concentrates  in two rather  than one feed dily. Prior  to each of these studies  
concentrates  were  introduced  gradually  and during  the introductory  periods  the 
daily  concentrate  allowances  were  given  in two feeds. Thus,  following  careful  
introduction  once  daily  feeding  of concentrates  is satisfactory  for finishing  cattle  
offered  silage  and up to 3 kg of concentrates  daily. However,  where  5 to 6 kg of 
concentrates  are fed daily with silage,  a small  but consistent  improvement  is 
evident  when  twice  rather  than once daily feeding  of concentrates  is practised.  
Purchase  of a complete  diet feeder  could  not be justified  in terms  of expected  
improvements  in animal  weight  gain even at high concentrate  feeding  levels  
when  compared  with twice  daily  feeding  of concentrates.
Processing  of grains
When  home  grown  (or purchased)  grains  are used  they are generally  either  
rolled  or ground  prior  to feeding.  Irrespective  of the processing  method,  it is 
important  that the outer  indigestible  portion  of each grain  is damaged  to ensure  
access by the rumen microbial  population  to the digestible  inner pxirtion.  
However,  fine grinding  is not necessary  and is in fact undesirable  due to 
increased  losses  of the finer  particles  and lack  of the fibre  characteristics  which  
would  be important  particul^ly  at high feeding  levels. A comparison  of rolled  
barley  and wheat  with the whole  grains  in grass  silage  based  diets  showed  that 
the dry matter  digestibility  of the rolled  and whole  grains  were  80.0%  and  42.5%  
respectively  (Table  3). These  results  clearly  demonstrate  that feeding  barley  or 
wheat  (or oats)  with even  a small  proportion  of undamaged  grains  can result  in 
an unacceptable  reduction  in grain digestibility  and consequently  in animal  
performance
Treating  grain  with sodium  hydroxide
Treatment  of whole  gram  with  sodium  hydroxide  has been  examined  recently  
as an alternative  to rolling  or grinding.  Sodium  hydroxide  treated  grain  has the 
advantage  that it can be stored  at a high  moisture  content  without  deterioration  
^d thus  drying  is not necessai^.  In one study  at Grange  fresh  barley  was mixed  
in a Keenan  Easi feeder with sodium  hydroxide,  following  which it was 
deposited  on a concrete  floor.  The  grain  was  disturbed  eight  hours  later  and  again  
after a couple  of days to avoid  setting  in a solid mass. When  compared  in a 
digestibility  study  to diets  consisting  of approximately  50 percent  grass  silage  
the digestibility  of the sodium  hydroxide  treated  grain  was 9 digestibility  units  
lower  than rolled  barley  (Table  4). Thus,  based  on this investigation  sodium

ALTERNATIVES  TO BARLEY  
Quality  of concentrates  fed with silage
The  standard  energy  source  used  as a supplement  to grass  silage  at Grange  has 
been  barley  (with  added  minerals/vitamins  and if necessary  protein).  If barley  
is to be replaced  in the feeding  programme  it is important  particularly  with 
finishing  animals  that the alternative  is also of high quality.  In three  studies  a 
high quality  concentrate  based  on barley  was compared  with a low quality  
concentrate  based  on grain screenings.  The concentrates  were fed at 6 kg per 
animal  daily (following  gradual  introduction)  in two feeds with grass silage  
offered  to appetite.  To compensate  for the lower  quality  of the concentrate,  
animals  offered  the grain  screening  consumed  more  silage  (Table  5). However,  
daily  liveweight  gains  were  0.2 kg greater  for those  offered  barley  and carcass  
gains  were  0.17  higher.  Thus,  over  a 150  day feeding  period,  carcass  weight  gain 
would  be 25.5  kg higher  for animals  offered  the concentrate  based  on barley  as 
opposed  to grain  screenings.  These  results  clearly  demonstrate  the importance  
of the quality  of the concentrate  fed as a supplement  to grass  silage.
Feeding  molasses  with silage
In two cases weaned  continental  cross suckler  bulls were fed high quality  
grass  silage  to appetite  and one of the following  supplements  per animal  daily;
A. Barley  4.0 kg
B. Barley  3.6 kg + soyabean  0.4 kg
C. Barley  2.0 kg + molasses  2.0 kg + soyabean  meal  0.3 kg
D. Barley  1.6 kg + molasses  2.0 kg + soyabean  meal  0.7 kg

Thus,  Supplements  A and B had  2 kg of barley  replaced  by 2.0 kg of molasses  
and 0.3 kg of soyabean  meal in Supplements  C and D. There  was no effect  of 
supplement  on silage intake (Table  6). Inclusion  of soyabean  with barley  
(Supplement  B) did not improve  weight  gains  over those  offered  barley  alone  
(Supplement  A). However,  animals  offered  molasses  and a low level of 
soyabean  meal  (Supplement  C) had  carcass  weight  gains  of approximately  20 kg 
lower  than  those  offered  the entire  supplement  as barley.  Inclusion  of additional  
soyabean  meal  with molasses  (Supplement  D) improved  carcass  weight  gains.  
In earlier  studies  molasses  compared  favourably  with  barley  in silage  based  diets  
at low dietary  inclusion  rates  but not at high  rates  of inclusion.  It would  appear  
from  the present  studies  that  even  at low inclusion  rates  the protein  content  of the 
diet is more  critical  where  molasses  is fed as opposed  to where  barley  is used.

Feeding  roots  with  silage
Fodder  beet roots are high in energy  and have a protein  content  of 7 to 9 
percent.  In feeding  experiments  pulped  fodder  beet  roots  alone  or with  soyabean  
meal were  compared  with barley  as a supplement  to silage  for finishing  cattle.  
A summary  of these  experiments  is presented  in Table  7.
In the various  studies,  barley  was fed at 2.5 or 3 kg per animal  daily. Animals  
fed roots  alone  or roots  plus soyabean  meal were offered  the same  amount  of 
supplement  dry matter  as the barley  group. All animals  were  given  a suitable  
mineral/vitamin  mbcture.  Daily  carcass  gain  of animals  fed silage  only  was 0.35 
kg. Feeding  a barley  supplement  with silage  increased  carcass  gain to 0.51 kg 
per day but feeding  roots  alone  only increased  gain to 0.44 kg daily. However,  
when soyabean  was included  with  roots  carcass  gains  were  almost  similar  (0.5()

kg per day)  to those  obtained  from  barley.  Silage  intakes  from similar  quantities  
of fodder  beet  and barley  dry matter  were  the same.
In conclusion,  the studies  with fodder  beet roots indicate  the very good  
response  that can be obtained  from supplementary  protein  when protein  is 
limiting.  Thus,  when preparing  diets, the addition^  weight  gain required  to 
offset  the cost of providing  additional  protein  should  be examined  when  using  
feeds  marginal  to low in protein  content.  To offset  the low crude  protein  values  
in fodder  beet (or potatoes)  approximately  1 kg of soyabean  meal (or its 
equialent)  should  be provided  for each  8 kg of roots  dry matter.  Sugar  beet  roots  
contain  only  4 to 5 percent  crude  protein  and where  fed, about  1 kg of soyabean  
meal should  be given  for each  4 kg of roots  dry matter.  This additional  protein  
will provide  a crude  protein  content  of the mixture  similar  to that of barley.
Feed Additives
Feed  additives  that are available  commercially  include  Romensin  (Monen-  
sin), Avotan  (Avoparcin)  and Havomycin.  Most  studies  with feed  additives  at 
Grange  using  finishing  animals  in winter  have  been  conducted  with  Romensin.  
In a summary  of four experiments  with animals  fed silage  and concentrates  in 
winter,  Romensin  increased  liveweight  and  carcass  gains  by 103 and 51 g per  day 
respectively  (Table  8). In these studies  the effects  of Romensin  on voluntary  
silage  intake  were  minimal.  While  the data are limited  for other  feed  additives  
with  finishing  cattle,  studies  with  weanlings  were  similar  to those  using  Romen ­
sin (increased  liveweight  gain  of 65 g per day).

Supplementary  minerals  and vitamins
Although  grass  silage  is usually  balanced  for minerals,  feeds  such  as barley  
and other  cereals  are low in calcium  whereas  pulp,  roots  and molasses  are low 
in phosphorus.  Potatoes  are also rather  low in phosphorus  and are very low in 
calcium.  Thus, in silage/concentrate  diets,  50 to 100 g per animal  daily of a 
suitable  mineral  and vitamin  mixture  should  be provided  (i.e. about  20 g per kg 
of concentrates).  Where  home grown feeds are used and the silage and 
concentrates  are fed separately  then the mineral/vitamin  (and  protein  if needed)  
supplement  can be satisfactorily  fed by spreading  it evenly  over  the concentrates  
at feeding  time.
Parasite  control
With  heavy  animals,  anthelmintics  for the control  of liver  fluke  are generally  
necessary.  While  treatment  for the control  of hoose  and worms  (effective  against  
Ostertagia  stage  II) is always  necessary  with  weanlings,  there  are circumstances

where  control  measures  would  also be required  with older  animals.  Animals  
must  also be treated  for the control  of lice.
Nutritive  value  of feeds
The metabolisable  energy  (ME)  system  is the system  used  in Ireland  and the 
U.K.  to describe  the energy  value  of feeds. While  this system  effectively  ranks  
the various  feeds in order of nutritional  value it does not directly  allow  
calculation  of relative  monetary  values. The reason  is that the ME of higher  
energy  feeds  such  as barley  is used  more  effectively  than  is that of lower  energy  
feeds. A more  appropriate  energy  system  is that used in the U.S. where,  feeds  
assigned  net energy  for maintenance  and net energy  for gain  values.  Assuming  
that two-thirds  of the feed  energy  is used  for maintenence  and one-third  is used  
for weight  gain, a single energy  value for each feed has been calculated.  
These  values  relative  to the comparable  value  for rolled  barley  are shown  in 
Table  9.
Likewise,  the protein  value  of feeds  is generally  shown  as crude  protein  but 
because  the crude  protein  values  of two feeds  are similar  they  are not necessarily  
equally  effective  sources  of protein.  The digestibility  of protein  in feeds  such  as 
roots  is lower  than  that in barley  and in the extent  to which  protein  escapies  break ­
down  in the rumen  but is digested  further  along  the digestive  tract also varies  
between  feeds. Within  the above  considerations  relatively  accurate  monetary  
values  can be calculated  for feeds  relative  to one another.  This is done  in Table  
9 using  (A) the net energy  value  assuming  two-thirds  for maintenence  and one- 
third  for weight  gain  relative  to barley  except  where  protein  content  is lower  than 
barley  and (B) the net energy  value  and digestible  crude  protein  as the basis  of 
companson.  Barley  and soyabean  meal  are used  as standards  for the purpose  of 
comparison.
Cereal  grains
Barley  is the main cereal  used for cattle  feeding  in Ireland  and is used as a 
smndard  with which  other feeds are compared.  Both maize  and wheat  have  
higher  energy  values  whereas  oats has a lower  value  (1.16  kg of oats = 1 kg of 
barley).  Although  wheat  is higher  in feeding  value  than barley  it is more  likely  
to cause digestive  upsets. Digestive  upsets can be minimised  by gradual  
introduction,  using rolling  or coarse  grinding  and feeding  concentrates  twice  
rather  than once daily.
Molassed  beet pulp and citrus  pulp
These  contain  90% to 95% the feeding  value of barley. Compared  with 
barley,  they tend to be lower  in phosphorus  (which  is high  in barley)  and thus a 
high phosphorus  mineral/vitamin  supplement  should  be used. This is also 
necessary  where  roots  or molasses  is fed. It is noteworthy  that citrus  pulp is a 
variable  product  and ME values  lower  than that  presented  can be obtained.  The 
crude  protein  content  is about  6.5%.
Tapioca
Although  similar  to barley in energy,  it is very low in protein  (2 7% 
protein).

Molasses
Molasses  is low in crude  protein  (and  phosphorus)  and the availability  of the 
protein  IS also low. The energy  value  is about  two-thirds  that of barley.  The  dry 
matter  content  is about  74%. Asa  general  rule the level  of molasses  should  not 
exceed  15% of total dietary  intake.
High  protein/high  energy  feeds
The  standard  protein  feed  is soyabean  meal  which  has an energy  value  similar  
to barley  and  contains  45-50%  crude  protein.  However,  feeds  such  as com  gluten  
feed,  peas,  cotton  seed and com distillers  grains  are often  available  at competi ­
tive prices  and could  be included  in catUe  rations. Com distillers  grains  are 
similar  to barley  in energy  terms  and have  a cmde  protein  content  of 25%. The 
energy  v^ue  of com  gluten  feed  is somewhat  lower  than barley  but like most  by­
products  it is quite  variable.  In feeding  studies  at Grange,  while  weight  gains  of 
animals  fed com  gluten  were  similar  to those  offered  barley/soyabean  meal,  feed 
intakes  were higher  for those  fed com gluten. Overall  the results  showed  that 
com  gluten  had  only  about  90%  the feeding  value  of  barley/soyabean  meal  which  
gives  it a somewhat  lower  value  than that shown  in Table  9.
High protein/low  energy  feeds
Feeds  such  as rape  seed  meal,  malt  culms,  sunflower  meal  and  brewers  grains  
f^l into this category.  They  are lower  in energy  than  barley  but are good  sources  
of protein.  Wet  brewers  grains  can be satisfactorily  ensiled  and there  is no need  
for preservative.  Malt culms  are variable  and can be lower in quality  than 
indicated.  They  are unpalatable  because  of their bitter  taste and much  of the 
cmde  protein  is present  in the form of non-protein  nitrogen.
Whey
Delactosed  whey  contains  about  30%  dry matter.  It is high  in ash (20%  of the 
dry matter)  and  cmde  protein  (25/%  of the dry matter).  In feeding  trials  involving  
comparisons  of whey  with  barley/soyabean  meal  on a similar  dry matter  basis  as 
supplements  to silage  and  straw,  animal  weight  gains  were  the same.  Thus,  whey  
concentrate  can contain  up to 60% dry matter  and is comparable  to barley  on a 
dry matter  basis. However,  the composition  and particularly  the dry matter  
content  of whey can vary considerably  and therefore  the actual value of a 
particular  batch  will depend  largely  on its dry matter  content
Pressed  beet pulp
Pressed  beet pulp (dry matter  content  20%) can be successfully  ensiled  
without  a preservative.  The ensiled  pressed  pulp is a high quality  feed but the 
protein  quality  is lower  than barley.  This should  be kept  in mind  particularly  at 
high dietary  inclusion  rates or when  fed to young  animals.
Roots  and potatoes
Due to variable  levels  of soil contamination  and likely  greater  storage  losses  
It IS very  difficult  to place  monetary  values  on roots  and potatoes  relative  to that 
of barley. In addition,  handling  of roots and potatoes  is more difficult  and
76
equipment  for chopping  the roots is not available  on most farms. It is also 
noteworthy  that  roots  such  as fodder  beet  can vary,  from  about  12%  to 18% in dry 
matter  content  depending  on variety  and this has a major  influence  on value  per 
tonne  of roots. D^pite  the above  limitations  it can be taken  that  in energy  terms  
1 kg of dry matter  from roots  or potatoes  is equivalent  to 1 kg of rolled  barley.  
However,  to allow  for tare,  roots  and  potatoes  should  be discounted  a further  20% 
approximately.  Sugar  beet roots  have  a dry matter  content  of about  22% and a 
crude content  of fodder  beet  roots  used in Grange  feeding  trials  was 8.6%. To 
allow  for the lower  crude  protein  values  approximately  1 kg of soyabean  meal,  
or the equivalent  from  other  protein  sources  should  be provided  for each 8 and 
4 kg of fodder  beet  (or potatoes)  and sugar  beet  dry matter  fed,  respectively.  This 
additional  protein  will provide  a crude  protein  content  of the mix similar  to that 
of barley.
Roughages
Grass  conserved  as silage  or hay forms  a large proportion  of winter  feed 
requirements.  The nutritive  value of conserved  grass is very variable.  In 
common  with roots  the value  per tonne  of silage  is influenced  dramatically  by 
dry matter  content  but for convenience  a value  of 20%  is assumed.  Because  high 
levels of production  are required  with finishing  animals  only high quality  
conserved  grass  should  be considered  in those  diets  where  roughage  forms  a high 
proportion  of the total diet.

Productivity  of  Different  Steer  Breed  Types  
for Beef  Production
M. G. KEANE
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
Over 70% of all cows are dairy cows, predominantly  Friesians.  The 
remainder  are suckler  cows,  predominantly  beef  breed  x Friesians.  Thus,  the vast 
majority  of cattle  for beef  production  are the progeny  of either  Friesian  or beef 
breed  x Friesian  cows. In 1988  and 1989,  approximately  40%  of inseminations  
were  to Friesian,  30%  were  to traditional  beef  breed,  and 30%  were  to continental  
beef breed bulls. To provide  adequate  dairy herd replacements,  Friesian  
inseminations  should  be around  45%, so for the foreseeable  future,  the most  
numerous  single  breed  type of beef  catde  will be Friesian.
Because  of the number  of different  breed  types  available,  it is essential  that 
producers  understand  clearly  the differences  betweeen  them and how the 
desirable  characteristics  of each  can best  be exploited.  To provide  the necessary  
background  information  for this,  a number  of large  scale  experiments  have  been  
earned  out at Grange  in recent  years. The overall  approach  has been  to use the 
Friesian  as a continuous  standard  and to compare  two other  breeds  with the 
Friesian  in individual  experiments.  Then,  at the end of a series  of experiments  
the data for all the breed  types  are ranked  relative  to the Friesian
Comparison  of Friesians,  Hereford  x Friesians  and 
Charolais  x Friesians
The first comparison  involved  Friesian,  (British)  Hereford  x Friesian  and 
Charolais  x Friesian  steers. These  breed  types  represent  about  two thirds  of all 
male beef cattle originating  in the dairy herd. The main results  from this 
comparison  are shown  in Tables  1,2 and 3. Corrected  to the same  slaughter  date 
(750  days  of age),  Friesians  and Hereford  crosses  had similar  slaughter  weights  
but Charolais  crosses  were  38 kg heavier  than  Friesians  (Table  1). Hereford  and 
Charolais  crosses  killed-out  1 % and  2% units,  respectively,  higher  than  Friesians  
with  the result  that respective  carcass  weights  were  10 kg and 32 kg heavier  than

Friesians.  Herefords  had better  conformation  but had a higher  fat score  than 
Friesians.  Charolais  crosses  had better  conformation  and a lower  fat score  than 
either  of the other  two breed  types.
Herefords  had least  bone  and  Friesians  and  Charolais  crosses  had  similar  bone  
proportions  (Table  2). Herefords  had also least muscle  and most  fat while  the 
Charolais  crosses  had most muscle  and least fat. Herefords  had a higher  
proportion  of their  fat subcutaneously  than the other  two  breed  types  which  were  
similar.  This difference  between  breeds  in fat distribution  has implications  for 
the visual  grading  of carcasses  for famess.  Feed intake,  measured  during  the 
finishing  period  showed  (Table  3) that Charolais  consumed  more  feed per day 
than the other  two breed  types. However,  they  were also heavier.  Hence  when  
feed intake  was scaled  for body  weight  no difference  existed  between  the breed  
types. Friesians  and Herefords  had a similar  muscle  size (as indicated  by 
longissimus  dorsi area) and had similar  proportions  of higher  value muscle.  
Thus,  the superior  conformation  of the Herefords  was not reflected  in increased  
muscle  proportion,  muscle  size  or proportion  of higher  value  muscle.  Charolais  
crosses  had a considerably  larger  muscle  size and an increased  proportion  of 
higher value  muscle.

higher  than Friesians  and as a result their carcasses  were 10 kg and 27 kg, 
resj^tively, heavier  than the Friesian  carcasses.  Both  beef  crosses  had better  
conformation  than Friesians  and Blondes  had a lower  fat score.
Fnesians  had most  bone,  most  fat and least  muscle  (Table  5). Limousins  had 
less bone  than Blondes  but they  also  had less muscle  and more  fat. Silage  intake  
during  finishing  was similar  for the three  breed  types  both  in absolute  terms  and 
as a function  of liveweight  (Table  6). The two b^f  crosses  had larger  muscle  
sizes and higher  proportions  of their muscle  in the higher  value cuts than

Comparison  of Friesians,  Canadian  Hereford x Friesians and

The third  comparison  involved  Friesian,  Canadian  Hereford  x Friesian  and 
bimmental  x Friesian  steers. The main results  are in Tables  7, 8 and 9. The
80
Canadian  Hereford  was imported  to improve  the beef  merit  of Hereford  cross  
catde  generally  and it has been claimed  that data obtained  with the traditional  
British  Hereford  are not applicable  to the progeny  of Canadian  Hereford  sires.  
Canadian  Herefords  and Simmentals  were  26 and 33 kg, respectively,  heavier  
than Friesians  at slaughter  (Table  7). They also had 1% and 2% units,  
respectively  higher  killing-out  proportions  than Friesians  and as a result  car­
casses  were 21 and 27 kg heavier  for Canadian  Herefords  and Simmentals  
respectively.  Both beef crosses  had better  conformation  than Friesians  and 
Canadian  Herefords  had a higher  fat score  than the other  two breed  types  which  
were similar.
Canadian  Herefords  had least  bone but they also had least  muscle  and most  
fat (Table  8). Friesians  had most  bone  while  Simmentals  had most  muscle  and 
least  fat As described  previously  for British  Herefords  Canadian  Herefcffds  had

a higher  proportion  of their  fat in the subcutaneous  depot  than  the other  two  breed  
types.  Simmentals  tended  to have  a higher  silage  intake  than  the other  two  breeds  
but there  was no difference  when  silage  intake  was expressed  as a function  of 
liveweight  (Table  9). Friesians  and  Canadian  Herefords  had similar  muscle  sizes  
and similar  proportions  of their  muscle  in the higher  value  cuts.  Simmentals  had 
a larger  muscle  size and more  of their muscle  in the higher  value  cuts.
Relative  performance  of breed  types
The performance  of all the breed  types  evaluated  to date  relative  to Friesians  
is summarised  in Tables  10 and 11. The value  for the Friesians  for each trait is 
set equal  to 100 and the correspondng  values  for the other  breeds  are expressed  
relative  to 100. Except  for the Simmental  and Charolais  crosses  which  were  
heavier,  the other  breed  types  did not  differ  greatly  in slaughter  weight  corrected  
to a constant  age (Table  10). All the beef  crosses  had a higher  kill-out  ratio  than 
Friesians  and the continental  beef crosses  were higher  than the Herefords.  
Because  of the differences  in kill-out,  the ranking  of the breed  types  for carcass  
weight  for age was different  than  for slaughter  weight  for age. Compared  with  
the Friesians,  the beef  crosses  produced  3% to 11 % more  carcass  weight  for age. 
All beef crosses  had considerably  better  conformation  than Friesians  with no 
major  differences  between  the beef  crosses  themselves.  Friesians,  Limousins  
and Simmentals  had similar  fat scores,  Herefords  had higher  fat scores  than all 
others  and Charolais  and Blonde  crosses  had lower  fat scores  than all others.
Friesians  and Herefords  had similar  muscle  weights  for age, similar  muscle  
sizes  and similar  proportions  of higher  value  muscle  (Table  11). All continental  
crosses  had considerably  higher  weights  for age and muscle  sizes  than  Friesians  
and Herefords.  Higher  value muscle  proportion,  although  higher for the 
continentals,  did not differ  much  between  breed  types. Other  than Herefords

which  had higher  values,  the proportion  of fat in the subcutaneous  depot  was 
similar  for the other  breed  types.
The data in Tables  10 and 11 permit  a comparison  of the two strains  of 
Hereford.  Other  than  a difference  in growth  rate which  resulted  in the Canadian  
strain having  a 3% higher  slaughter  weight  for age and a 4% higher  carcass  
weight  for age, the two strains  were  similar.
Comparison  of breed  types  at similar  fatness
Because  of the differences  beween  the breed  types  in carcass  composition,  
animals  from different  breed  types  if slaughtered  at the same  age would  have  
very  different  proportions  of fat and muscle.  Because  of this,  animals  of  different  
breed  types  are usually  not slaughtered  at the same  age  or weight  - some  account  
is taken of fatness  or finish.  The slaughter  and carcass  weights  at which  the 
different  breed  types  would  have the same  proportion  of carcass  fat are shown  
in Table 12. Assuming  that the optimum  slaughter  and carcass  weights  for 
Friesian  steers  is 600 kg and 320  kg respectively,  Herefords  (both  strains)  would  
have a similar  carcass  fat proportion  at correspondng  slaughter  and carcass  
weights  of 530 kg and 280 kg. Limousins  can be taken  to 50 kg liveweight  and 
40 kg carcass  weight  heavier  than Friesians  while  the other  continentals  can be 
taken  to 80-120  kg liveweight  and 60-90  kg carcass  weight  heavier  than  Friesians  
at a similar  level  of carcass  fatness.  As kill-out  proportion  varies  with  weight  for 
all breed  types  the kill-out  values  shown  in Table  12 differ  from those  shown  
earlier  where  slaughter  weights  differ.

Comparison  of international  results
A number  of breed  comparisons  have been carried  out in other  countries  in 
recent  years  but it is often  difficult  to compare  the results  of experiments  from  
different  countries  because  the breeds  used  are not always  the same,  production  
systems  vary and the methodology  particularly  for carcass  assessments  differs  
between  countries  and laboratories.  Therefore,  comparisons  of international  
results  must  be treated  with caution.
Dairy  herd progeny
In Great  Britain  the Meat  and Livestock  Commission  (MLC)  have  conducted  
a number  of evaluations  of the progeny  of dairy  cows  and various  sire breeds  in 
recent  years  (Southgate,  Cook  and Kempster,  1982a,  1988;  Kempster,  Cook  and 
Southgate, 1982a, 1988).  TheMLCvaluesforcarcassweightforageandmuscle

14. Blonde  d'Aquitaine  crosses  were  not included  in the MLC  experiments  and 
Limousin  crosses  were  not included  in two of their  comparisons.  Even  with  the 
four  MLC  Comparisons,  there  was  considerable  variation  in the magnitude  of the 
differences  between  breed  types  in carcass  weight  for age (Table  13). Relative  
to Friesians  at 100,  Limousins  were  104 and 112 in the two  comparisons  in which  
they were  included,  Simmentals  ranged  from 106 to 112 and Charolais  ranged  
from 115 to 119. This  indicates  that the differences  between  breed  types  shown  
in any one experiment  should  be regarded  as approximations  and not absolutes.  
The Grange  and MLC  results  are similar  for Friesians,  Herefords  and Simmen ­
tals, but the superiority  of the Charolais  crosses  was greater  in all four MLC  
comparisons  than in the Grange  comparison.  In the case  of the Limousins,  one 
of the MLC  results  was similar  to the Grange  result  while  the other  MLC result  
was  better.  Notwithstanding  these  differences  however,  the overall  pattern  of the 
results  was similar.  In all five comparisons,  the Charolais  crosses  were  superior  
to all others. In four of five comparisons  the Simmentals  were supierior  to all 
others  except  the Charolais  crosses.  In two of three  comparisons  the Limousins  
were  inferior  to the Simmentals  and  in all three  they  were  superior  to the Friesians  
and Herefords  which for all practical  purposes  were similar. Thus in five 
separate  comparisons  there  is dmost  complete  agreement  in the ranking  of the 
breeds  for carcass  weight  for age.
Table  14 shows  relative  muscle  weights  for age for the Grange  and four  MLC  
comparisons.  As with carcass  weight  for age, there  are the differences  between

the breed  types. However,  the ranking  of the breeds  was virtually  consistent  
across  the five comparisons.  As with carcass  weight  for age, there are some  
differences between  the MLC  experiments  in the magnitude  of the differences  
between  the breed types. However,  the ranking  of the breeds  was virtually  
consistent  across  the five comparisons.  In all five comparisons,  the charolais  
crosses  ranked  highest  and in four  of the five  the Simmentals  ranked  next. In one 
comparison,  the Limousin  surpassed  the Simmentals.  There  was  abig  difference  
between  all of the continent^  crosses  on the one hand and the Friesians  and 
Herefords,  which  were  similar,  on the other.
Suckler  herd progeny
Because  the Grange  comparisons  were carried  out using Friesians  and 
Friesian  crossses,  it would  be useful  to know  if the differences  between  sire 
breeds  found  with  Friesian  dairy  cows  would  apply  also  with  beef  suckler  cows.  
Because  the Hereford  is the predominant  sire breed  used in suckler  herds,  the 
Hereford  was  taken  as the standard  for this  evaluation  and  the Hereford  data  from  
Grange  were  set equal  to 100. In addition,  the data  from  three  other  comparisons  
(Germ Plasma  Evaluation  Program,  1974; Southgate,  Cook and Kempster,  
1982b;  Kempster,  Cook  and Southgate,  1982b)  of the progeny  from suckler  
cows were summarised.  In carcass  weight  for age the Charolais  crosses  were  
superior  to all other breed types (Table  15). Simmentals  were superior  to 
Herefords  in all five comparisons  and in four comparisons  with  Limousins  the 
Simmentals  were  superior  each  time. In the two  comparisons  involving  Blondes,  
they were superior  to Limousins  in both, and to Simmentals  in one of the 
comparisons.  Limousins  were  superior  to Herefords  in three  of four compari ­
sons and equal to them in the remaining  comparison.  In all comparisons,  
Blondes,  Simmentals  and Charolais  crosses  were  superior  to Limousins.
In muscle  weight  for age (Table  16), the pattern  was  similar  to that  for carcass  
weight  for age except  that the difference  between  Herefords  and Limousins  was 
much  greater.  In all five  comparisons,  the Charolais  crosses  were  superior  to all 
others. In the two comparisons  in which  they were  included,  the Blondes  were  
superior  to the Simmentals,  the Simmentals  were  superior  to the Limousins  and 
as indicated  the Limousins  were  much  superior  to the Herefords.

It is clear  therefore  that in different  countries  involving  different  production  
systems,  foundation  stock  and slaughter  weights,  there  is remarkable  agreement  
on the ranking  of the different  breed  types. In all nine separate  comparisons  of 
carcass  weight  for age involving  Herefords,  Simmentals  and Charolais  were  at 
^e top and the Herefords  were at the bottom  in all nine. In six comparisons  
involving  Limousins,  they were  superior  to Herefords  in all six, they  were  never  
superior  to Charolais  and were superior  to Simmentals  only once. In two 
comparisons  involving  Blondes,  they were superior  to Limousins  in both and 
superior  to Simmentals  in one. For all practical  purposes,  Friesians  and 
Herefords  can be considered  similar. In terms  of muscle  weight  for age (not 
shown)  the trends were similar  to carcass  weight  for age except  that the 
differences  were  greater.  All of the continental  crosses  were  at least  8% superior  
to the Friesians  and Herefords  which  were similar. Charolais  crosses  were  
superior  to all others  except  the Blondes  in one comparison.  The Blondes  were  
superior  to the Simmentals  in the two comparisons  in which  they  were included  
and the Simmentals  were  superior  to the Limousins  in five of the six compari ­
sons.
Conclusions
1. Approximately  40% of dairy-bred  male cattle for beef production  are 
Friesians,  30%  are Angus  and Hereford  x Friesians  and 30%  are continental  
X Friesians.
Breeds  differ  in many  characteristics  but feed intake  per unit liveweight  is 
fairly  similar  for all breed  types.
Carcasses  of Friesian  steers slaughtered  at around  two years of age 
following  moderately  intensive  rearing  weigh  about 320 kg. If reared  
similarly  and slaughtered  at the same  time,  carcasses  of Hereford,  Canadian
Hereford,  Limousin,  Blonde  d'Aquitaine,  Simmental  and  Charolais  crosses  
would  weigh  330, 342,330 346, 349 and 355 kg resfiectively.
Carcass  weights  at similar  levels  of carcass  famess  for Friesian,  Hereford,  
Canadian  Hereford,  Limousin,  Blonde  d'Aquitaine,  Simmental  and Charo ­
lais crosses  are 320, 280,280  ,360,410,  380 and 400 kg respectively.
All beef crosses  have higher  kill-out  rates than Friesians  and continental  
crosses  have higher  rates than Hereford.

5.
6. All  beef  crosses  have  better  conformation  than  Friesians  but within  the beef 
crosses,  differences  in conformation  are small.
7. Continental  crosses  have  larger  muscle  sizes  and higher  proportions  of their  
muscle  in the higher  value  cuts  than  Friesians  and Herefords,  between  which  
there is little difference  in these  respects.

Introduction
The biological  efficiency  of suckler  beef  production  is limited  by the cow's  
reproductive  rate,  a maximum  of one  calf  per  cow  per year,  and  by the rate  of  gain 
of the calf. These  limitations  are often  compounded  by late calving,  extremely  
long  calving  intervals,  and high  culling  rates  because  of barrenness.  Because  the 
suckler  cow enterprise  is largely  a breeding  enterprise,  financial  returns  depend  
on getting  the cow to calve at the optimum  time each year. Reproductive  
performance  is, therefore,  very important  Because  of the suckling  effect  of the 
calf,  the cow  is endocrinologically  and physiologically  differentto  the dairy  cow 
in terms  of onset  of  cyclicity  and  oestrous  behaviour.  Also,  in attempts  to further  
increase  the econimic  efficiency  of the enterprise  they are managed  and fed 
differently . For  example,  they  are allowed  to accumulate  body  reserves  over  the 
grazing  season,  these  reserves  are then  mobilized  during  the winter  to supply  part 
of their  energy  requirements.  It is important  to understand  the implications  of 
these differences  for reproductive  performance  and how their effects  can be 
minimized.
The objectives  of a good breeding programme  should  include
1. 365 day calving  interval.
2. Early  compact  calving  with 90% of cows calving  in 8 weeks.
3. A replacement  rale of less than 20%.
Resumption  of post-partum  cyclicity
One  of the major  limitations  to improvement  of reproductive  efficiency  is the 
extended  ix>st-partum  period  which  is longer  in suckler  than in dairy cows.  
Recent  research  has elucidated  some  of the endocrine  events  involved  in the 
resumption  of cyclicity  post-partum  and these  are briefly  summarised.
Endocrine  events  leading  to first ovulation
During  pregnancy  the high circulating  concentrations  of progesterone  and 
oestradiol  result in prolonged  negative  feedback  on the hypKDthalamic-hypo-  
physial  axis resulting  in an inhibition  of the synthesis  of luteinizing  hormone  
(LH) by the anterior  pituitary  gland. This in turn results  in the depletion  of 
pituitary  stores  of LH and in a reduction  in basal  release  rates. After  calving  a 
two-phase  recovery  of the hypothalamic-hypophysial-gonadal  axis  occurs.  The 
first phase  lasting,  two to five weeks,  is characterised  by relatively  infrequent  
discharges  of gonadotrophin  releasing  hormone  (GnRH)  into the hypothalamic-  
hypophysial  portal  circulation,  about  one pulse  every  4-8 hours. This mode  of 
GnRH  secretion  effectively  stimulates  the biosynthetic  machinery  in the gona ­
dotrophs  and the rate of synthesis  of LH increases.  The pulses  of GnRH  are
88
sufficiently  spaced  that most  of the newly  synthesised  LH is conserved  rather  
than secreted  into peripheral  circulation.  During  this early  post-partum  period  
the pulses  of LH are of insufficient  magnitude  to induce  follicular  maturation.  
When  pituitary  stores  of LH have  returned  to normal,  pulses  of LH of sufficient  
amplitude  and frequency  are released  into the circulation  to stimulate  follicular  
growth.  This marks  the beginning  of the second  phase  of the recovery  process.  
During  the second  phase,  the increased  circulating  concentrations  of LH stimu ­
late growth  of ovarian  follicles  and the resultant  secretion  of oestradiol.  The 
increased oestradiol  secretion  increases  the sensitivity  of the hypothalamic  and 
hypophysal tissues  to the positive  feedback  effects  of oestradiol.  At this point,  
the frequency  of  discharges  of  GnRH  increases,  in turn,  producing  more  frequent  
pulses  of LH. These  events  lead  to the final  stages  of follicular  development  and 
culminate  in ovulation.
The first  phase  of this recovery  process  (events  leading  to increased  pituitary  
stores  of LH) are believed  to be relatively  independent  of the suckling  stimulus  
and of genetic  and environmental  factors. However,  the second  phase  of the 
recovery  (events  leading  to increased  frequency  of discharges  of LH) appear  to 
be tightly  coupled  to the suckling  stimulus  as well as to a variety  of genetic  and 
environmental  factors.  Some  of the more  important  factors  are discussed  here.
Suckling  effects
It is now well established  that it is the suckling  stimulus  rather  than lactation  
itself that increases  the interval  to the first oestrus. Suckling  will suppress  
pulsatile  secretion  of LH fora  longer  period  after  parturition  than  milking  peters  
et al, 1981),  even when  milking  is increased  to four times  per day (Carruthers  
& Hafs, 1980). Evidence  is emerging  that the suckling  induced  inhibition  of 
reproductive  function  is exerted  through  the release  of endogenous  opoid  
peptides  which  suppress  the secretion  of GnRH  in turn suppressing  the secretion  
of LH. The inhibitory  effect(s)  of the endogenous  opioid  peptides  seem  to be 
short-lived  since  cows  must  suckle  more  than four  times  per day before  the post 
partum  interval  is extended.  Therefore,  the inhibition  of LH secretion  is 
observed  in cows  whose  calves  are allowed  to suckle  ad libitum  but not in cows  
that are milked  twice  daily. Inhibition  of this phase  of recovery  process  persists  
until the suckling  stimulus  and/or  environmental  stressors  are reduced  to the 
point where  more frequent  discharges  of GnRH  begin to occur. The above  
information  can be combined  within  a management  strategy  to overcome  some  
of the consequences  of the suckling  effect.
There  is emerging  evidence  that the physical  presence  of the calf  has effects  
on both the interval  from calving  to first ovulation  and also on the intensity  of 
oestrus  in suckler  cows.
Nutrition  and reproductive efficiency  in suckler cows
Cow  nutrition  is the most  important  factor  influencing  suckler  beef  produc ­
tion. Feed costs alone  account  for approximately  75% of the variable  costs  
involved.  There  is extensive  evidence  which  links  nutrition  to the duration  of the 
post-partum  interval  and to variations  in subsequent  calving  rate. However  the 
relationship  is complex  and involves  interactions  between  nutrient  intake,
89
weighuhange,  body  condition,  cow live  weight  and age, milk  yield  and suckling  
intensity.  A further  difficulty  with suckler  cows is that they differ  in their  
response  to a given  level of nutrition  due to differences  in age, size, milk  yield,  
stage of gestation,  environment  and body condition.  To overcome  these  
difficulties  in describing  the nutrient  requirements  of suckler  cows a body  
condition  scoring  system  has been  developed.  Condition  scoring  on a scale  of 1 
(very  thin and emaciated)  to 5 (grossly  overfat)  is a semi-objective  measurement  
of the fat reserves  of the cow. It has been shown  to be a good  indicator  of the 
cow ’s nutritionl  status  and equally  important,  a good  predictor  of her likely  future  
performance.  This has led to the concept  target  body condition  score  at critical  
stages  of production.  Other  aspects  of using  target  condition  scores  are that they 
allow  for the accumulation  of body  reserves  in summer  when  feed  costs  are low, 
and the controlled  mobilisation  of body  reserves  during  winter  when  feed  costs  
are high.
Pre-partum  nutrition
Frequendy  many producers  are more concerned  with the effects  of pre­
calving  nutrition  on calf weight  and ease of calving  rather than on other  
reproductive  parameters.  While  the conceptus  imposes  huge nutritional  de­
mands  on the cow particularly  during  the last trimester  of gestation,  it appears  
that maternal  system  will sacrifice  body  reserves  to meet  this demand.  There ­
fore, birth weight  of the calf  will be only slightly  reduced  under  severe  nutrient  
restriction.  In late pregnancy  the cow will,  in essence,  lose weight  proportional  
to the weight  gain of the calf. However,  severe  under  nutrition  during  late 
gestation  has implications  for calf vigour,  survival  and growth  performance.  
However,  energy  restriction  in late pregnancy  results  in cows  calving  in a thin 
body condition.  A significant  relationship  has been shown  between  body  
condition  at calving  and subsequent  pregnancy  rate  (Table  1). Only  72%  of cows  
that were  thin at calving  were  pre^ant  after  an 80 day breeding  period  compared  
with 89% and 90% for cows in moderate  and good condition  at calving,  
respectively . TTiere  was,  also  a decrease  in the proportion  of cows  pregnant  early  
in the breeding  period  when  they were  thin at calving.  The main  reason  for the 
lowered pregnancy  rate in thin  cows  is the extended  interval  to first  post-partum  
oesu-us.
High levels  of feeding  in late gestation  does result  in over fat cows. Over  
fatness  directly  increases  the incidence  of calving  difficulty  (see Table  2). The

consequences  of excessive  feeding  are more pronounced  in heifers  than in 
mature cows.
For cows  in good  body condition  it is recommended  that they maintain  their  
body weight  up until caving. This means  that they are losing  some body  
condition  when  the growth  of the conceptus  is taken  into consideration.
Post-partum  nutrition
While  it is important  that cows  calve  down  in good  body  condition  the level  
of nutrition  during  lactation  does have an effect  on reproductive  performance.  
After  calving  there  is a dramatic  increase  in the nutrient  requirement  of the cow 
as well as a change  in the ranking  in which  nutrients  are utilized.  After  calving  
the priority  for nutrients  are for maintenance,  milk production  and lastly for 
reproduction.  Reproduction  will be the first function  to suffer with poor  
nutrition.  Almost  inevitably  there  is some  loss in body  condition  after  calving.  
However,  this loss should  be minimised.  Cows  calving  in a moderate  to good  
body condition  and receiving  an adequate  plane  of nutrition  post calving  will 
generally  resume  cyclicity  and can be successfully  mated  to calve  down  with 12 
months.  However,  if weight  loss after  calving  is severe,  even  cows  calving  in 
good body  condition  may not cycle  or may initiate  cyclicity  and then become  
anoestrous.  These  effects  are compounded  if cows  receive  low levels  of nutrition  
both before  and after  calving.
Nutritional  management  of suckler  cows and the use of body condition  
scores
Target  condition  score  at calving,  mating  and at weaning  are presented  in 
Table  3. For spring  calving  suckler  cows  the critical  target is condition  score  at

91
mating  which  is set at 2. This  relatively  low score  at mating  is compensated  for 
by the high  nutritive  value  of spring  grass  which  allows  the cows  to be in positive  
energy  balance  throughout  the mating  period. On the other hand the target  
condition  score  at mating  for autumn  calving  cows  is 2.5 as cows  are expected  
to rebreed  while  mobilising  some  body  reserves.
Breeding  management  of heifers  and first calvers
The  extended  calving  season  common  in many  suckler  herds  is often  the  result  
of  poor  management  of heifers  and first  calvers.  Date  of first  calving  determines  
calving  date in subsequent  years  as well as future  calving  spread  for the herd.  
Once  established,  it is difficult  to alter  calving  pattern.  Ensuring  that heifers  
calve  compactly  2-3 weeks  before  the main  herd  wiU,  over  a 5-6  year  period,  help 
to reduce  the calving  spread  of the herd. Because  first calvers  have a longer  
interval  to resumption  of cyclicity  than older  cows,  calving  them  in advance  of 
the main  herd  ensures  that  a higher  proportion  are cyclic  at the start  of the mating  
period.  Furthermore,  the longer  the calving  to service  interval  the higher  will be 
the conception  rates  following  mating.  The mating  period  for heifers  should  be 
strictly  confined  to 6 weeks.  Late  calving  heifers  will  be late  calving  cows  in later 
years. While  calved  heifers  have lower  maintenance  requirements  and lower  
milk production  than mature  cows, they nevertheless,  have an additional  
nutritional  requirement  for maternal  growth.  This  results  in a greater  overall  feed 
requirement  compared  to mature  cows. If additional  feed  is not  provided  to meet  
this extra  demand,  the calved  heifer  will draw  upon her body  reserves,  in other  
words  essentially  on her body condition.  Nature  dictates  that first nutritional  
priority  be given  to nourishing  the calf. Consequently,  growth  of the young  cow 
may be slowed  or stopped  during  this period. More  seriously,  repr^uction  is 
delayed  if nutrition  is inadequate.  The net result  is an increased  calving  interval  
and higher  culling  rates for barrenness.
To minimise  rebreeding  problems  in first  calvers  it is critical  that  replacement  
heifers  should  calve  2 to 3 weeks  in advance  of the main  herd. Also  they  are well 
grown  at the time  of mating(in  excess  of 330 kg at 15 months)  and  calving  (500-1-  
kg). This  will,  also  ensure,  that  the replacement  heifers  are regularly  cycUc  at 15 
months . Pregnancy  rates  are lower  at the pubertal  and  first  post  pubertal  heat  than 
at subsequent  heats. Heifers  should  always  be mated  to an easy calving  sire.
Effect  of heterosis  on fertility  in suckler  cows
It is well recognised  that crossbreeds  are superior  to purebreds  as suckler  
cows.  This  phenomenon,  known  as hybrid  vigour  or heterosis,  is one  of the main  
reasons  for using  crossbred  suckler  cows. Crossbred  cows survive  and grow  
better,  and  attain  puberty  at an earlier  age, have  shorter  calving  to first  ovulation  
intervals,  have higher  conception  rates and their offspring  survive  and grow  
better. The cumulative  advantage  over  purebreds  is estimated  to be about  23% 
in calf weaning  weight  per cow exposed  to mating.  To maximise  heterosis  the 
crossbred  cow should  in turn be crossed  with a sire of a third  breed,  preferably  
a continental  breed  sire. The  other  reason  for using  crossbred  cows  for suckling  
is breed  complementarity.  This  consists  of the combining  economically  impor ­
tant traits  from  different  breeds  within  the crossbred  cow. For  example,  the milk
92
prcxluction  characteristics  of the Friesian  breed is combined  with the beef 
characteristics  of the Hereford  in the Hereford  X Friesian  suckler  cow. Recent  
studies  at Grange  recorded  small  differences  between  Hereford  X Friesian  and 
Limousin  X Friesian  genotypes  regarding  their suitability  as suckler  cows  but 
with whatever  differences  that  exist  being  in favour  of the Limousin  X Friesian.
Choice  of terminal  sire breed
Because  the calf is the only saleable  output  from the suckler  cow weaning  
weight  is a major  determinant  of profitability.  Sire  breeds  have  a much  greater  
effect  on weaning  weight  than cow breeds. However,  the advantage  of faster  
growth  rates  and heavier  weaning  weights,  must  be offset  by the increased  birth  
weight  which  increases  the incidence  of difficult  calvings  and calf mortality.  
Also,  gestation  length  is about  one week  longer  in cows mated  to continental  
sires. The larger  continental  breeds,  Charolais,  Simmental  and Blonde  d'Aqui ­
taine  should  be used  on the mature  cows. Heifers  should  always  be mated  by an 
easy calving  bull. For heifers  calving  at two years  of age this invariably  means  
either  a Hereford  or Aberdeen  Angus  bull. An easy  calving  Limousin  bull could  
be used on two year old heifers  or in situations  where  calving  management  is 
good. All bulls,  however,  are capable  of giving  rise to some  degree  of calving  
difficulty.
Bull fertility
In suckler  herds  the primary  functions  of a bull are to get cows  pregnant  and 
to produce  live healthy  calves,  which have  high  growth  potential,  with minimal  
calving  difficulty.  In order  to get cows  pregnant  a bull must  have  sufficient  sex 
drive  (libido)  to seek  out cows  in heat,  be capable  of producing  ample  amounts  
of viable semen,  be structurally  sound  and physically  fit to deposit  the semen  to 
enable  conception.
Frequently  the role of the bull in herd reproductive  performance  of the herd 
is taken for  granted.  The fertility  of the bull is several  times  more  important  than 
that of individual  cows. A bull is usually  expected  to successfuly  cover  up to 45 
cows  while  each  cow  is expected  to wean  only  one  calf  each  year. Subfertile  bulls  
cause  extended  calving  seasons,  low calf  crops  and consequently  low weaning  
weights.  Therefore,  on farms  using  natural  service,  bull fertility  has a major  
impact  on profitability.  Unfortunatley,  a bull's  infertility  or subfertility  is not 
usually  discovered  until  at least  one repeat  interval  has elapsed  after  joining  the 
herd. In Ireland  there  is no information  on fertility  of bulls in natural  service.  
However, Scottish  workers  (Lowman  et a, 1980)  reported  that 3-5%  of bulls  in 
natural service  were  completley  infertile,  while  a further  30% were  classified  as 
unsatisfactory  in terms  of semen  quality,  penile  abnormalities,  and libido.
A bull may not remain  fertile  for all of its working  life or indeed  throughout  
a single  mating  season.  For  example,  a bull that  was  ill and that had a raised  body  
temperature  for a number  of days will be infertile  for a period. However  this 
pieriod  of infertility  will not occur  immediatley  following  the illness  but 50 to 60 
days later. Similarly,  injury  to the penis,  sheath  or prepuce  while  not affecting  
mounting  behaviour,  can prevent  mating. Therefore,  producers  should  con­
stantly  monitor  bull performance.
93
In an attempt  to reduce  the extent  of bull infertility  a breeding  soundness  
examination  was developed  in the United  States. This involves  a complete  
physical  examinationTr^tal  examination,  scrotal  circumference  measurement,  
semen  collection  and evaluation.  Scrotal  circumference  measurements  are 
accurate  predictors  of sperm output Bulls with large testes produce  more  
spermatozoa.  Scrotal  circumference  in young  bulls  is, also,  positively  correlated  
with fertility  traits. As scrotal  circumference  increases  sperm motility  and 
percentage  normal  sperm  also increase.  The overall  fertility  classificaiton  of a 
bull is based  on the lowest  classification  obtained  on any  part  of the examination.  
While  this gives  a good  prediction  of a bull's  fertility  there  are other  components  
which  are equally  important.  Bull libido  is vital and has litUe  or no association  
with other fertility  traits, such as semen quality  or scrotal  circumference.  
Difference  in libido  test scores  of individual  bulls have been associated  with 
significant  differences  in actual  pregnancy  rate.
Because  of the variability  in fertility  between  bulls  it is difficult  to give  precise  
guidelines  regarding  the maximum  number  or cows  that should  be allotted  to a 
bull. The usual  recommendations  are 20 to 30 cows  for young  bulls and 40 to 
50 cows  for mature  bulls.
While  complete  breeding  soundness  examinations  of bulls  are not carried  out 
in Ireland,  nevertheless,  a veterinary  examination  of a bull combined  with a 
semen  evaluation  taken  one month  before  the start  of the mating  period  will help 
to identify  the majority  of infertile  bulls.
Use of A.L in suckler  herds
Between  30 and 40% of suckler  cows in Ireland  are bred by artificial  
insemination.  Most  of these  cows  are located  in the smaller  herds  where  close  
supervision  for heat detection  is possible  and where  herd size is too small  to 
justify  the purchase  of a bull for natural  service.
Advantages  of using  A. I.
Artificial  insemination  offers  a wide  range  of genetically  superior  sires  which  
are performance  and/or  progeny  tested  for growth  rate,  conformation,  fatness,  as 
well  as surveyed  for ease  of calving.  The range  of breeds  and sires  within  breeds  
allows  producers  to select  a particular  bull for an individual  cow rather  than 
having  all cows  mated  by one bull in the case  of natural  service.  In small  herds  
the use of artificial  insemination  eliminates  the need  for keeping  a bull while  in 
larger  herds  it reduces  the number  of bulls  required.
Disadvantages of using A.I.
The main disadvantage  of using A.I. is that its success  is almost  totally  
dependentontheefficiencyofheatdetection  achieved.  Research  has shown  that 
heat detection  efficiency  is usually  the weakest  link in reproductive  manage ­
ment. Heat  detection  is time  consuming  and requires  total commitment  for the 
duration  of the breeding  period.
To use A. I. successfully  a number  of critical  management  points  must be 
understood  and followed,  particularly  in relation  to the occurrence,  duration  and 
behaviourial  signs  of heat.
94
Signs  of heat
1. Standing  to be mounted  by herd  mate  or bull: This  is the most  definite  sign.
2. Discharge  of clear mucus: this originates  in the uterus  and is a good  
indication  of imminent  heat.
3. Restlessness  and mounting  behaviour:  Signs of restlessness  are often  
characteristic  of individual  cows  that are either  approaching  or are in heat.
4. Swelling  of vulva: Hormonal  changes  associated  with heat cause an 
increased blood  supply  to the reproductive  organs  which  in turn cause  swelling  
and reddening  of the vulva.
5. Hair  loss and dirt marks:  The hair on the tail head is usually  removed  by 
continuous  mounting  by herd mates  and the skin on either  side of the tail head  
is often  scarred  and dirty.
Duration  and intensity  of heat
It has generally  been accepted  that heat lasts for about  18 hours,  but recent  
studies  at Moorepark  with Spring  grazing  dairy  cows  indicate  that while  some  
cows  have  a standing  heat  period  of up to 30 hours,  the average  duration  is only 
9 hours.  Also,  over  one third  of all heat  periods  were  less than  6 hours  in duration  
and breaks  in standing  behaviour  are common.  It is likely  that  the duration  of heat 
is of similar  length  in suckler  cows. However,  the intensity  of heat  behaviour  is 
less in suckler  cows  due to the suckling  stimulus  and the physical  presence  of the 
calf. This lower  intensity  of behaviour  makes  heat detection  more  difficult.
Heat  detection  accuracy.
Failure  to observe  and record heat  is one of the major  factors  reducing  repro ­
ductive  efficiency  in A. I. programmes.  Studies  from many  countries  indicate  
that farmers  frequently  achieve  a heat  detection  rate of 60 to 70% and that up to 
20%  of cows  submitted  for insemination  are not in fact in heat. Careful  checking  
in the early  morning  and late evening  will detect  at least 70% of cows  in heat;  
three further  checks  during  the day are required  to detect  90% of cows  in heat. 
The best time to observe  cows  is when  they are at rest. Sometimes,  judgement  
has to be made  on a combination  of and behavioural  patterns  rather  than on an 
observed  standing  behaviour  and consequently  it is important  to understand  and 
recognise  the signs  of heat.
Timing  of insemination
In the cow  ovulation  occurs  at about  30 hours  after  onset  of standing  heat  and 
is not influenced  by duration  of heat. Because  the viable  life of the ovum  is less 
than 12 hours,  and that  of the sperm  24 to 36 hours,  correct  timing  of insemination  
is important.  The optimum  time to inseminate  is during  the second  half of the 
heat period  and for a few hours after the end of heat. The best practical  
recommendation  is that cows first observed  in standing  heat in the morning  
should  be inseminated  that evening,  while  cows first observed  standing  in the 
evening  should  be inseminated  the following  morning.  Correct  timing  of 
insemination  is critical  if bulls  of below  average  fertility  are being  used.

Fertility  - Artificial  insemination  versus  natural  service
Artificial  insemination  is often  criticised  on the gounds  that  pregnancy  rate  is 
lower  tlmn following  natural  service.  Apparent  improvement  in pregnancy  rate 
often  arises  following  the introduction  of a bull. This  apparent  improvement  is 
likely  to be due to cows  now being  mated  at a longer  post-partum  interval,  and 
or bemuse  inaccuracies  in heat detection  are now eliminated.  Where  heat 
detection  is accurate,  and when  insemination  is timed  and carried  out correctly,  
pregnancy  rate is similar  following  A. I. or natural  service.
The combined  effect of heat detection  and pregnancy  rates on calving  
spread
Accurate  heat detection  and correct  timing  of insemination  will result  in an 
overall  herd  pregnancy  rate of 60% to each insemination.  Under  good  manage ­
ment,  a conception  rate of 70% will be achieved  over  the first  four  weeks  of the 
breeding  season.  During  this first month  of breeding,  most  cows  presented  for 
insemination  are calved  for about  two months  or more  and are inseminated  at 
their ^ond  or third heat. Conception  rate falls during  the second  month  of 
breeding  because  a higher  proportion  of cows  presented  are often  at the first  or 
^ond  heat and have not had sufficient  time for the completion  of uterine  
involution  and the re-establishment  of normal  cyclicity.
If the intensive  heat  checking  required  throughout  the season  to achieve  good  
results  with  A. 1. is difficult  to implement,  a combination  of a shortened  period  
(4 weeks)  of heat  detection,  followed  by the introduciton  of a bull is a successful  
alternative  where  herd  size  allows.  This will combine  the use of A. I. on the early  
calving  and more  fertile  cows  and allow  the later  calving  and repeat  cows  to be 
bred by a bull. This  strategy  will also  help  to ensure  a compact  calving  pattern.  
While  accurate  heat  detection  is central  to a high  level  of reproductive  perform ­
ance,  it is the combination  of heat  detection  and conception  rate that  determines  
the compactness  of otherwise  of the calving  pattern.  (Table  4).

When  heat detection  and conception  rates  are high,  most  cows  calve  within  
a 12-week pieriod. Otherwise,  the breeding  season  and subsequent  calving
96
season must be extended  in order to get an acceptable  proportion  of the 
herd in calf.
Techniques  for improving  heat  detection  efficiency
Many  attempts,  based  on the cow's  overt  oestrous  behaviour  or on phsysiol-  
ogical  changes  associated  with  oestrus,  have  been  made  that would  both  reduce  
the labour  and increase  the efficiency  of heat  detection.  However,  to-date  there  
have  been  few developments  which  are practical  at farm  level  with the possible  
exception  of tail-painting  or the use of vasectomized  teaser  bulls.
Tail-painting
In dairy  cows  tail-painting  has proved  to be a useful  aid to heat detection.  
However,  its usefulness  in suckler  cows  is more  variable,  primarily  due to the 
lower  intensity  of behaviourial  heat  in suckler  cows,  resulting  in less mounting  
activity  and therefore  less complete  removal  of the paint. The paint  is applied  
as a strip of emulsion  paint  5-8 cm wide  and 20-25  cm long from the tail head  
forward.  When  a cow is mounted  a number  of times  this strip  of paint  is either  
partially  or totally  removed  by the mounting  animals.  The  problem  with  suckler  
cows is that the intensity  of mounting  activity  is often low and consequently  
removal  of the strip  of paint  is incomplete.  The paint  needs  to be applied  every  
7 to 10 days to a clipped  and brushed  tail-head  and under  dry conditions.
Teaser  bulls
There  are several  methods  of surgical  altering  bulls to render  them either  
sterile  or unable  to successfully  mate but capable  of mounting.  The most  
common  is vasectomy  whereby  a part of the vas deferens  is removed.  This 
procedure  does not affect  their  libido  or ability  to mate. However,  it should  be 
carried  out 2-3 months  prior to the mating  season  to allow the bull time to 
recover.  The  bull may  then  be fitted  with  a chin-ball  marker  device.  The  marker  
device  involves  a paint reservoir  attached  to a halter  that holds it under  the 
animal's  chin. A b^l on the lower  side  of this reservoir  releases  a marking  paint  
when compressed.  When  the teaser  mounts  a female  in heat his chin will strike  
her back,  releasing  the paint  and marking  the animal.  Cows  are checked  twice  
daily for paint  marks  in conjuction  with other  signs  of heat. The reservoir  is 
refilled  at fortnightly  intervals.  Such  a bull can prove  useful  in detecting  heat 
particularly  in suckler  cows  where  the intensity  of heat is often  low. However,  
like intact  bulls  considerable  variation  in hbido,  also,  exists  among  teaser  bulls.  
Bulls  with  a high  libido  generally  prove  to be the more  efficient  at detecting  cows  
in heat. Teaser  bulls  require  the same  management  as entire  bulls.
Reducing  the suckling  stimulus
While  the nutrient  requirements  to maintain  lactation  are large,  this effect  is 
further compounded  by the suckling  stimulus  which delays  the resumption  of 
postpartum  cyclicity.  Removing  a portion  of the suckling  stimulus,  by allowing  
calves  to suckle  only once or twice  daily,  will advance  the onset  of cyclicity.  
Where  the use of this technique  is planned  commencement  of separation  should
97
begin  at 35 days  post  calving  and should  continue  until the cow is inseminated.  
An added  bonus  of this technique  is that it greatly  facilitates  heat detection  
because  cows  are penned  twice  daily.  Furthermore,  removal  of the calf  increases  
the intensity  of oestrous  behaviour  thus facilitating  easier  identificaiton  of cows  
in heat. Once  or twice  daily  suckling  seems  to have  no adverse  effect  on cow or 
calf  health  or on calf  weaning  weight  This  strategy  has applications  in situations  
where  calves  are multiple  suckled,  in first  calving  cows  which  generally  have  a 
longer  post  partum  interval,  in late calving  cows,  or in cows  where  the suckling  
effect  of the calf is likely  to be compounded  by poor pre and or post-partum  
nutrition.  Complete  calf removal  for a period of 48 hours has also been  
frequently  used  but with more  variable  results.
Oestrous  synchronization
Oesnous  synchronisation  involves  gaining  control,  not simply  over  the time 
of heat onset,  but, more  importantly  over time of ovulation.  In the early  post­
partum  period,  cyclical  activity  is often not yet resumed  and synchronisation  
here effectively  means  inducing  oestrus  and ovulation.  Because  progesterone,  
secreted  by the corpus  luteum,  is the major  hormone  controlling  the length  of the 
oestrous  cycle,  gaining  control  over  the lifespan  of the corpus  luteum  is the basis  
for controlling  or synchronising  the cycle. There  are two methods  of control  
commercially  available.
1. Prostaglandin  treatment
This  is based  on theadministration  of either  natural  or synthetic  prostaglandin,  
which  induces  rapid  regression  of the functional  corpus  luteum.  Because  only 
animals  with a functional  corpus  luteum  (between  days  5 to 15 of the cycle)  will 
respond  a single  adminisbation  will induce  heat in only about  50% of treated  
females.  However,  by administering  prostaglandin  twice,  at a 12 day interval,  
most  of the animals  will  have  a functional  corpus  luteum  at the time  of the second  
injection  and 80 to 90%  will show  a synchronised  heat  on days  3 and 4 following  
the second  administration.  All beated  animals  may be checked  for heat and 
inseminated  on the basis  of an observed  heat. Alternatively,  all animals  may be 
inseminated  at 72 and again  at 96 hours  after  the second  injection.  The overall  
pregnancy  rate is similar  for both insemination  regimens.
2. Short-term  progestagen  treatment
This is based  on the adminisbation  of oesbogen,  which  causes  regression  of 
recently  formed  corpora  lutea  and endogenous  progesterone  to decline.  At the 
same time natural  progesterone  is administered  exogenously  to simulate  the 
function  of the corpus  luteum. All animals  are then under the influence  of 
progesterone  in a simulated  luteal  phase.  Following  removal  of the progesterone  
all animals  enter the follicular  phase  together  giving  a synchronised  heat and 
ovulation  response.  The above  treatment  is commercially  available  as proges ­
terone  releasing  inbavaginal  devices  PRIDs.  For the standard  synchronisation  
beatment  the PRID  is inserted  for 12 days  and the cows  are inseminated  twice  
at 48 and again  at 72 hours  following  PRID  removal.  Alternatively,  as with
98
prostaglandin  treatment,  animals  may be checked  for heat  and inseminated  on 
the basis of an observed  heat. The overall  pregnancy  rate is similar  for both 
insemination  regimens.  More  recently  it has been  demonstrated  that  by admini ­
stering  prostaglandin  24 hours  before  PRID  removal  that the duration  of the 
treatment  period  can be reduced  from 12 days to 7 to 9 days. Furthermore,  the 
heat  response  is more  synchronised  thus  leading  to higher  pregnancy  rates  to the 
fixed  time insemination.
Choice  of synchronization  method
For cyclic  heifers,  the double  prostaglandin  regimen  is probably  the most  
convenient  and  cost  effective  method.  For  suckler  cows  the use of prostaglandin  
is not recommended  because  a high proportion  of cows would  not have a 
functional  corpus  luteum  at the time  of synchronization  and,  therefore,  would  not 
respond.  While  PRIDs  are effective  in synchronising  heat  in cyclic  animals,  their  
effectiveness  for inducing  heat in non-cyclic  post-partum  cows is somewhat  
variable.  This variability  is related  to the interval  post-partum  and the depth  of 
anoestrum.  A combined  progestagen  and gonadotrophin  (PMSG)  treatment  has 
been developed  at Belclare,  particularly  for use in non-cyclic  beef  cows. This 
increases  both the  proportion  of cows  responding  and the ovulation  rate. The  net 
effect  is to increase  the pregnancy  rate by a further  10 to 15% and the twinning  
rate from 2% to 10%.

Lamb  Growth  Rate on Pasture
E. J. GRENNAN
Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
In the spring  lambing  flock,  grass  provides  most  of the feed  requirements  of 
ewes  and lambs  after  lambing  with  little  or no concentrates  being  fed unless  grass  
supply  is deemed  to be very  scarce.  Where  grass  supply  is adequate,  lamb  growth  
rate in April  and May  is generally  satisfactory  but tends  to decline  in June  when  
lambs  are at the 10 to 14 week  age. Lamb  growth  rate post-weaning  is known  
to vary widely  depending  on the type  of the pasture  on offer. The objective  of 
grazing  management  is to provide  grass in sufficient  quantity  and quality  to 
promote  high growth  rate consistent  with good  stocking  rate.
Pasture  quantity
The quantity  of grass on offer to grazing  animals  has been measured  in 
different  ways.  Stocking  rate  is the method  commonly  used  to match  feed  supply  
and demand  but this method  lacks  any definition  of the actual  supply  of grass  on 
offer  at any particular  time. The pasture  allowance  method  is popular  in New  
Zealand.  This involves  measuring  the yield of herbage  in a paddock  before  
grazing  and  offering  a precise  weight  of  grass  dry matter  per sheep  per  day. Fresh  
herbage  is offered  daily  or less frequently.  The  residual  dry matter  method  has 
been  used  in rotational  grazing  to decide  when  stock  should  be moved  to the next 
paddock.  This  involves  measuring  the yield  of herbage  remaining  after  grazing  
a paddock.
In recent  years  the pasture  height  method  has become  popular  as a way of 
judging  the suitability  of pasture  for both  set stocking  and rotational  grazing . It 
has the advantage  at farm level  that no yield  measurement  is required  and with  
a little  experience  pasture  height  can be accurately  gauged  by eye. Pasture  height  
and herbage  allowance  methods  have  been used in grazing  studies  at Belclare.
Lamb  growth;  birth  to weaning
A high growth  rate in lambs  from birth to weaning  is desirable,  leading  to 
heavier  weaning  weights  and earlier  drafting  of lambs thereby  reducing  the 
dependence  on selling  in the peak  months  of  July  to September.  Trials  at Belclare  
over two years examined  some factors  that may affect  lamb growth  rate on 
pasture.
(a) pasture  type: Three  pastures  were compared;  old permanent  pasture  that 
was grazed  by sheep  only  for many  years  (old  pasture);  A reseeded  pasture,  one 
year  old and  grazed  by sheep  in the sowing  year  (new  pasture):  and  old  permanent  
pasture  grazed  by cattle  only in previous  years  (cattle  pasture).
(b) pasture  height:  Each  pasture  was set stocked  from  lambing  to weaning  and 
grazed  at each  of three  heights,  low (3 to 4 cm),  medium  (5 to 6 cm) and high  (8 
to 9 cm).
100
(c) dosing:  Two dosing  frequencies  were  compared:  In one replicate,  lambs  
were  dosed  at 5 and 10 weeks  while  the second  replicate  received  extra  doses  at 
7 /^and  12 weeks.  Mean  lambing  date was March  20 and ewes  and lambs  were  
put  out to pasture  when  lambs  were  a few  days  old. The  pastures  were  rested  over  
winter  and received  45 units of nitrogen  jter acre in February  for early  grass.  
There  were 18 groups  with  9 ewes  and 14 to 15 lambs  per group.  No meals  were  
fed after  lambing.  After  turn-out  the aim was to achieve  target  heights  as soon  
as possible.  Heights  were  maintained  by using  different  size  paddocks  (approx.  
V2, V3 or 1 ha per group),  adjusting  padd^k  sizes  using  moveable  electric  fences,  
occasional  use of non-experimental  dry sheep,  and topping  of pastures  as 
required.
Results
Pasture  type: Lamb  growth  rate to weaning  was similar  on old and reseeded  
sheep  pasture  when  grazed  at the same  height  (Table  1). This  confirms  that  good  
growth  rates can be sustained  on permanent  pasture  under intensive  sheep  
grazing.
However,  reseeded  pasture  may carry extra stock if grass production  is 
higher.  Growth  rates  on cattle  pasture  were  higher  than  on the other  two  pastures.  
The advantage  to cattle  pasture  was greatest  in the first year  of sheep  grazing^ 
amounting  to about  10 percent  better  ^owth  rate  and  about  3 kg heavier  weaning  
weight  This  higher  weaning  weight  is of considerable  advantage  as it increases  
the number  of lambs  fit for drafting  at weaning.  It is interesting  that  growth  rate 
on the 3 pastures  was  fairly  similar  up to 5 weeks.  The  advantage  to cattle  pasture  
was greatest  from  5 to 10 weeks,  and to a lesser  extent  from 10tol4weeks.  The 
reason  for the better  performance  on catUe  pasture  is not fully  clear,  but is likely  
to be due m part at least to the lower worm burden  on the cattle pasture.  
Parasitological  studies  involving  herbage  larval  counts,  faecal  egg counts,  tracer  
sheep and examination  of lambs  sent to the factory  indicated  lower  worm  
burdens  on the cattle  pasture  in the first year.
The more  intensive  dosing  of lambs  (4 doses)  was  no better  than the standard  
dosing  (2 doses)  even on pasture  grazed  by sheep  every  year.
The  fact that there  was no difference  between  pastures  in the 0 to 5 week  stage  
may not be surprising  as lambs  consume  litUe  grass  at that  age. This fact  can be 
exploited  in a clean-grazing  situation  where  the aim would  be to have clean  
grazmg  available  from 5 weeks  of age (about  mid-April)  with less concern  for 
the 0 to 5 week  stage.
Pasture  height:  Lamb  growth  rate increased  with increasing  pasture  height  on 
all pastures  (Table  2). The  response  to increasing  height  was most  evident  up to 
10 weeks  of age (end  of May),  From  10 to 14 weeks  (June)  the effect  of pasture  
height  was less clear-cut,  with a significant  response  only in year  2. In general  
the medium  pasture  height  of about  6 cm gave  near  maximum  (97%)  growth  rate 
and weaning weight.  Giving  pasture  of less than 4 cm restricted  lamb  growth  
rate to about  89% of their  potential.  However,  grazing  at a height  of about  9 cm 
only improved  growth  rates by 3 to 4 % compared  with the 6 cm and implied
101
using  a considerably  lower  stocking  rate.
The period  after  turn out in spring  is a time  when  grass  is often  scarce  and the 
question  arises as to whether  supplementary  feeding  is needed. While  no 
concentrates  were  fed in this experiment,  they are not likely  to be necessary  if 
pasture  is 5 to 6 cm high but may  be required  where  the height  is 3 to 4 cm.
Lamb  growth  rate from 10 to 14 weeks  (June)  was lower  than from 0 to 10 
weeks  on all pastures  and at all heights.  This  coincides  with the time  when  ewe 
milk  supply  is low and pastures  are getting  stemmy  if under-grazed  in May. In 
this trial  pasture  quantity  and  quality  may  have  affected  growth  rates  in June.  The 
short  grass  was leafy  but scarce  while  the tall grass  was plentiful  but stemmy.  
Lax grazing  (9cm)  in April-May  was no disadvantage  while  grass  was leafy  but 
it leads to a very stemmy  pasture  in June. Ideally  the pasture  should  be 
maintained  at about  6 cms  pre-weaning.  If grass  is higher  in May,  a tight  grazing  
(down  to 3 to 4 cm)  at the end  of May  would  help  to maintain  the pasture  in a leafy  
state in June.
The average  weaning  weights  of lambs  for 2 years  on diffemet  pastures  and 
at different  heights  are shown  in Table  3. Normal  14 week  weaning  weight  in 
similar  flocks  would  be 31 to 32 kg. The  results  show  the extent  to which  weights  
may be increased  or decreased  depending  on the pasture  type and height.

Lamb  growth  post-weaning
The effect  of pasture  height  and herbage  allowance  on the liveweight  gain  of 
weaned  lambs  was measured  over  a number  of years.
Pasture  height-set  stocking:  Weaned  lambs  were set-stocked  on old perma ­
nent  sheep  pasture  maintained  at different  heights.  Pastures  contained  very  little  
clover.  Lambs  were  dosed  and treated  with  cobalt  every  3 weeks.  Table  4 shows  
the pasture  heights  and  weight  gains  achieved.  It is clear  that  highest  growth  rates  
were obtained  on pastures  grazed  at 8 to 9 cm in the July to September  period.  
Growth  rates  were  lower  in October/November  but there  was a similar  response  
to increasing  pasture  height.
Pasture  height  - rotational  grazing  : In these experiments  lambs were  
rotationally  grazed  on permanent  or reseeded  pastures  of low clover  content.

♦Pre-grazing  heights  were 8 to 10 cm.
103
They  were  generally  8 to 10 cm high  before  grazing  and grazed  down  to heights  
of about  4,5 or 6 cm. Results  show  that  highest  growth  rates  were  obtmned  with 
the highest  herbage  allowances  (Table  5). Growth  rates  also declined  in the late 
autumn  period.  The data  reflect  the wide  range  in growth  rates  that  are obtained  
depending  on the supply  of grass  and the time  of year. The  post-grazing  heights  
indicate  that  highest  gains  were  obtained  where  lambs  did  not  have  to graze  down  
below  about  6 cm on these  pastures.
It is evident  from these  results  that the optimum  pasture  height  was higher  
than  that  required  in spring.  This  is partly  a reflection  of the nature  of the pasture  
at different  times  of the year. In spring  the pasture  is mostly  green  leaf  and lambs  
can perform  well  on short  grass. In summer  and autumn,  on aftermath  or grazed  
pasture,  the lower  layer  of the sward  contains  more  stem  ^d dead  leaf  and lamb  
growth  rate is reduced  if they are forced  to graze  down  into this layer.
Clover : White  clover  is a valuable  component  of the sheep  pastime.  Intake  
and digestibility  are generally  higher  for all-grass  pastures,  and this is reflected  
in higher  lamb  growth  rates  - up to 22 g per day in some  trials.
Conclusions
From  turn-out  until  weaning  a pasture  height  of about  6 cm was  suitable  under  
set-stocking.  Old and reseeded  pastures  gave similar  growth  rates in lambs.  
Growth  rate was about  10% better  on a cattle  pasture  not previously  grazed  by 
sheep. A pasture  height  of 8 to 9 cm was best for weaned  lambs  under  set 
stocking,  or grazing  down  to about  6 cm for rotational  grazing.

Exploiting  the Ram Effect  for Early  
Breeding  : Effects  of Ewe  Age and Breed
J. P. HANRAHAN  and E. G. OTIIORDAN  
Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam,  Co. Galway
Under  appropriate  conditions  anestrous  ewes  can be stimulated  to ovulate  by 
the introduction  of rams  following  a period  of isolation  from  males  (Pearce  and 
Oldham,  1984).  If such  ewes  are pretreated  with  a progesterone,  oestrus  will  also 
be induced  following  ram introduction.  Thus a synchronised  mating  can be 
induced  in advance  of the onset  of the normal  breeding  season  without  the use 
of an exogenous  gonadotrophin  such as PMSG.  There  is a broad similanty  
between  the events  preceding  puberty  in ewe  lambs  and the onset  of the breeding  
season  in ewes  and there is some  evidence  that ewe lambs  can respond  to the 
introduction  of rams in the same  way as adult  ewes (Drymundsson  and Lees,  
1972).
Two experiments  were conducted  to examine  the possible  role of the ram 
effect  in advancing  the date  of mating  in ewes  and in ewe lambs.  The objective  
of the study  with adult  ewes  was to test the utility  of the ram effect  for inducing  
a synchronised  mating  in ewes  about  5 weeeks  in advance  of the exp)ected  date 
of onset  of the breeding  season. The study with ewe lambs  was designed  to 
examine  the susceptibility  of this age group  to the ram effect  and how this is 
influenced  by the time  of ram introduction  relative  to expected  date  of puberty.
Materials  and Methods
Experiment  1: The adult  ewes  used in this experiment  were  from  either  the 
Belclare  or Finn-Dorset  breeds.  The  onset  of the breeding  season  is known  to be 
earlier  in Finn-Dorset  ewes  (August  25th)  than in the Belclare  breed  (September  
15th (Hanrahan,  1986).  The  experiment  was designed  to compare  the responses  
of these  two breeds  to ram introduction  in mid-August  and also to compare  the 
performance  of Belclare  ewes  given  PMSG  with those  not given  PMSG.  All 
ewes had MAP  spenges  inserted  on August  5th and these were removed  on 
August  16th at which  time fertile  rams  were  introduced.  The ram to ewe ratio  
was 1:9. Half  of the Belclare  ewes  were  given  750 i.u. PMSG  at spwnge  removal.  
Matings  were  recorded  daily and all ewes  were  subjected  to laparoscopy  on day 
9 following  ram introduction  to measure  ovulation  rate. The  rams  were  removed  
at this stage.
Experiment  2: This  study  utilised  Belclare  and Belclare  x Galway  ewe lambs  
bom in March/April.  Previous  studies  with  ewe  lambs  of these  two breed  typ)es  
had shown  that  mean  date  of first  ovulation  is between  mid-  to late-October  with 
first  oestrus  being  observed  about  3 weeks  later  in early  November  (Fitzsimons  
and Hanrahan,  1984;  Hantrahan  eta/.,  1985).  The  experiment  involved  exposing  
ewe lambs,  which  had been isolated  from contact  with rams for at least one 
month,  to fertile  rams  and recording  the ovulation  response,  by endoscopy  on 
day 6 following  ram  introduction.  Ewe  lambs  were  assigned  to one  of five  groups
105
on a within  breed  basis. Rams  were intnxiuced  to Groups  1, 2, 3 and 4 on 
September  27th, October  4th, October  11th and October  18th, respectively.  
Group  5 was kept in isolation  from rams until October  25th. Once  rams were  
introduced  to a group  they remained  with that group  until all the rams were  
withdrawn  on December  6th. TTie ewe lambs in the Control  group were  
examined  by endoscopy  on the same  day as each  of the Groups  1 to 4. Date  of 
first  oestrus  was recorded  by daily  checks  for mating  marks  and ovulation  rate 
was recorded  within  10 days  of first oestrus.
Results
Experiment  1: The performance  of ewes  in each  of the experimental  groups  
is summarised  in Table  1. All ewes  had active  corpora  lutea  at endoscopy.  The 
difference  among  the groups  was small  except  for ovulation  rate which  was 
increased  significantly  by PMSG  administration.  The differences  in litter size 
reflected  the ranking  on ovulation  rate  but it is clear  that  the PMSG  group  showed  
only  a small  gain  relative  to the controls.  The average  number  of lambs  bom  per 
ewe  joined  showed  an advantage  of 0.16 for ewes  treated  with PMSG.

Experiment  2 : The average  body  weight  of the ewe lambs  used  was 42 kg in 
October  and 44 kg at ram removal  in early  December.  The  effect  of joining  date 
on the proportion  of ewe lambs  which  responded  to ram introduction  is shown  
in Table  2. The  results  show  that  ewe  lambs  failed  to respond  on September  27th 
but there  was a clear  effect  of ram introduction  on October  4 th and October  11th.  
By October  18th ovarian  activity  had commenced  in almost  all the isolated  ewe 
lambs.  Aspects  of the subsequent  reproductive  performance  are summarised  in

♦Controls
Table 3. It is evident  that date  of first  estrus  was  effected  by the joining  s trategy  
adopted  with estrus  onset  occurring  significantly  earlier  in the group  joined  on 
October  4th than in the group first exposed  to rams one week earlier  on 
September  27 th. It is not possible  to estimate  from  this  experiment  the maximum  
advance  in date of first estrus  which  could  be obtained  by exploiting  the ram 
effect  but it is suggested  that an advance  of 2 weeks  is probable  near  the upper  
limit for the type of sheep  used in this study.
An interesting  feature  of the experiment,  which  is apparent  from  an examina ­
tion of date  of first  estrus  in the ewe lamb  which  responded  to the ram  on October  
4th and October  18th, is that they can be subdivided  into two subgroups.  One 
subgroup displayed  first  estrus  about  17 days  centered  around  23 days  post  ram 
introduction.  Out of 38 ewe  lambs  which  could  be assigned  to the first  subgroup  
(mean interval to estrus  was 17.2 days,  s.d. = 0.9),  while  14 were  assigned  to the 
second  subgroup  (mean  interval  23.2,  s.d. = 0.80). A total of 8 ewe lambs  had 
intervals  to first  estrus  which  were  inconsistent  with  these  two subgroups  (6 with 
short intervals,  1 to 11 days,  and 2 with long intervals,  28 to 36 days). These  
results  are interpreted  to mean  that  about  50%  of ewe  lambs  which  respond  to ram 
introduction  produce  normal  corpora  lutea  and  display  estrus  when  these  regress  
after about  13 to 14 days. In the other  subgroup  the corpora  lutea formed  in 
response  to ram introduction  regress  within  6 to 7 days of ram inuoduction  
followed  by a second  ovulatory  event  but without  an associated  estrus. First  
estrus  then occurs  16-17  days later.
The ewe lambs  exposed  to rams  on September  27th clearly  did not respond,  
as judged  by the incidence  of ewes  with corpora  lutea  at the endoscopy  6 days  
after ram  introduction.  However,  there  is evidence  that these  ewes  exhibited  a 
delayed  response  to rams.  Thus  the date  of first  estrus  is the same  as for the group  
first exposed  to rams on October  11. Secondly,  these ewe lambs  were re­
examined  by endoscopy  on October  12th together  with their  controls  - on that 
occasion  35% had corpora  lutea compared  with 8% of the Control  lambs
(P<0-10).  . r uThe  ovulation  rale at first  estrus  was  consistent  with  previous  results  tor these  
breeds.  There  is a suggestion  that  the ovulation  rate is lower  in ewe  lambs  which  
responded  to ram introduction  but the differences  were not significant.  The
107
conception  rate at at first estrus  averaged  70%. The average  ovulation  rate of 
1 lambs  at conception  was 1.68±0.06  and the resulting  litter  size was
1.42^.06.  The  predicted  litter  size using  ovulation  rate  and the average  embryo  
suryivd  in adult  ewes  (Hanrahan,  1982)  is 1.49. Thus  there  is no indication  of 
senously  impaired  embryo  survival  in those  ewe  lambs  which  conceived  at first 
est^s. The overall  conception  rate in this study was 89% which is quite  
satisfactory  given  the length  of the joining  period.
Conclusion
The ability  of Belclare  ewes  to respond  to ram introduction  about  5 weeks  
pnor  to the normal  date of onset  of the breeding  season  is such that they can be 
successfully  mated at this time without  the use of PMSG. The overall  
productivity  of such ewes  was only slightly  less than comparable  ewes which  
were given  750.  i.u. PMSG  and did not differ  from that of Finn-Dorset  ewes  
despite  the earlier  onset  of the breeding  season  in the latter  breed.
Ewe  lambs  can respond  to ram introduction  within  5-6 weeks  of  expected  date 
of first  estrus.  However,  the transition  between  the state  of not responding  to ram 
introduction  and responsiveness  appears  to occur  very  rapidly.  The ram effect  
can be exploited  to advance  and synchronise  first estrus  in ewe lambs  and thus 
ensure  that  parturition  is at the same  time  as the adult  ewes  in seasonal  production  
systems.

Reseeding  Grassland
N. CULLETON
Teagasc,  Johnstown  Castle,  Co. Wexford.
Grassland  occupies  some 89% of the arable  land in Ireland  and of this 
approximately 3%  is reseeded  annually  (Culleton,  1989). Many  of our perma ­
nent  pastures  have  very  poor  botanical  composition  and  Frame  and  Tilley  (1988)  
pointed out that quantity  and quality  of secondary  grass  species  are inferior  to 
Lolium  perenne.  Nonetheless,  there  is evidence  that permanent  pastures  have  
high animal  production  potential  and that the large  response  to reseeding  in the 
first harvest  year  is rapidly  lost (Wilkins,  Hopkins  and Dibb,  1987).
Why  Reseed?
The first  part  of this paper  reports  on an experiment  conducted  at Johnstown  
Castle  which  compared  old pasture  to a new reseed  under  both grazing  and 
conservation  conditions.  The botanical  composition  of the old sward  at the 
beginning  of the trial is given  in Table  1. The perennial  ryegrass  content  was 
about  3.5%.  The  soil  fertility  was  improved  and  perennial  ryegrass  cv. Vigor  was 
sown  in autumn.  Both  new and old pastures  were  rotationally  grazed  for each  
of 3 years. The results  of the grazing  trial are summarised  in Table  2.

In year  1, the old pasture  gave  75 % as m uch output  in terms  of liveweight  gain/  
ha as the new  pasture.  However,  by year  3 there  were  no significant  differences  
between  the new and the old pastures.  The ryegrass  content  in the old pasture  
increased  steadily  and by the end of year 3, ryegrass  accounted  for almost  32% 
of the sward.
The  results  from the silage  component  of the trial are given  in Table  3. In the 
first, second  and third years the old sward  produced  62%, 84%, 79% of the 
production  from the new sward.  Unlike  the grazing  sward  the yield  difference  
between  the new and old pasture  remained  for the duration  of the trial. In terms  
of digestibility,  the old pasture  was significantly  poorer  than the new pasture.  
Table  1 shows  that the botanical  composition  of the old silage  sward  at the end 
of the silage  trial did not significantly  improve  at all. This is in marked  contrast  
to the grazing  sward,  where significant  improvements  in ryegrass  content  
occurred.

The structure  of the grazing  and the silage  sward  tended  to be quite  different  
from  each other. Table  4 summarises  the relevant  data. At the end of the trial,  
97% of the grass  in the new sward  was ryegrass  under  the grazing  regime,  while  
there  was only 75%  ryegrass  in the silage  regime.  The grazing  sward  had more  
tillers/m^  than the silage  sward.  It appears  that  ryegrasses  prefer  a grazing  regime  
to a silage  cutting  regime.  Even  with  good  management  silage  swards  deteriorate  
with time.
It can be concluded  that the main  niche  for reseeding  is in the conservation,  
rather  than the grazing  areas.  Grazing  areas  should  only  be reseeded  when  there  
is no ryegrass  present,  or improvements  in fertility  in the existing  sward  have  not 
already  led to significant  improvements  in productivity.
Methodology  of reseeding
Three  aspects  of reseeding  are now discussed  :
— Autumn  reseeding
— Direct  drilling
— Slurry  seeding
Autumn  reseeding
Ploughing  and reseeding  in autumn  are becoming  progressively  more  popu ­
lar, with 4045%  of total reseeding  being  carried  out from mid August  to mid 
September.  In general,  autumn  reseeding  is a reliable  method.  Timing  of sowing  
was the subject  of a trial carried  out at Johnstown  Castle.  There  were  two dates  
of sowing,  September  3 and October  4. Seedling  emergence  and tiller counts/

m^were  monitored  in the months  after  sowing  and the results  are summarised  in 
Table 4
Some  73.6%  of the seedlings  emerged  from the early  autumn  sown  seeds,  
while  only 55.3%  emerged  from the later  sown  seeds. The numbers  of tillers  in 
mid-March  were  significantly  lower  in the  later  sown  crop  than in the early  one. 
The yield  in mid-March  was also significantly  lower. This agrees  with results  
of Culleton,  Keane  and Lemaire  (1988)  who  showed  that swards  with high  tiller  
numbers  reached  appreciate  yield levels significandy  earlier  in spring  than 
swards  with low tiller  numbers.
As shown  earlier,  silage  swards  tend  to have  lower  tiller  numbers  than  grazing  
swards  mainly  because,  for much  of the grazing  season,  tillering  is restricted  due 
to low levels  of light  reaching  the sward  base  (Garwood,  1969).  Culleton,  Keane  
and Lemaire  (1988)  piointed  out that persistency  of silage  swards  is influenced  
by tiller numbers,  in that swards  with low tiller  numbers  allow  an invasion  of 
unsown  species,  thereby  reducing  overall  persistency.  It can be concluded  that 
silage  swards  should  have  high  tiller  numbers  at the onset  of the growing  season  
and therefore,  when  reseeding  forsilage,  it is imperative  that  reseeding  be carried  
out early  in autumn,  so that tillering  can proceed  during  winter.
Generally,  fields  are ploughed  because  they are infested  with docks  and/or  
bent grasses. It is good practice  to spray these fields with Round-Up.  The 
Round-Up  kills  these  persistent  weeds  and  also  benefits  the reseed  in other  ways.  
Table  5 shows  that  spraying  before  ploughing  can help  to conserve  moisture  and 
thereby  aid establisment.  Osciella  Frit control  is also made  less difficult  by 
spraying.

Autumn  management
As already  stated,  one of the major problems  with silage swards  is the 
progressive  reduction  in tiller  numbers  over  the years.  This  leads  to weed  ingress  
and sward  deterioration.  One method  of slowing  down this deterioration  is 
through  the autumn  management  of the sward.  Table  6 summarises  the effects  
of autumn  grazing  by sheep  on the tiller  density  of the sward.

By grazing  the grass  frequently  throughout  the autumn,  light is allowed  to 
penetrate  into the base  of the sward.  This encourages  tillering  to occur. When  
the grass  is not grazed  the sward  can enter  the winter  too tall (this  has happened  
in 1988,1989  and 1990  due to mild  winters).  This  tall grass  causes  a reduction  
in light intensity  reaching  the sward  base  and tillering  is restricted.  By correct  
autumn  management  of the silage  sward  the cycle  of sward  deterioration  leading  
to ploughing  and reseeding  can be slowed  down  significantly.
Direct  drilling
In many  situations  it is not  possible  to plough.  The land  is too stoney,  the soil 
is too shallow,  or perhaps  there  is no tradition  for ploughing.  Nonetheless,  the 
botanical  composition  of many  silage  swards  in these  areas  is poor. Because  
ploughing  was  not  an option,  to date  there  has  been  no easy  method  for upgrading  
these  pastures.  The introduction  of direct  drilling  has given  the opportunity  of 
introducing  perennial  ryegrasses  into native  swards  without  ploughing.
The management  before,  during  and after  drilling  needs  to be of a very high  
standard.  Table  7 summarises  the main  points  in the management  package.
Table  7
Management  strategy  In direct  drilling
Pre-sowing — adequate  soil fertility

— gocxl soil conditions
During  sowing — anti-slug  pellets

— use of fertiliser
— Herbicides
Post sowing — tight grazing 
strategic  use of nitrogen
112
Pre-sowing  There  is little  point  in drilling  if soil fertility  is low. Ryegrass  
seed does not thrive  below  a pH of 5.8, or a phosphorus  level  of below  3 ppm.  
Drilling  is most successful  after a heavy  silage  crop has been removed.  The 
regrowth of the native  sward  after silage  is significantly  slower  than that after  
tight grazing. The sown seedlings  have a better  chance  to establish  before  
competition  from the native  swards  becomes  intense.
During  sowing Anti-slug  pellets  are essential.  It is important  to use 
vigorous  seeds.  Seeds  with  high  germinability  should  be used. L^ge  seeds  tend 
to germinate  and emerge  more  rapidly  than small seeds. Table  8 summarises  
results  on rate  of seeding  emergence  among  the differentcategories  of ryegrasses.

Herbicides  can be used for complete  kill of the native  sward. The problem  
with  this approach  is that  pest  control  in the new  sward  can be difficult.  A further  
problem  is that the row spacing  of the current  drilling  machines  is too wide  for 
single  pass  operations.  Suppression  of the native  sward  by low rates  of herbicide  
application  is a useful  technique  to reduce  competition  from native  sward  and 
allow  the seedlings  to grow. If pre-sowing  management  has been  correct,  it is 
possible  to drill successfully  without  the use of herbicides.
Post sowing It is very important  to keep  the native  sward  under  control  
while  the seedlings  are establishing.  This can be done  by high stocking  at 2-3 
week intervals.  Over  the past few years,  the main cause  of failure  has been the 
lack of adequate  grazing  post-drilling.  Stock  also have  the effect  of spreading  
the plants  across  the inter  row spaces  by trampling.
Results  of trials  carried  out at Johnstown  Castle  are summarised  in Table  9. 
It is clear that ploughing  and reseeding  in the conventional  way give the best 
results  but the direct  drilling  plots  did give  yields  that were  significantly  greater  
than the control  plots.

swards  were  carried  out at Johnstown  Castle  from 1980  to 1988.
Table 10 shows  typical  Italian  ryegrass  yields  in comparison  to perennial  
ryegrass.  In the years  immediately  after  sowing  yields  are very  high  but by year 
4-5 yields  decline  to those  of jjerennial  ryegrass.  Because  four  cuts per year  are 
necesary  to maintain  good  quality,  it is imperative  that yields  be maintained  at 
high levels

Normally,  high yields  are maintained  by ploughing  and reseeding  every  two 
to three  years. This is becoming  an expensive  opieration  and work  at Johnstown  
has been  aimed  at maintaining  high  prxxluctivity  without  ploughing  and reseed ­
ing by slurry  seeding.  In September  of each  year,  after  the last cut of silage  was 
taken,  15 kg seed/ha  were  sown  using  a fertiliser  spinner.  Cattle  slurry  at the rate 
of 35 m’/ha (3000  gal/acre)  was then spread.  When the seedlings  had established  
the sward  was grazed  lightly  and frequently  until  the land  was too wet for grazing  
in late autumn.  The results  are summarised  in Table  11.

The slurry seeding  gave significantly  higher  yields throughout  the trials.  
However,  yields  were  always  lower  than the yields  achieved  in the early  years  
of the trial. The technique  is very weather  dependent.  A drought  in the 
immediate  aftermath  of slurry  seeding  can cause  complete  failure. Table 12 
shows  that Italian  ryegrass  is a large seed and it is thus very vigorous  in the 
establishment  phase.  The sward  of Italian  ryegrass  is very  open  with  a low tiller  
density.  Thus,  it is easy  for the seed  to come  in contact  with  the soil and establish  
without  undue  interference  from the native  sward. Despite  this, the technique  
was only moderately  successful.  The chances  of success  of slurry seeding  
perennial  ryegrass  into an old {yeimanent  pasture  would  be quite  poor.

Grasses  for reseeding
Table  13 shows  the sales  of the various  types  of ryegrass  over  the past  number  
of years.  There  has been  a significant  swing  away  from  the use of early  perennial  
ryegrasses.  The  main  reasons  for this  are the poor  tillering  ability  of early  grasses  
leading  to open swards  and the consistent  steminess  in mid-season.

In general  terms, late perennials  are typical  grazing  grasses. They are 
prostrate  in growth  habit,  high  tillering,  giving  a very  dense  sward  and they  tend 
to be leafy in mid-summer.  They are also extremely  persistent.  Mid-season  
ryegrasses  are upright  and are reasonably  persistent.  They are described  as 
typical  silage  grasses.
In designating  mixtures  it is important  that the requirements  of the mixture  be 
matched  against  the characteristics  of the maturity  groups.  If silage  is required  
then the dominant  component  of the mixture  should  be made  up of mid-seasons,  
with the  minor  component  being  made  up of the late perennials,  which  fulfd  the 
function  of filling  in the base  of the sward  If the requirement  is mainly  grazing,  
late perennial  ryegrasses  should  be used  with some  mid-seasons  being  included  
to make  the mixture  a little earlier  growing  in spring.

Grazing  Management  Strategies  for 
Beef  Cattle
I. A. WRIGHT
Macaulay  Land Use Research  Institute,  Pentlandfield,  Roslin,  
Midlothian  EH25  9RF,  Scotland
One  of the key ways  of improving  the profitability  of beef  production  systems  
is to improve  the efficiency  of grassland  utilization  by good grazing  manage ­
ment. The aim of grazing  management  is to convert  pasture  resources  into 
animal  product  in the most  efficient  way  possible.  This  requires  a knowledge  of 
the way in which  animals  respond  to different  sward  conditions  and the way in 
which  swards  respond  to grazing  by animals.  Research  work  over the past 10 
years  has led to considerable  progress  in both  these  areas. The  aim of this paper  
is to outline  how this research  can be used in a practical  way to improve  the 
efficiency  of grazing  systems  for beef  cattle.
Sward  height
In general,  the height  of the surface  of the sward  is a good  indicator  of how 
much grass is present,  although  the relationship  between  sward height  and 
herbage  mass does vary with the density  of the sward. A simple  tool for 
measuring  sward  height  known  as the HTOO  swardstick  has been develojied  
(Barthram,  1986). Using  this device  30 to 50 measurements  can be taken  in a 
field relatively  quickly.
Herbage  intake  and animal  performance
Sward  height  has a large  effect  on the intake  and  performance  of cattle.  Under  
continuous  grazing  maximum  herbage  intakes  by beef  cows  are obtained  when  
the sward  height  is 9-10  cm or more  (Table  1).

Since  sward  height  affects  herbage  intake,  then not unexpectedly  there  is a 
close relationship  between  sward height  and live-weight  gain (Wright  and 
Whyte,  1989).  Figure  1 shows  the live-weight  gains  of  beef  cows  and  their  calves  
when  grazed  continuously  on swards  of different  heights.  On swards  of less than 
6 cm the cows  lost  considerable  amounts  of weight.  At higher  sward  heights  cow 
live-weight  gain  increased  and reached  a maximum  at a sward  height  of 8-10  cm . 
Beyond  that  height  the cow live-weight  gain was reduced.  Calf  live-weight  gain

showed  a very  similar  pattern  of response  reaching  a maximum  at a sward  height  
of about  10 cm. As the calves  became  older  and less dependent  on milk  and more  
dependent  on herbage,  their  growth  rates  became  more  sensitive  to sward  height,  
as indicated  by the steeper  slope of the curve for August-September,  but 
maximum  live weight  gain still occurred  at a sward  height  of 9-10  cm. Similar  
responses  have been observed  with autumn  calving  cows and their calves  
(Wright,  Whyte  and Osoro,  1990)  (Table  2).

With 14-18 month-old  cattle  a sward  height  of 4.3 cm depressed  herbage  
intake  by 21% and live-weight  gain by 40%  compared  to that on a sward  at 6.8 
cm (Wright,  Russel  and Hunter,  1986)  (Table  3).

Herbage  utilization
Grazing  management  also influences  the way in which  swards  are utilised.  
Close  grazing  leads  to a rapid  increase  in the number  of tillers  in the spring.  It 
also results in high levels of herbage  production  with the elimination  of 
reproductive  tillers  and seed  heads.  By maintaining  a leafy  sward  with  few seed 
heads  the organic  matter  digestibility  of the grazing  herbage  remains  high,  and 
on perennial  ryegrass  it can be maintained  at between  75 and 80%  for most  of the 
grazing  season.
When sward surface  height  increases  beyond  8 cm, cattle do not graze  
uniformly.  Instead  they concentrate  their grazing  on some areas, rejecting  
others.  TTiese ungrazed  areas go to seed  and the digestibility  declines  dramati ­
cally. At a sward  height  of 8 cm the sward  soon  reaches  a state  where  less than  
10% of the area is rejected,  but at 12 cm a large  proportion  of the area is rejected  
in the early  part  of the season  (Wright  and Whyte,  1989)  and the sward  becomes  
'patchy'  in appearance.  The ungrazed  patches  go to seed  and later in the season  
the cattle  are forced  to graze  this material  of poor  quality  and low digestibility  
and this is the reason  for the decline  in cow live-weight  gain at swards  in excess  
of 8 to 10 cm (Figure  1).
118
Sward  height  targets
Target  sward  heights  for beef  cattle  are given  in Table  4.

10-14
A sward  height  of 6-8 cm should  be achieved  as soon  as possible  in spring  and 
the height  should  be maintained  at no more  than 8 cm until  mid-summer  to avoid  
seed head  development  Once  the risk of seed head  development  is past,  sward  
height  can be allowed  to increase  to 10-14  cm. These  heights  will ensure  high  
levels  of grassland  utilization  and high  levels  of animal  performance.  In autumn  
it is important  to graze  swards  down  to 4 cm to avoid  'winter  kill'.
Control  of swards  height  and forage  conservation
Given  a background  of herbage  growth  rates  that  change  not only  seasonally,  
but vary  within  a season  on a week-to-week  basis  as a result  of climatic  variation  
and fertilizer  regime,  some  means  of varying  stocking  rate needs  to be found  if 
sward  height  is to be controlled.
This can be achieved  by integrating  grazing  and conservation.  Instead  of 
setting aside  a fixed  area  of grassland  for grazing  and a separate  area for fodder  
conservation,  there is a need for a flexible  approach.  If on the area initially  
allocated  to grazing  sward  heights  are too high,  then part of it can be closed  off 
for conservation.  Similarly,  if sward  heights  are too low, then an extra  area of 
grassland  can be incorporated  into the grazing  area. S uch an approach  to grazing  
management  has been tested  at the Macaulay  Land Use Research  Institute.  
Sward  heights  are maintained  by regular  adjustment  of the area available  for 
giving  at least during  the period  of conservation  (up until mid-August).  The 
striking  feature  of this approach  is the consistency  of performance  that can be 
achieved  from year to year. Table  5 shows  calf  weaning  weights  over  a three-  
year  period  when  sward  heights  were  maintained  at 7-8 cm during  the period  of 
conservation  and when  overall  stocking  rate was 2.5 cows/ha.  This  stability  over 
years  was achieved  in years  which  were  considered  to be both 'good'  and 'bad' 
grazing  seasons,  and yet the variation  is largely  removed  from individual  animal  
performance  and output.
Table  5

By controlling  sward  height  in this way,  rather  than setting  aside  a fixed  area 
for forage  conservation,  there  will be some  variation  in the area cut and thus in 
winter  fodder  production.  However  the results  in Table  5 indicate  that over a 
three  year  period  the total  area  cut (first  plus second  cut) varied  from  56 to 62%.  
Thus the variation  is not as great  as might  be expected  and can if required  be 
overcome  by varying  the level  of supplementation  in winter.
Conclusions
Sward  height  is a simple,  easy  way to make  measurement  that  can be used  as 
the basis  on which  to manage  grazing  systems.  It provides  an index  of herbage  
production,  pasture  utilization  and animal  performance.  Through  the grazing  
season  target sward heights  for different  types of livestock  under  different  
regimes  can be achieved  by integrating  the grazing and conservation  
programmes  on the farm. The results  of adopting  this approach  are that levels  
of animal  performance  and output  become  very  predictable  and planning  of the 
enterprise  is much  easier.

Whole-Crop  Fodder-Beet  Silage:  
Research  Results

Fodder  beet  can produce  20 tonnes  of dry matter/ha  in one harvest  compared  
with 13 tonnes  of dry matter  from four cuts of grass. Fodder  beet silage  is also 
highly  digestible  (80-85%  DMD)  when soil contamination  is low. Conse ­
quently,  even though  production  costs  are high,  it can be a cost  effective  "fodder  
concentrate" . The  research  reported  in this  paper  is the first  stage  of  a programme  
to develop  an integrated  nutritional  package  based  on whole  crop fodder  beet 
silage  (WCFBS).
Fodder  beet  was harvested  using  a fodder  beet  silage  harvester  and ensiled  in 
a conventional  walled  silo. The chemical  composition  of the silage  is given  in 
Table  1.

Whole  crop  fodder  beet  underwent  an extensive  lactic  acid  fermentation  in the 
silo. Ethanol  production  and residual  levels  of water soluble  carbohydrates  
(WSC)  were high. Crude  protein  and fibre levels  were lower  than would  be 
expected  from  grass  silage.  Although  thet/i  vitro  DMD  value  was  lower  than  was 
anticipated,  this is partly  explained  by the high levels  of ash.
A large scale animal  production  experiment  was carried  out in which  the 
following  treatments  were  compared:
121
1. Grass  silage  {ad libitum)  + 4 kg concentrates/day .
2. Whole  crop fodder  beet silage  (ad libitum)  + 1 kg barley/day.
3. Whole  crop fodder  beet silage  {ad libitum)  + 1 kg soyabean/day.
4. Concentrates  {ad libitum)  (i.e. barley  beef).
The dietary  regimes  are described  in more  detail  in Table  2. These  regimes  
were  intended  to eliminate  possible  nutritional  problems  such  as availability  of 
a long fibre source,  inadequate  phosphorus  or too rapid fermentation  in the 
rumen.

At this Stage  the high  nutritive  value  of whole  crop  fodder  beet  silage  has been  
confirmed.  Further  experiments  are required  to determine  the requirement  for 
supplementary  protein  under  a wider  range  of circumstances.  In addition  the 
need for a supplementary  source  of long fibre and the mineral  and buffer  
requirements  (if any) need to be clarified,  as well as the effects  on intake  and 
performance  of soil (ash)  contamination.
Although  the whole  volume  of effluent  produced  by fodder  beet  silage  has not 
been properly  quantified,  it appears  to be much higher  than occurs  with that 
produced  by grass  silage  under  normal  conditions.  In addition,  fodder  beet  silage  
effluent  has a high content  of nutrients  and is therefore  too valuable  a feedstuff  
to waste.
In a second  experiment  Friesian  steers  were  offered  unwilted  grass  silage  (ad 
libitum),  fresh  water  and 1 kg rolled  barley/head  daily. Twenty  animals  had ad 
libitum  access  to the effluent  from whole  crop fodder  beet silage  (composition  
in Table  4) while  a further  20 had not. Fodder  beet silage  effluent  had a higher  
DM content  and lower  ash and crude  protein  levels  than effluent  from grass  
silage. The animal  performance  results,  summarised  in Table 5, show that 
liveweight  gains,  adjusted  for differences  in gut-fill  between  the two treatments,  
were improved  by intake  of effluent.  The effluent  from whole  crop fodder  beet 
silage  clearly  has a high nutritive  value  and should  be used as a feedstuff  rather  
than be spread  on grassland.  The next  research  objective  is the incorporation  of 
this effluent  into a diet along  with fodder  beet silage.

The major  conclusions  from the experiments  reported  here are :
(a) It is relatively  easy  to achieve  good  preservation  of whole  crop  fodder  beet 
silage,  despite  soil contamination.
(b) High intakes  and good  animal  performance  can be achieved  where  whole  
crop  fodder  beet  silage  is fed as ^e major  component  of the diet. The  effects  
of reducing  ash levels  are, as yet, unproven.

Crossbreeding  of Friesian  Dairy  Cows
M. G. KEANE
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
According  to Central  Statistics  Office  data,  total  cow  numbers  were2,088,300  
in June 1990. Of these, 1,463,600  (70.1%)  were dairy cows,  predominantly  
Friesians.  The  Cattle  Artificial  Insemination  (AI)  Service  carried  out 1,069,482  
inseminations  in 1989. This  represents  about  52%  of all cows  but when  account  
is taken  of unrecorded  "Do it Yourseir  inseminations  and of the fact that there  
is always  a small  proportion  of cows  which  are not bred for various  reasons,  it 
seems  that 55% to 60% of all matings  are by AI. While  there  is no break-down  
of inseminations  by type,  it is widely  accepted  that it is very largely  dairy  cows  
which are inseminat^.
Distribution  of inseminations  by breed
The distribution  of inseminations  by breed  type,  together  with the incidence  
of serious  calving  difficulty,  calf  mortality  within  48 hours  of birth  and gestation  
length  are shown  in Table  1. As would  be expected  because  of the need  to provide  
replacement  heifers  for the dairy  herd,  Friesian  was the predominant  sire breed,  
and represented  37%  of all inseminations.  After  the Friesian,  the early  maturing  
breeds  accounted  for 27% of inseminations  while  the continental  breeds  ac­
counted  for 35%. The  Charolais,  Limousin  and Simmental  at 9-11  % each  made  
up the bulk  of the continentals.  Between  them.  Blonde  d'Aquitaine  and Belgian  
blue accounted  for only 3% of inseminations.  For the Friesian,  Angus  and 
Hereford  breeds,  serious  calving  difficulty  was in the range 1.9% - 2.5%.  
Simmental,  Limousin  and Belgian  blue breeds  were  in the range  4.8%  - 5.4%,  
while  the Charolais  value  was over  6%. The figure  for the Blonde  d'Aquitaine  
is abnormally  high  due  to the inclusion  of  a small  number  of bulls  with  a very  high 
incidence  of calving  difficulty  initially.  Since  1982  however,  the serious  calving  
incidence  from 701 Blonde  d'Aquitaine  calving  records  is 4.4%. For Friesians,

Angus  and Hereford,  mortality  ranged  from 1.5% - 1.8% while for all the 
continentals  it was in the range  2.2%  - 2.8%. Gestation  lengths  for Simmental  
and Belgian  Blue progeny  were 2-3 days longer  than for Friesians,  while  for 
Charolais,  Limousin  and Blonde  d’Aquitaine  progeny  gestation  lengths  were  4- 
5 longer than for Friesians.  In summary,  therefore,  the direct effects  on 
calving  of using a continental  rather  than a traditional  breed  of bull are an 
increase  of 3-4 days in gestation  length,  1% extra  calf mortality  and about  3% 
units  more  calving  difficulty.
Effects  of bull breed  on cow performance
Some  years  ago a major  survey  of Irish  dairy  herds  using  two or more  breeds  
of bull was undertaken.  The comparison  of Friesian,  Hereford,  Charolais  and 
Simmental  bull breeds  is shown  in Table  2. Heifer  data are excluded.  In this 
survey,  breed  of bull had no effect  on lactation  length  or on current  or subsequent  
lactation  yield but all beef bulls extended  the calving  to calving  interval.  
Charolais  and Simmental  sired  calves  were  5-8 kg heavier  at birth  than  Friesian  
and Hereford  sired  calves.

Because  this survey  gave inconclusive  results  on a number  of important  
issues,  a controlled  experiment  was undertaken  to compare  the effects  of mating  
Friesian,  Hereford  and Charolais  bulls  to Friesian  dairy  cows. Although  differ ­
ences  in milk  yield  were  not significant,  there  was a tendency  particularly  for the 
Charolais  bull  to reduce  milk  yield  by 1 % - 2% in both  the current  and subsequent  
lactations  (Table  3). This reduction  can be attributed  mainly  to the fact that the 
Charolais  sired  calves  were  4-5 kg heavier  at birth than Friesian  and Hereford  
sired calves. Surprisingly,  the gestation  length  of Hereford  sired calves  was

similar  to that  for Charolais  sired  calves  and the gestation  lengths  for all three  bull 
breeds  (Table  4) was longer  than  reported  by the Department  of Agriculture  and 
Food  (see  Table  1). While  there  are large  differences  between  bulls  in gestation  
length  of their  progeny,  there  are data  from  Moorepark  (Mee,  1989)  showing  that 
the gestation  length  for Friesians  is about  two days  longer  than indicated  by the 
Department  of Agriculture  and Food (1990)  figures  and there are data from  
Grange  with  once-calved  heifers  showing  that  the gestation  length  for Herefords  
is 2-4 days longer  than indicated  by the Department  of Agriculture  and Food  
figures.  These  gestation  lengths  from  Moorepark  and  Grange  respectively  agree  
with the values  in Table  4. Sire breeds  had no effect  on calving  to first service  
interval  and there  was no difference  between  Friesians  and Herefords  in calving  
to conception.  Following  the birth  of a Charolais  sired  calf  however,  the calving  
to conception  interval  was increased  by about  5 days  and the number  of services  
per conception  was also increased.
In summary,  there  are no adverse  economic  effects  on the dairy  enterprise  
from  the use of a Hereford  bull  compared  with  a Friesian,  despite  the fact  that the 
gestation  interval  is slightly  longer.  Using  bulls  of the large  continental  breeds  
results  in a reduction  of 1-2% in milk yields  due to the longer  gestation  and 
calving  to conception  intervals.  It is also more  difficult  to maintain  a 365 day 
calving  interval.  By way of compensation  the continental  cross calf is 5 kg 
heavier  at birth.
Relationship  between  calving  difficulty  and calf growth  rate
It is widely  believed  that there  is a correlation  between  calving  difficulty  and 
subsequent  performance  of the calves.  This  is based  on the hypothesis  that  calves  
which  grow  most  rapidly  before  birth  would  also  grow  more  rapidly  afterwards  
and vice versa. This reasoning  has led to a belief  amongst  producers  that bulls  
with  a low incidence  of calving  difficulties  produce  inferior  calves  or calves  with 
a high incidence  of calving  difficulties.  This may be the case if bulls were  
selected  only on the basis of single  traits,  but bulls can and are selected  for a 
number  of traits  simultaneously.  Within  the present  approved  A.l. Beef  Bull  List 
(1990)  published  by the Department  of Agriculture  and Food,  there  appears  to 
be no association  between  the relative  breeding  val  ue of a bull for growth  rate  and 
his calving  difficulty  value.  This  is illustrated  in Table  5 which  contains  the mean  
values  for 6 bulls  (2 each Charolais,  Limousin  and Simmental)  in each of four  
categories  - highest  relative  growth  rate, lowest  relative  growth  rate, highest  
calving  difficulty  and lowest  calving  difficulty.  (Individual  bulls  may have  been

included  in more than one category).  The mean data presented  show no 
association  between  calving  difficulty  and  growth  rate. The sixth  highest  growth  
rate bulls  had a mean  relative  growth  rate value  of 115 and a calving  percentage  
of 3.9. The 6 lowest  growth  rate bulls  had a mean  relative  growth  rate value  of 
104 and had a calving  difficulty  percentage  of 4.0. Thus,  the 6 highest  and 6 
lowest  growth  rate bulls had similar  mean calving  difficulty  percentages.  
Similarly,  the 6 highest  calving  difficulty  bulls  had a calving  difficulty  percent ­
age of 6.2 and a relative  growth  rate value  of 109, while  the 6 lowest  calving  
difficulty  bulls  had a calving  difficulty  piercentage  of 2.2 and a relative  growth  
rate value  of 110. While  there  are bulls  with both high calving  difficulties  and 
high  relative  growth  rates  and vice  versa,  the data  in Table  5 show  that there  are 
bulls  with high relative  growth  rate values  and low calving  difficulties.  In fact, 
both the Charolais  bull and the Simmental  bull with the highest  relative  growth  
rate value  had also the lowest  calving  difficulty  percentage.
The absence  of a relationship  between  calving  difficulty  and relative  growth  
rate is further  illustrated  in Tables  6 and 7. In Table  6, the individual  Charolais,  
Limousin  and Simmental  bulls  with their respective  relative  growth  rate diffi­
culty had a somewhat  higher  relative  growth  rate value  than the one with the 
lowest  calving  difficulty,  this was  not the case  for the other  two  breed  types.  The 
two  Limousin  bulls  with  the highest  (7.7%)  and lowest  (2.7%)  calving  difficulty  
had almost  identical  relative  growth  rate values  while  the Simmental  bull with 
the highest  (5.7)  calving  difficulty  had a considerably  lower  relative  growth  rate

(109 V. 117) than the bull with the lowest  (1.8%)  calving  difficulty.  Similarly  
(Table  7), the Charolais  bull with the highest  relative  growth  rate value  had a 
lower  calving  difficulty  (2.6 v. 4.3%)  than the bull with the lowest  relative  
growth  rate. For the Simmental  also, the highest  relative  growth  rate bull had 
only  half  the calving  difficulty  of the lowest  relative  growth  rate  bull. However,  
the highest  relative  growth  rate Limousin  bull had a somewhat  higher  calving  
difficulty  than the lowest  relative  growth  rate Limousin  bull. These  data show  
conclusively  that while  high relative  growth  rate bulls may have high calving  
difficulties  and low calving  difficulty  bulls  may  produce  cdves  of relative  low 
growth  rate,  high  growth  rate  bulls  can  be easy  caving  and  easy  calving  bulls  can 
have high relative  growth  rate values.
Productivity  of less widely  used breeds
Canadian  Hereford : Hereford  bulls  from  Canada  were  imported  into  Ireland  
with  a view  to improving  the productivity  of the Hereford  breed.  There  has been  
little attempt  to quantify  this putative  improvement  particularly  in respect  of 
carcass  characteristics.  As part  of the beef  x dairy  breed  evaluation  programme  
at Grange,  Canadian  Hereford  x Friesians  were  compared  directly  with  Friesians.  
Since  traditional  British  Hereford  x Friesians  had earlier  been compared  with 
Friesians,  it was possible  to make  a comparison  (indirect)  of the two Hereford  
strains.  The  results  of this comparison  are shown  in Tables  8 and  9. The  Friesian  
data were  standardised  to the norm  for a two year  old beef  system  (i.e. carcass  
weight  of 320 kg) and the data for the two Hereford  strains  were adjusted  
accordingly.  At the same  age British  Hereford  crosses  were 7 kg heavier  and

Canadian  Hereford  crosses  were  27 kg heavier  than  Friesians.  Corresponding  
carcass  weight  superiorities  were 10 kg and 22 kg respectively.  Both Hereford  
strains  had killing-out  rates  about  1 % unit  higher  than  Friesians.  However,  even  
though  the Hereford  cross  strains  produced  10 kg and 22 kg more  carcass  they  
produced  2 kg less and only  4 kg more  muscle  respectively  than  Friesians.  This 
was  because  all or practically  all of the extra  carcass  weight  was fat. In summary  
therefore,  compared  with British  Hereford  crosses,  Canadian  Hereford  crosses  
produced  20 kg more liveweight,  12 kg more carcass  weight  and 6 kg more  
muscle  at about  2 years  of age.
Carcass  characteristics  are shown  in Table  9. Both  Hereford  cross  strains  had 
better  conformation,  higher  fat scores,  higher  fat percentages  and lower  muscle  
and bone  percentages  than  Friesians  but there  were  no differences  in any respect  
between  the two Hereford  cross  strain  themselves.  The superior  conformation  
of the Hereford  crosses  was not associated  with  increased  muscle  percentage  (in 
fact it was lower),  larger  muscle  size (as indicated  by longissimus  area)  or more  
higher  value muscle  growth  rate than the British  Hereford  but there were no 
differences  between  the two strains  in carcass  grades  or composition.
Blonde  d'Aquitaine  : Blonde  d'Aquitaine  accounts  for less than 2% of Irish 
inseminations  but it is much  more  widely  used  elsewhere  (Northern  Ireland  and

with  Friesians  and Limousin  x Friesians  is shown  in Table  10. At about  2 years  
of age Blonde  crosses  were  25 kg liveweight,  15 kg carcass  weight  and 13 kg 
muscle  weight  superior  to Limousin  crosses.  Limousin  crosses  in turn were  9 kg 
carcass  weight  and 17 kg muscle  weight  superior  to Friesians.  Blonde  crosses  
had similar  conformation  to, and a lower  fat score  than Limousin  crosses  (Table  
11). They  also  had less fat, more  muscle  and more  bone  in the carcass.  Both  beef  
crosses  had a slightly  higher  proportion  of higher  value  muscle  and a considera ­
bly greater  muscle  size than Friesians.  In conclusion  both beef  crosses  were  
considerably  superior  to Friesians  in all important  respects  and at the same  age 
Blonde  crosses  were  superior  to Limousin  crosses  in slaughter  weight,  muscle  
weight  and muscle  percentage.

purpose  breed  which  is reported  to be little  behind  the Friesian  in milk  production  
ability,  but has better  beef  characteristics.  With  the introduction  of milk  quotas,  
a view emerged  that in certain  situations,  crossing  with the MRY  might  be 
appropriate  as it would  maintain  milk production  potential  of the herd while  
improving  beef  merit.
Like  other  continentals,  the Belgian  Blue  breed  was imported  to improve  the 
overall  growth  rate and carcass  characteristics  of catde  from  both the dairy  and 
beef  herd. Because  both the MRY and Belgian  Blue  breeds  were  considered  to

MRY  and Belgian  Blue  bulls. The calving  data are shown  in Table  12. MRY  
and Belgian  Blue sired calves  had gestation  periods  one and two days longer  
respectively  than  Friesians.  Both  MRY  and  Belgian  Blue  calves  had  similar  birth  
weights  (4 kg heavier  than  Friesians)  and as would  be expected,  both  exotics  had 
somewhat  greater  calving  difficulty  with  little  difference  between  the MRY  and 
Belgian  Blue  in this respect.  Overall,  calving  difficulty  was not serious.
Performance  of the progeny  is shown  in Table  13. Compared  with Friesian,  
MRY  X Friesian  steers  were  8 kg liveweight  heavier  at slaughter,  they  had 1.1%  
units  higher  kill-out  so they were 11 kg carcass  weight  heavier.  However,  they  
had only  4 kg extra  muscle.  Belgian  Blue  x Friesians  were  20 kg heavier  than 
Friesians  at slaughter.  They had 2.2% units higher  kill-out  so their carcass  
weight  was 24 kg heavier  and muscle  weight  was 34 kg heavier.  Conformation  
was 0.4 units  better  for the MRY  crosses  than  Friesians  but fat score  was slightly

the MRY  crosses  had about  1% units  less muscle  and 1% unit more  fat.
Overall,  MRY  crosses  were  slightly  more  productive  than  Friesians,  but they 
were  not any leaner.  Belgian  Blue  crosses  were  0.8 units  superior  in conforma ­
tion to Friesians  and had  0.3 units  lower  fat score.  They  also  had less bone,  more  
muscle,  less fat and a larger  muscle  size. In summary  therefore,  Belgian  Blue  
crosses  are vasUy  superior  to Friesians  in carcass  weight,  muscle  size, muscle  
percentage  and conformation.
Piedmontese  : The Piedmontese  breed  originated  in North  West  Italy. In 
terms  of muscling,  it is estimated  that about  60%  of the bulls  are double  muscled

The only country  in which  Piedmontese  is widely  used  seems  to be the Nether ­
lands  (Table  15). In 1975  less than l%ofNetherland  inseminations  was to beef 
bulls  and by 1985 it was less than 4%. In the following  years  to 1988 it trebled  
to over 12%. In 1975,  the main  beef  breed  was the Dutch  Red and White  with 
the Charolais  and  Limousin  making  up the rest. Ten  years  later  those  three  breeds  
had virtually  disappeared  and the Pi^montese  now accounted  for almost  70%  
of inseminations  with the Belgian  Blue  and Blonde  d'Aquitaine  being  the only 
other  breeds  of significance.  Thus  by Irish standards,  the Dutch  beef  breeds  are 
all minority  breeds.
The ranking  for various  traits of the progeny  from a number  of breeds  
including  the Piedmontese  relative  to the Charolais  is shown  in Table  16. The 
Piedmontese  had a growth  rate lower  than  any other  breed  except  the Limousin.  
However,  it had the highest  dressing  percentage  so its carcass  weight  ranking  
was above  the Limousin,  similar  to that  of the Blonde  d'Aquitaine  but below  that 
of the Charolais  and Belgian  Blue. In muscle  weight  it exceeded  everything  
except  the Belgian  blue. On the basis  of these  figures  therefore,  the Piedmontese  
is not exceptional  in growth  rate but has a high dressing  percentage  and good  
carcass  characteristics.  However,  there is nothing  to suggest  that its overall  
productivity  is better  than  the Charolais  or Belgian  Blue. From  the United  States  
a comparison  of the Piedmontese  and Gelbvieh  (similar  to the Simmental)  has 
been reported  (Table  17). The Gelbvieh  had a better  growth  rate but a poorer

dressing  percentage  with  the result  that both  breeds  had similar  carcass  weights.  
However,  the Piedmontese  had less bone  and fat and more  muscle.  Both sets  of 
results  are in agreement  on the high dressing  percentage  and high muscle  
percentage  of the Piedmontese  but there is nothing  to suggest  that in overall  
productivity  it is clearly  superior  to all the other  common  continentals.
Ranking  of all breeds : Detailed  comparisons  of the main  breeds  have  been  
reported  recently  (Keane  and More O'Ferrall,  1987; More OFerrall,  1987;  
Keane,  1990). A summary  of the ranking  of all the breed  types  is contained  in 
Tables  18 and 19. Friesians,  Hereford  (British),  Limousin,  Blonde  d'Aquitaine  
and MRY  crosses  had similar  slaughter  weights  for age (Table  18). Canadian  
Hereford,  Simmental,  Charolais  and Belgian  Blue  crosses  had higher  slaughter  
weights  for age. All beef crosses  had higher  carcass  weights  for age than 
Friesians.  Hereford  (British),  Limousin  (Canadian),  Blonde  d'Aquitaine  and 
Belgian  Blue cross values  were higher,  and Simmental  and Charolais  cross  
values  were  highest  of all. In muscle  weight  for age,  the Hereford  crosses  did not 
retain  their relative  carcass  weight  superiority  over Friesians  whereas  all the

continental  crosses  extended  their superiority  relative  to Friesians.  Friesians,  
both  Hereford  crosses,  and MRY  crosses  had low and similar  muscle  weights  for 
age,  Limousin  crosses  were  intermediate  while  Blonde  d'Aquitaine,  Simmental,  
Charolais  and Belgian  Blue  crosses  had similar  high muscle  weights  for age.
At the same age, Friesians,  Limousin,  Simmental  and MRY crosses  had 
similar  carcass  fat scores.  Both  Hereford  crosses  had higher  scores  and Blonde  
d'Aquitaine,  Charolais  and Belgian  Blue  crosses  had lower  fat score  (Table  19). 
All beef crosses  had better  conformation  than Friesians  and there was little  
difference  in conformation  between  the common  beef crosses.  MRY  crosses  
were intermediate  in conformation  between  Friesians  and the beef crosses.  
Longissimus  area is an indicator  of muscle  size and the breed  types  fell into two 
distinct  groups  for this  characteristic.  Friesians,  both  Hereford  crosses  and MRY  
crosses  had similar  and much larger longissimus  areas. Despite  the large  
differences  in conformation  there  was relatively  little  difference  between  breed  
types  in the proportion  of total muscle  in the higher  value  joints.
Conclusions
1. Using  a continental  rather  than  a haditional  breed  of bull increases  gestation  
length  by 2-4 days,  increases  calving  difficulty  incidence  by about  3% units  
and increases  calf mortality  by about  1 % unit.
2. Compared  with a traditional  breed  of bull a continental  bull increases  the 
interval  from  calving  to conception  and the number  of services  per concep ­
tion. This  together  with  the longer  gestation  increases  the calving  to calving  
interval  and milk  yield  is reduced  by 1-2%.  However,  the continental  cross  
calf is about  5 kg heavier  at birth.
3. High relative  growth  rate continental  bulls can be easy calving  and easy 
calving  continental  bulls  can have  high relative  growth  rates.
4. Canadian  Hereford  x Friesians  have  about  3% units  higher  live and carcass  
growth  rates than traditional  British  Hereford  x Friesians  but there  are no 
differences  between  the strains  in carcass  characteristics.
135
5. At the same  age,  Blonde  d'Aquitaine  x Friesians  produced  5% more  carcass  
weight  and 6% more  muscle  than Limousin  x Friesians.
6. Compared  with Friesians,  Belgian  Blue x Friesians  produced  3% more  
liveweight,  8% more  carcass  weight  and 18% more  muscle  weight.  They  
also had 2.3% units  better  kill-out  and 0.7 units  better  comformation.
7. The  Peidmontese  has a lower  growth  rate than  other  continentals  except  the 
Limousin.  However,  it has a very high dressing  percentage  and a high 
muscle  percentage.  Its overall  productivity  is not superior  to the common  
continentals.
8. Overall,  there  is little difference  in productivity  between  Friesians,  Here ­
ford (both strains)  x Friesians  and MRY  x Friesians  especially  if muscle  
weight  is included  and conformation  is excluded.  All continental  crosses  
are superior  to these.
9. Carcass  weights  of Friesians  and Friesian  crosses  at similar  carcass  fat 
proportions  are : Friesians  320, Herefords  (both strains)  290, MRY  320, 
Limousin  360, Simmental  380, Blonde  d'Aquitaine  4(X), Belgian  Blue  400 
and Charolais  400.
