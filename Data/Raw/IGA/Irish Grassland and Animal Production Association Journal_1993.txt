Milk  Production  Systems  - Management  
and Economic  Considerations
S. CROSSE  and P. DILLON
Teagasc,  Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
The long-term  viability  of the dairy industry  is dependent  both  upon  the milk  
producer  receiving  sufficient  return  for his inputs  of labour,  capital,  and the 
consumer  being  offered  a quality  product  at a price which  is realistic  enough  
to ensure  an adequate  demand.  For the dairy farmer  this implies  making  Ihe 
maximum  use of grass  in the system  of milk  production  since  it is a cheap  source  
of high quality  feed.
This paper  will deal with 4 main topics  which  have a large  influence  on the 
viability of the dairy  farm.  These  include  (i) quota  size and quota  management,  
(ii) milk price,  (iii) calving  date, (iv) stocking  rate, and (v) milk yield  per cow.
In order  to discuss  these topics,  a model  farm will be used as illustrated  in 
Table 1.

The farm enterprises  will include  dairying  and beef. The discussion  will 
mainly  focus  on the opportunity  to increase  the farm margin.  In order  to pursue  
any of these options  at farm level, a more detailed  analysis  is required.
(1) Milk  quota  and quota  management
Since  the introduction  of milk  quotas,  the size of quota  on the farm  is a major  
determinant  of farm income.  The data in Table  2 show  the effect  of quota  size 
on farm gross margin.
Table  2

40,000 37,547
50,000 44,934
60,000 52,321
70,000 59,707
If the farm  quota  could  be increased  from  50,000  to 70,000  gallons,  this would  
result in an increase  in farm gross margin  from £44,934  to £59,707.  This 
represents  an increase  of £14,773  or £7,400  for an additional  10,000  of quota.  
Quota  management  is also important.  Many  dairy  farmers  have  too many  cows  
for the quota  on the farm. In the early years after the introduction  of quotas,  
it was  possible  to avail  of “flexi ” milk.  But in recent  years,  this policy  has proved  
to result  in high risk farming.  Many  farmers  now have to dry off cows early  
and reduce  feeding  especially  in the early spring  period.  This is resulting  in 
reduced  farm  profit.  It should  also be recognised  that the quota  size per holding  
in Ireland  is relatively  small as can be seen from Table  3.

The additional  gross margin  return  per gallon  of milk quota  as influenced  
by milk yield per cow and milk price is shown  in Table  4.

It is evident  from these data that the value of an additional  gallon  of milk 
quota  is very much  dependent  on the yield level of the herd and the prevailing  
milk price at the time. This must be considered  if additional  milk quota  is to 
be leased.
Milk price
The relatively  high income  from dairying  in Ireland  in recent  years is due 
to a large extent  to a high milk price. The effect  of milk price on farm gross  
margin  and net margin  is shown  in Table  5.

100 50,075 15,075
The farm gross margin  for a milk price of 70, 80, 90 and 100 p/gallon  is 
£34,698,  £39,841,  £44,934  and £50,075  respectively.  When  fixed costs and 
living expenses  are considered  the net margin  is -£302,  £4,841,  £9,934  and 
£15,075  respectively.  If milk price  drops  to 70p/gallon  then there will be very 
little surplus  cash available.  This emphasises  the extent  to which  farms with 
a small milk quota  are dependent  on milk price.
Calving  date
The effect of calving  month  on the cost of milk production/cow  and on 
margin/cow  is shown  in Table  6.

* if winter  bonuses  are paid (20 p/gallon)
Calving  date has a large influence  on the seasonality  of milk supply,  on the 
cost of milk production  and on farm profit. The spread  of calvings  is also 
important.  If no milk bonus payments  are available  then the calving  date 
(compact  calving  essential)  should  be concentrated  just prior to the start of the 
grazing  season  (early  March  in the south  of Ireland).  Calving  in January  will 
add £44/cow  to costs  and calving  in October  will add  £ 114/cow  to costs.  January  
calving  will reduce  margin  by £23/cow  while October  calving  will reduce
margin  per cow by £57 (if no milk bonus  is paid).  Systems  of milk  production  
based  on March  calving  result  in a highly  seasonal  milk supply  pattern.  This 
is not suitable  for the full range  of product  mix in Ireland.  Some  autumn  calving  
is consequently  necessary  and winter  milk  bonuses  are paid  to encourage  farmers  
to produce  out of season  milk. Winter  milk schemes  can best be exploited  by 
concentrating  the majority  of calving  to the start  of the grazing  season  and then  
calving  the remainder  of the herd in late September/early  October.  Generally,  
a ratio of 60% spring  and 40% autumn  calving  results  in profitable  systems  of 
milk  production  where  up to 35%  of total  milk  supply  is required  by the processor  
in the period  from October  to February.  All the advantages  of the extra  bonus  
can easily  be eroded  by a scattered  calving  pattern.  The milk processor  might  
best be advised  to encourage  100% autumn  calving  using selected  farms  and 
then combine  the milk from the total pool of milk in the factory.
Stocking  rate
Traditionally  milk  production  systems  in Ireland  were  driven  by high  output  
per acre even if this resulted  in a depression  in milk yield per cow. Since  the 
advent  of milk  quota,  this situation  has changed.  The  farm  quota  is now  generally  
more  limiting  than  the land  area.  There  is now  no need  to have  very  high  stocking  
rates for the dairy  cows  especially  since  the return  from allocating  excess  land 
to other enterprises  is low. Performance  per cow has now assumed  more  
importance  than performance  per acre.
The effect  of calving  month  and stocking  rate on cost of milk production/  
cow and on margin/cow  is shown  in Table  7.

March 0.95 - 7 49
A reduction  in stocking  rate from 0.85 ac/cow  to 0.95 ac/cow  for March  
calving  cows  reduces  costs  by £7/cow  but it increases  the margin/cow  by £49. 
This is due mainly  to extra  performance  by allocating  more  grass to the cow. 
It is possible  now to have a plentiful  supply  of high quality  grass available  to 
the dairy  cow and this can  be easily  achieved  by reducing  the stocking  rate. The 
benefits  are mainly  seen  from mid season  onwards.  Lowering  the stocking  rates,  
however,  presents  many  challenges  to the farmer  in order  to maintain  quality  
grass to the cow at all times.
Milk yield/cow
High genetic  merit cows are very important  for profitable  dairying.  The 
continued  improvement  of the genetic  merit  of the herd is achieved  by breeding
the cows  to the best sires available.  It is important  that the genetic  potential  of 
these  animals  is fully  exploited  by having  them  well  fed and with  a major  portion  
of the feed coming  from grazed  grass. There are indications  now that dairy  
farmers  are neglecting  milk  yield  per cow  with  a consequent  loss in farm  income.  
This is due in part to poor quota  management  (too many cows for the quota  
available)  and  an over-emphasis  on reducing  the variable  cost  of milk  production  
which  can result  in a loss in milk receipts.  When  considering  milk yield per 
cow, cognizance  must be taken  of its effect  on the numbers  of cows  to fill the 
quota,  the capital  investment  in livestock  and buildings,  the opportunity  cost 
of this capital  as well as the land, labour,  etc.
The effect  of milk yield/cow  on farm profitability  is shown  in Table  8. The 
milk yield per cow is allowed  to vary without  a change  in variable  costs per 
cow (better  management).

Farm  income  can be increased  by up to £3,000  or 6 p/gallon  of quota  by having  
a 1,200 gallon  herd vs a 1000 gallon  herd. The variable  costs for the dairy  
enterprise  can be reduced  by up to 5 p/gallon  by having  a 12(X) gallon  herd vs
a 1000  gallon  herd. The exploitation  of the potential  of a herd should  also result  
in the following  additional  benefits:  1) Sale of surplus  cows  releases  capital,  2) 
Lower  labour  requirement,  3) Less demand  for additional  dairy facilities,  4) 
Opportunity  to use the released  land  to reduce  further  the cost  of milk  production.
It is not clear if it will be profitable  for Irish dairy farmers  to continue  to 
breed  their  cows  to the best sires available  in the world.  Our low cost systems  
of milk production  based  on grass and silage  may not be adequate  for these  
animals.  They may have the effect  of pulling  in high cost systems.  This is an 
issue which  needs  to be researched.
Summary
Traditionally  milk  production  systems  in Ireland  (pre-quota)  were  driven  by 
the achievement  of high  output/acre  and generally  resulted  in a highly  seasonal  
milk  supply  pattern.  With  the introduction  of milk  quotas,  the decision-making  
process  to devise  the optimum  system  on dairy farms  became  more  complex.  
There  is less emphasis  now  on very  high  stocking  rates.  To achieve  the maximum  
return  from  the milk  quota  available  on the farm,  the dairy  farmer  has to consider  
the milk  supply  and milk  quality  requirement  of the food  industry. High  margins  
can be achieved  by maximising  the receipts  from  the farm  as well as  controlling  
costs.  Milk  yield/cow,  milk price and a high price  for calves  and cull cows  are 
of critical  importance.  Costs (variable,  fixed and depreciation  costs)  are also 
very important  and need to be continuously  reviewed.  Care must be taken in 
the drive to reduce  costs so as not to reduce  the receipts/cow  on the farm too 
much.  The goal should  be to maximise  net margin  from the farm. Losses  due 
to reproductive  wastage,  animal  health,  etc. need to be controlled.  The milk 
production  system  will need to be sustainable  economically  and in terms  of its 
impact  on the environment  and on the quality  of life for the farm family.
Achieving  High  Performance  from  Dairy  
Cows on Grazed  Pastures

Before  the introduction  of milk quotas  in Ireland,  profitable  dairying  was 
driven  by the objective  of increasing  farm sales of milk. This was mainly  
dependent  on using  high stocking  rates (3.0 to 3.5 cows/ha),  medium  levels  of 
N (300 kg/ha),  2 cuts of silage,  early and compact  calving  6-8 weeks  prior  to 
turn-out  to spring  pasture  and high genetic  merit  cows.  The use of such high 
stocking  rates depressed  cow milk  yields  by 10-20%  but maximised  the yields  
of milk/ha  by around  8-10%.  The requirement  for winter  feed as silage  placed  
a limit  on stocking  rate because  as stocking  rates increased  it became  increas ­
ingly difficult  to conserve  sufficient  winter  feed from the available  hectares.  
Approximately  6-7 tonnes  of silage  per cow were required  on dry land farms.  
An extra 2 tonnes  of silage  was required  on wet land farms  and therefore  the 
optimum  stocking  was some  20% lower.  The adequate  feeding  of the cow on 
grazed  grass  is now of central  importance.  The constraints  to intake  at pasture,  
feed requirement  of the cow,  feed  supply  at pasture,  supplementary  feeding  and 
the digestion  of grass  as well  as nutrient  supply  to the small  intestine  from  grass  
are major  issues  with regard  to potential  milk production  from pasture.  The 
research  programme  of the Dairy  Husbandry  Department  since  the quotas  has 
reflected  this change  of objectives.
Potential  production  from grazed  pasture
Many  factors  are well known to affect  production  of grazing  cows. The most  
important  sward  factors  are the quantity  and  quality  of grass  available  for grazing  
and the daily herbage  allowance  (stocking  rate) as well as the provision  of 
supplementary  feeds. In addition,  cow factors  play a major  role. Cows have  
different  milk production  potentials  (based  on genetic  indices).  Individual  cow 
intake  studies  at Moorepark  have shown  that for each extra 1 kg of FC milk  
production  at pasture,  the cow will consume  0.4 kg of extra  pasture  dry matter  
under  ad libitum  feeding  conditions  (Stakelum  and Connolly,  1987).  Genetic  
selection  for milk yield will produce  cows of high intake  potential  as well as 
higher  efficiency.  To fully exploit  the extra  feed demand,  these  cows need to 
be better  fed at pasture.
Farmers  often ask “What yields of milk will pastures  support  if I do 
everything  right and control  quality  and quantity  of herbage  throughout  the 
lactation? ” Experiments  at Moorepark  in 1985  with  early  February  calving  cows  
established,  when  daily  herbage  allowance  was twice  the daily  intake level  with 
high digestibility  pastures  (regrowths  of 4 weeks  after cutting)  throughout  the 
lactation,  that yields  of 204 and 183 kg of milk  fat and protein respectively  could  
be achieved  per cow (Stakelum,  1991). Higher  intakes  caused  no further  
increases  in milk  fat or protein  yields  but resulted  in increases  in cow  li veweights.

The results  indicated  that the herds  were  being  fed on pasture  to produce  milk 
at or near their potential.  Higher  genetic  material  would  be needed  to further  
increase  milk  production  from  pasture  under  these  conditions.  It is not intended  
to deal with  this subject  here  but  to describe  the recent  advances  in our  knowledge  
of pasture  feeding  of cows under  rotational  grazing.
Grass  supply  and cow demand  during  grazing
The traditional  system  of seasonal  milk  production  from  pasture  was based  
on high  stocking  rates  and compact  calving  6-8 weeks  prior  to turn-out  to spring  
pasture.  The  concentrate  input  in this system  was around  0.5 tonnes.  This  system  
was capable  of producing  70% of the milk from grazed  pasture  with the 
remaining  coming  from  silage  and concentrate.  The figure  of 70% refers  to the  
intake  of a lactating  cow from  calving  to drying  off. In this system  (see Figure  
1) grass supply  is not sufficient  to meet the feed requirement  of the cow in 
January  to March  or from October  through  to December.  There is a small  
deficiency  of grass  in April and  September.  Some  concentrate  feeding  at pasture  
was necessitated  in early April to sustain  yields  immediately  after turn-out  to 
pasture.  This  feeding  usually  ceased  by mid-April.  The first  grazing  cycle  lasted  
up to 10 April (normal  grass  growth  pattern)  and at this time  current  grass  growth  
rate was sufficient  to feed the cows when 45% of the farm was closed  up for 
silage.  The May/June  period  usually  produced  an oversupply  of grass  in those  
months  and this factor  was responsible  for poor on pasture  performance  later 
in the season.
The experiments  run at Curtins  farm since 1990 (Dillon  and Crosse,  1992)  
have examined  two major  factors  controlling  this supply  and demand  relation ­
ship, namely,  calving  date and stocking  rate. Altering  the calving  date changes  
the seasonal  demand  pattern  for grass  and reducing  stocking  rate increases  the

feed supply from grazed  grass. Figure  2 outlines  the supply and demand  
relationship  for a situation  where  cows  calve  6-8 weeks  later (ie. much  closer  
to the commencement  of grass  growth  at a 10% reduced  stocking  rate). It is now 
apparent  that the April and September  deficits  are eliminated  and the March  
and October  deficits  are reduced  substantially.  The feed  demand  in the January-  
April period  is reduced  because  there are less cows  in milk but the demand  is 
higher in September  to November  because  of lactation  stage.  With  this system,  
85% of the milk is produced  from grazed  grass compared  to the traditional

system  described  above.  This  means  that during  lactation  more  grazed  grass  was 
fed to the cows  and less of silage  and concentrate.  The problem  with the May/  
June surplus  continues  to exist in this system.  Figures  3 and 4 show the 
proportions  of milk  produced  from  the three  feed  sources  for the traditional  early  
calving  and the later March  calving  cows.
The later calving  system  at 2.6 cows/ha  produced  215 and 195 kg of milk  
fat and protein/cow,  respectively,  in 5600  L of milk. To achieve  this level of 
production  some  important  targets  with  regard  to cow and grazing  management  
need to be attained.  Compact  calving  of cows at the desired  date is essential.  
Grassland  management  is now more  critical  as a greater  proportion  of the cows  
diet during  lactation  is coming  from  grazed  grass.  Some  of the more  important  
factors  controlling  feed intake  at pasture  and milk yield of cows will now be 
considered.
Herbage  quality  and grazing  pressure
Grazing  experiments  during  1986-1990  (Stakelum  and Dillon,  1991)  using  
post-grazing  sward surface  height as a measure  of grazing  severity  under  
rotational  grazing,  established  the importance  of herbage  digestibility  on milk 
production  per cow. The overall  result from these experiments  was that the 
response  of dairy  cows  for the second  half  of lactation  to an extra 1 kg of DMI  
of pasture  was the production  of 1 kg of extra milk. This is at least the best 
response  possible  from  feeding  concentrates  at pasture  under  normal  conditions.  
This extra DMI from pasture  is achieved  by controlling  grazing  conditions  in 
order  to produce  dense  leafy  pastures  for the cows.  The financial  cost associated  
with this amounts  to zero because  it is not associated  with the purchase  of extra  
feed or the conservation  of forage  on the farm. In fact the benefits  are greater  
than  the extra  per  cow  production  achieved  because  pastures  which  are not either

Figure 5: Effect  of poor  grass  quality from July onwards
over or under  grazed  grow  much  better  and achieve  higher  spring  growth  rates  
in subsequent  years.  Additionally,  there  are also benefits  to be derived  in silage  
making  costs  as a greater  proportion  of total silage  can now be harvested  from  
the first cut in May.
One of the main  influences  on pasture  digestibility  is the proportion  of stem  
and dead material  present.  When  pastures  are under-grazed  during  April and 
May in a mistaken  effort  by farmers  to increase  intake,  stem elongation  occurs  
and the sward  achieves  a high rate of gross  herbage  production.  However,  the 
rate of pasture  senescence  also increases  dramatically  and the digestibility  of 
the pasture  declines.
Figure  5 outlines  the effect  of reduced  pasture  digestibility  on milk yield  per 
cow. The results  are an overall  summary  of 5 separate  whole  season  grazing  
experiments  where  different  pasture  digestibilities  were  evaluated  at a number  
of grazing pressures.  Cows  produced  about  an extra  50 kg (10 gals)  milk  during  
April-May  when  post-grazing  height  is at 8 cm or greater  compared  to tighter  
grazing.  However,  at equal grazing  pressure  later, cows lose 450 kg of milk 
(approx.  100 gals) due to the lower  pasture  digestibility.  This highlights  the 
importance  of grazing  relatively  tightly  (to 6 cm) in the period  of very active  
grass growth  (April-June).  The cows,  because  of the early  stage  of lactation  and 
the very high nutritive  value  of the herbage,  are well able to buffer  the effects  
of the high grazing  pressure.
Figure  6 outlines  what happens  where  grazing  pressure  is pitched  too high 
from  late June  onwards.  This means  grazing  below  8 cm. Cows  lose on average  
375 kg of milk  (80 gals).  This happens  whether  pasture  digestibility  is high or 
low. Too high  a grazing  pressure  is being  applied  on some  dairy  farms  in Ireland  
from July onwards  in an effort  to lengthen  the rotation  in order  to push grass
13
Figure  6: Effect  of too high a stocking  rate from  Juiy onwards
ahead  of the cows  into  the September-October  period.  Milk  production  per cow 
will suffer  as a result.  The logical  way to reduce  the autumn  deficit  is to use 
the correct  overall  stocking  rate and graze  the cows in such a way as to avoid  
depressing  their milk production  by large amounts.  This means  reducing  the 
grazing  pressure  from July onwards  (post-grazing  height  of 8 cm). The higher  
post-grazing  herbage  masses  will respond  by higher  growth  rates  in the recovery  
period.  The rotation  length  in the late summer/early  autumn  period  can only 
be lengthened  if grass supply  is high enough  to allow  for it. Otherwise  it will 
only be achieved  by low post-grazing  pasture  height  (or mass)  and a consequent  
reduction  in cow performance.
Figure  7 shows  what happens  if grazing  pressure  is lenient  in early season  
(>8 cm) and this reduced  quality  pasture  is subsequently  grazed  out by having  
a fairly high grazing  pressure  later on. This is not an uncommon  situation  on 
many  dairy farms  where  a buildup  of pasture  mass  occurs  in mid-summer  and 
this is eventually  grazed  out by the following  November/December.  In this 
situation  cows can lose up to 750 kg of milk (160 gals). The DMI is reduced  
by up to 4-5 kg mainly  because  of changes  in the ingestive  behaviour  of the 
cow. Prehension  of herbage  becomes  increasingly  difficult  for the cows  on the 
long  grass  due to the presence  of stem  and  dead  material  mixed  through  the green  
leaf canopy.  The digestibility  of the selected  material  falls (not as large as the 
depression  in the sward  digestibility).  Figure  8 shows  the milk production  per 
cow profile  for 4 farms  in the Cork area from pasture  from March  to August.  
These  farms  have  similar  calving  dates,  stocking  rates,  N input  and cow genetic  
merit  and yet by August  there is a difference  in milk production  of 7 kg/cow/  
day between  the farms. One succeeded  in achieving  high  production  throughout  
the whole  period.  The significant  point illustrated  here is that, by applying  the
14
Figure  7: Effect  of too high a stocking  rate and poor  grass  quality  from  July onwards
principles  outlined  of correct  grazing  height  during  the April/May  period  and 
from July onwards,  per cow performance  levels from pasture  similar  to the 
Curtins  farm can be achieved.
Topping  of pastures
Where  pastures  are undergrazed  by choice  in the April  to June  period  because  
of an unwillingness  of the farmer  to do so or because  it is physically  too difficult
Figure  8: Performance  for four farms  from  pasture
15
Figure  9: Effect  of very high grass  qualilty  on milk  yield
to do so because  of ground  conditions  and late turn-out,  topping  pastures  to 6 
cm can have a role in maintaining  pasture  digestibility.  Figure  9 outlines  the 
results  of recent  Moorepark  experiments  on this subject. Very  high  digestibility  
can be maintained  in the pastures  by mechanical  topping  during  stem  extension.  
It is vitally  important,  however,  to graze  these  pastures  at the correct  intensity  
later  on. Because  the tall grass  in close  proximity  to the faecal  deposits  has been  
defoliated  by topping  there will be less herbage  mass available  for grazing.  If 
previously  topped  swards  are grazed  at 8 cm from July onwards  an extra 375 
kg of milk (80 gals) per cow can be produced  compared  to the standard  milk 
production  profile  of the spring  calver.  Cows  grazing  these  swards  however  are 
more sensitive  to grazing  pressure  because  of the lower  available  herbage.  If 
grazing  is at 6 cm, cows  will lose about  84 kg of milk (18 gals).  The technique  
is most  suitable  on farms  which  have  below  optimum  stocking  rates  and  produce  
big surpluses  of grass in May. The toppings  can usefully  be grazed  in situ by 
other stock  on the farm.
Summary
Since the introduction  of milk quotas  the emphasis  has now shifted  to 
achieving  higher  performance  from  cows  and doing  this through  grazed  grass.  
Results  from  the present  experiment  at Curtins  has shown  that by a better  match  
of the feed demand  curve  to the grass  supply  curve,  a higher  proportion  of the 
milk  can be produced  during  the grazing  season  with much  reduced  concentrate  
inputs.  This means  calving  the cows closer  to the start of the grazing  season  
in March.  Also, by giving  the cows more land (10%),  the extra grass can be 
successfully  used to increase  performance  of the cows.
The most important  factors  which  affect  milk yield at pasture  (intake  and
16
digestibility  of the sward),  therefore,  need to be considered.  High intakes  at 
pasture  will occur  if the grazing  pressure  is very low. But because  of the nature  
of grass growth,  very lenient  grazing  pressures  will cause  large  declines  in the 
digestibility  of the sward  with  consequent  depressions  in intake  and  performance  
of cows.  Moorepark  grazing  experiments  over  the last 7 years  have  established  
the following  important  biological  responses:
1. Poor sward  digestibility  from July onwards  will cause  a loss of 90-100  
gallons  of milk per cow.
2. Too high a grazing  pressure  from July onwards  will cause  a loss of 80 
gallons  of milk per cow.
3. Imposing  too high a grazing  pressure  on poorer  quality  swards  will cause  
a loss of 160 gallons  of milk per cow.
4. Creating  very high digestibility  swards  by mechanical  topping  will give 
an extra  80 gallons  per cow from  July onwards  if those  swards  are grazed  
leniently  (>8 cm).  If they  are grazed  too tightly  (<8 cm) a loss  of 20 gallons  
per cow will result.
5. Grazing  paddocks  to the correct  height  from  April to  June  will create  high 
quality  pastures  for the remainder  of the grazing  season.  A penalty  of 10 
gallons  per cow results  from this compared  to leniently  grazing  those  
pastures  at that time.
It is, therefore,  a central  issue in grazing  management  for milk production,  
to graze  pastures  at the correct  severity  during  the first half  and the second  half 
of the grazing  season.  This can be done by using  feed budgeting.  This means  
making  decisions  on the overall  stocking  rate firstly.  Then the silage  conser ­
vation  programme  is decided.  These  two decisions  will determine  the effective  
stocking  rate during  the major  periods  of the grazing  season.  During  the season,  
day to day decisions  are made  on the basis of herbage  amount  or height  in the 
paddock  after  grazing.  Keeping  cows  longer  or shorter  in the paddock  to achieve  
this optimum  grazing  severity  is the corner  stone  of feed  budgeting.  A knowledge  
of grass supply  ahead  of the cows is important  in order  to anticipate  the onset  
of large  surpluses  or deficits.  This is got by a visual  assessment  of the amount  
of grass,  current  grass  growth  rate bulletins  from Teagasc  and the experience  
of the farmer  himself.
The  current  recommendation  from  Moorepark  to increase  the amount  of grass  
eaten by cows and increase  their milk production  is to allocate  more land to 
cows,  ie. drop  stocking  rate by 10% from 3.0 to 2.6 ha/cow  and continue  to use 
350 kg of N/ha to support  this. The post-grazing  severity  should  be 6 cm up 
to end of June and 8 cm later. The extra  land will allow  the grazing  season  to 
be significantly  extended.  For seasonal  milk production,  tbe cows  should  now 
be calved  closer  to grass.  This  also  allows  for an earlier  start  to the grazing  season  
because  of the lower  feed demand  (less cows now in milk in early March)  in 
early spring.
The challenge  is to get the parameters  which  adequately  describe  grazing  
severity  (height  of tall and short  grass and proportion  of each in the paddock)
17
communicated  clearly  at farm  level  so that farmers  can put these  very important  
grazing  principles  into practice  and increase  the productivity  of their cows  on 
pasture  and therefore  the returns  from dairying.

Intake  and Animal  Performance

The maximum  profitability  from  Irish  dairying  in a quota  situation  will occur  
from the economical  production  of each litre of quota.  Therefore  in the mild 
Irish temperate  climate  which is favourable  to grass production,  maximum  
utilisation  of grazed  grass and conserved  forage  will be important  to achieve  
maximum  profitability.  Even with indications  of reductions  in cereal  prices,  
home produced  forage will still be competitive.  Fitzgerald  (1992) valued  
concentrates  and silage  on a metabolisable  energy  (M.E.)  basis.  He concluded  
that relative  to high quality  silage  (DMD  = 750 g/kg and M.E. = 10.8 mj/kg  
DM),  for concentrates  to be competitive  on a per unit M.E. basis,  prices  would  
have  to be in the region  of £71 or £99/tonne  depending  on whether  a land  charge  
was included  or not. Today  on most  intensive  dairy  and calf-to-beef  farms  silage  
accounts  for 25-35%  of the annual  feed dry matter  intake  while  grazed  grass  
and concentrates  represent  approximately  55-70%  and 5-10% respectively.  
These proportions  may change  in the future  due to an extended  grazing  season,  
lower  stocking  rates,  animals  of higher  genetic  merit,  cheaper  substitutes  or milk  
price  reductions.  However,  conserved  forage  is always  likely  to be a major  part 
of Irish  livestock  production  systems  bridging  a feeding  period  from  2-4 months  
on southerly  dry soils to 6 plus months  on wet drumlin  soil in the northern  half 
of the country.
Over  20 million  tonnes  of fresh  herbage  is ensiled  annually  in the Republic  
of Ireland  (Fig. 1). Grass  accounts  for over  99%  of forage  ensiled,  the remainder  
being  made  up of crops  such as maize,  whole  crop fodder  beet and whole  crop 
cereals.  The feeding  value of silage varies depending  on factors such as 
digestibility,  initial  rate of fermentation,  final fermentation  quality,  etc., which  
ultimately  affects  its intake  characteristics.
Grazed  grass v silage
Intake  by dairy  cattle  grazing  grass  during  a 21 day rotation  can be as high 
as 15-17  kg DM while  that for silage  is only  9-13 kg DM supporting  milk  yields  
of up to 26 and 16 kg/hd/day  respectively.  However,  such a simple  comparison  
is not scientifically  valid because  animal,  feed and management  factors  (Table  
1) are not standard.  In a grazing  situation  animals  have  the opportunity  to select  
fresh  leaf  and reject  stem,  dead  material,  and growth  around  dung  pads. However  
when  offered  precision  chopped  silage,  which  is usually  lower  in digestibility  
than grass,  the animal  is not able to select  leaf from stem and may eat pieces  
from the total botanical  mass,  i.e. leaf, stem,  dead material,  weed species,  etc. 
in one mouthfull.
During  the ensiling  process  herbage  is changed  from  its fresh  state  to a pickled  
one resulting  in many changes  in its chemical  composition  (Table  2). Two  main
19

Figure  1 - Changes  in forage  production  in Ireland  1975-1990
changes  occur  in the chemical  composition  of the herbage  during  the ensiling  
process.  Firstly  the water  soluble  carbohydrates  are broken down  to lactic  acid 
and volatile  fatty acids.  Secondly  the true protein  concentration  is reduced  from  
approximately  80% of the crude  protein  in the  parent  material  to approximately  
59% in silage.  These  changes  may have big effects  on the intake  and animal  
performance  potential  of the resultant  silage.  Feed  value  of any forage  is affected  
firstly  by its voluntary  intake  and secondly  by its efficiency  of utilisation.
As silage  is a fermented  feed containing  quantities  of volatile  fatty acids  and 
alcohols,  dry matter  can be underestimated  by oven  drying  at high  temperatures

due to loss of volatile  components.  In order  to account  for losses  in volatile  fatty  
acids and alcohols  the determination  of dry matter  of the silages  should  be 
estimated  using a toluene  distillation  technique,  e.g. that proposed  by Dewar  
and McDonald  (1961),  corrected  for losses  of alcohols.  The difference  in dry 
matter  concentration  between  oven drying  and toluene  distillation  varies  de­
pending  on many  factors  including  fermentation  quality  of the silage,  dry matter  
concentration,  additive  used, etc. Keady  (1991 - unpublished  data) noted  that 
the dry matter  concentration  of 20 silages  varied  from  6.1 to 14.3%  higher  when 
estimated  using  the toluene  distillation  method  of Dewar  and McDonald  (1961)  
relative  to oven drying  at 85°C for 24 hours.
Ensiling  and its effect  on intake  
Sheep
Most of the initial  work carried  out examining  the effects  of ensiling  per­
se on forage  dry matter  intake was carried  out using sheep. Data from 65 
comparisons  in which  the intakes  of the parent  herbage  and the resultant  silages  
were compared  are presented  in Table  3. Intake  of silage  dry matter  by sheep  
varied  from as low as 38% (Harris  and Raymond,  1963) to as high as 84% 
(Demarquilly  and Dulphy,  1977)  of that of the parent  herbage.  From  the mean  
of 24 comparisons  in which  the silages  were well preserved,  as measured  by 
pH being  less than 4.2, ensiling  per-se  decreased  forage  dry matter  intake  of 
sheep  by 30%.  However  when the silages  were  poorly preserved  from  the mean 
of 41 comparisons  ensiling  per-se  decreased  dry matter  intake  of sheep  by 41 %. 
Ensiling  had little effect  on dry matter  digestibility  increasing  it by 1% and 
decreasing  it by 2%, for well and poorly  preserved  silages  respectively.
However  these data need to be interpreted  cautiously  when using them to

draw  conclusions  on the effect  of ensiling  on intake.  Some  of the comparisons  
were confounded  firstly  by poor fermentation  quality  of the resultant  silages  
and secondly  by the method  of determination  of the dry matter  concentration  
of the silage.  Also,  sheep  are more  sensitive  than cattle  to factors  such as silage  
fermentation  quality,  dry matter  concentration,  chop  length,  etc. Michalet  (1975)  
reported  that relative  to the fresh  herbage  sheep  ingested  59 and 20% less dry 
matter  when offered  the resultant  flail cut and precision  chop silages  respec ­
tively.  Possible  positive  effects  of the shorter  chop length  on intake  are firstly  
improvements  in silage  fermentation  quality,  secondly  increased  rates of pas­
sage  of the forage  through  the intestine  and thirdly  decreases  in the time  between  
the end of eating  and the beginning  of rumination.
Sheep  relative  to cattle
Data  from  seven  comparisons  in which  the same  parent  herbage  and resultant  
silages  were  fed to both sheep  and heifers  are presented  in Table  4. These  data, 
in which  the silages  were  of a good  fermentation  quality  and precision  chopped,  
illustrate  two important  points.  Firstly,  heifers  consumed  approximately  the 
same quantity  of dry matter  when the parent  herbage  was offered  in the fresh

or ensiled  form. Secondly,  using  the same forages  sheep  consumed  18% less 
forage  dry matter  in the ensiled  relative  to the fresh  state. Therefore  it is clear  
from the  data  presented  in Table  4 that  the sheep  is a poor  indicator  of the intake  
characteristics  of the mature  bovine  in a production  system  based on silage  
feeding.
Growing  and finishing  cattle
The  data  from  12 comparisons  in which  the effects  of ensiling  per-se  on forage  
dry matter  intake  and animal  performance  was investigated  are presented  in 
Table 5. All silages  were well preserved  as measured  by ammonia  nitrogen  
concentrations.  It should  be noted that one of the silages  reported  by Flynn  
(1978)  which  had a pH of 4.6 was wilted  prior  to ensiling.  Ensiling  tended  to 
reduce  forage  dry matter  intake  by 6% relative  to that of the parent  herbage.  
Other  than the  trial of Noller  etal.  (1963)  who  reported  a decrease  in dry matter  
intake  of 29% due to ensiling,  the 11 other  comparisons  reported  variations  in 
intake  from  -11 % to +6%. From  the data  of the six comparisons  in which  animal  
performance  was measured  as daily liveweight  gain, ensiling  per-se  reduced  
daily liveweight  gain by 25%, varying  from -35% (Wilkinson  et al., 1976)  to 
-11% (O’Kiely  and Flynn,  1982).  However  in the four comparisons  in which  
carcass  gain  was measured  ensiling  reduced  animal  performance  by 8%, ranging  
from -15% (Flynn,  1978) to an increase  of 1% (Flynn,  1978).
Current  research  at Moorepark
There  are little data available  in the literature  on the effects  of ensiling  on 
forage  intake  and animal performance  of lactating  dairy cattle.  Therefore  as part 
of an ongoing  series of studies  at Moorepark  investigating  intake  and perform ­
ance on grass silage diets an experiment  was initiated  using dairy cows to 
examine  the effects  of ensiling  per se on
(1) forage  dry matter  intake
(2) efficiency  of utilisation  of forage  for milk production,  and
(3) digestibility  of forages.
During April  and May 1992  herbage  from a silage  sward  which had not been 
grazed  since the previous  autumn  was zero grazed  by cows in late lactation

techniques  in 100 1 unwalled  clamps  either  untreated  or treated  with  formic  acid

of equal  parity,  liveweight,  at a similar  milk yield level and stage  of lactation  
as those fed the parent  herbage  previously.
At ensiling  the grass was of moderate  ensilability  having  dry matter,  water

g/kg, 154 g/kg DM, 1000  mg/kg  juice  and 590 mEq/kg  D.M.  respectively.  The

untreated  and formic  acid treated  silages  were well preserved,  having  pH’s of 
3.94 and 3.93 and ammonia  nitrogen  concentrations  of 95 and 75 g/kg total 
nitrogen  respectively.  Both silage  treatments  tended  to have higher  concentra ­
tions of dry matter,  modified  acid detergent  fibre and crude  fibre, and lower  
concentrations  of neutral  detergent  fibre compared  to the parent  herbage.
The effects  of ensiling  on forage  dry matter  intake  and animal  performance  
are presented  in Table  7. Compared  to the parent  herbage,  the untreated  silage  
significantly  decreased  forage  dry matter  intake  by 9% whereas  the decrease  
of 5% with formic  acid treatment  was not significant.  The decrease  in intake  
of the formic  acid treated  silage  is in accordance  with  the data  reported  in Table  
5; from  the mean  of 12 comparisons  silage  dry matter  intake  was decreased  by 
6%. Relative  to the parent  herbage  the untreated  and formic  acid treatments  
significantly  decreased  milk  yield  by 22%  and 20%;  milk  protein  concentration  
by 9.1% and 8.8%;  fat and protein  yield  by 28% and 24%;  and the yield of fat 
plus protein  per kg dry matter  intake  by 25 and 25% respectively.  The decrease  
in animal  performance  due to ensiling  is probably  due to two factors.  Firstly,  
silage  only  diets  result  in a lower  microbial  nitrogen  flow from the rumen.  ARC

(1984)  reported  microbial  nitrogen  flows in sheep of 1.43, 0.71 and 1.15 g 
nitrogen  incorporated  to microbial  nitrogen  per  MJ metabolisable  energy  in diets  
consisting  of grass,  silage  and silage  plus concentrates  respectively.  Secondly,  
apparently  ensiling  results  in a lower  efficiency  of utilisation  of metabolisable  
energy  for animal  production.  Similarly  the decreases  in animal  performance  
of the dairy cow recorded  in the present  study are in line with the data from  
six comparisons  reported  in Table  5 in which  the performance  of beef cattle  
was measured  as daily liveweight  gain.
At present,  in Moorepark,  there  is on-going  research  into verifying  the effects  
of ensiling  per-se  on forage  dry matter  intake  and animal  performance.  An 
understanding  of the factors  affecting  silage  intake  may in the future  result  in 
the development  of technology  to increase  animal  product  output  from con­
served  forage.  Also,  work  is ongoing  evaluating  possible  ways  of reducing  the 
difference  in animal  performance  obtained  when  the parent  herbage  is offered  
in the fresh or ensiled  state.
Conclusions
A large proportion  of the previous  work comparing  grass and silage  used 
sheep  as the experimental  animal.  Sheep  are more sensitive  than cattle  to the 
effects  of ensiling  on forage  intake,  being  sensitive  to factors  such  as chop  length,  
dry matter  concentration,  volatile  fatty acid concentrations,  digestibility,  etc. 
and have now been shown  not to be reliable  indicators  of intake  in the bovine.  
Some  comparisons  with beef cattle  reported  effects  on intake  due to ensiling  
of -29 to 6% and on liveweight  gain of -35 to -11%.  From  the current  work  at 
Moorepark  ensiling  reduces  the efficiency  of utilisation  of forage  for milk  
production.  The Moorepark  experiment  reported  has shown  that with lactating  
dairy cattle  a well preserved  formic  acid treated  silage  compared  to the parent  
herbage  did not significantly  reduce  dry matter  intake  but reduced  fat and protein  
yield by 24 percent.  Further  work is ongoing  to identify  ways of improving  
animal  product  output  from  silage.  Strategies  employed  could  involve  different  
types  of supplements,  better  management  of the grass  crop for ensiling  and on 
the day of harvesting  and the use of particular  additives  at ensiling.  Some  
bacterial  inoculants  have given  improvements  in animal  performance  through  
increases  in forage  intake  (Gordon,  1989; Mayne,  1990; Keady  and Steen, 
1993b),  digestibility  (Keady  et al., 1993; Keady  and Steen, 1993b)  and in 
efficiency  of utilisation  of digestible  energy  (Keady  and Steen, 1993a).

Trace  Element  Deficiency  in Irish Dairy  
Herds

The sheep  and cattle  are just not doing  well, even though  they seem  to be 
getting  plenty  of feed. Do you think  it could  be a mineral  deficiency? ’ Although  
this quote  is from New ^aland  (Clark  and Towers,  1983) it could  easily  be 
attributed  to an Irish  farmer.  While  nutritional  disorders,  including  deficiencies,  
are of more  significant  consequence  than are infectious  diseases  in developing  
countries  (McDowell,  1987),  their economic  significance  in developed  coun ­
tries is contested.  Kitwood  0991)  stated  that the understanding  of the impor ­
tance of adequate  trace element  status and the availability  of trace element  
supplements  is such that deficiencies  seldom  occur on British  dairy farms.  
However,  Howie  (1992)  observed  that management  changes  in recent  years  in 
the U.K. have seen much greater  utilization  of home-grown  feed, more spe­
cialized  pasture  grasses  and fertilizer  regimes,  more  purchase  of supplementary  
feed in “straight ” form, more use of maize  silage  and significant  changes  in 
calving  patterns,  with more cows calving  in late summer  without  receiving  
concentrate  feeding  during  the dry period.  All of these  factors  may predispose  
to mineral  deficiencies  in dairy herds.
The national  averages  for trace-element  composition  (mg/kg  DM) of Irish  
herbages  indicate  that, in general,  Irish  herbages  are low  in copper  (6.9),  iodine  
(0.19)  and selenium  (0.095)  and high in molybdenum  (2.1),  (Rogers,  Fleming  
and Gately,  1989).  Assuming  90 to 95  per cent  of the feed  intake  of dairy  cows  
consists  of grazed  or conserved  herbage  then the trace element  status  of dairy  
cows is dependent  primarily  on forage  trace  element  status.  This is particularly  
important  during  the latter  part of the grazing  season  and during  the dry period  
when supplementation  is generally  not practised.
According  to Rogers  et al. (1989) the most  important  trace  element  deficien ­
cies affecting  Irish  cattle  are those  of copper,  selenium,  iodine  and cobalt. Three  
surveys  of blood  vitamin  B 12 status  (inferential  cobalt  status)  of Irish cattle  
have shown  that between  7 and 12 per cent of herds  had a very low (< 100 pg/ 
ml)  B12 status,  (Poole,  O’Connor  and  Rogers,  1983;  Poole,  Rogers  and O’Connor,  
1984;  Rogers  and Poole,  1984).  However,  Rogers  and Poole  (1984)  stated  that 
there  are technical  problems  in cattle  plasma  vitamin  B12 analysis  which  restrict  
its value as a confirmatory  test of cobalt  deficiency.  In the only study of the 
plasma  inorganic  iodine  status  of Irish herds,  Rogers  (1992)  found  that 19 per 
cent of 158 herds had a very low (<100  ng/ml)  iodine  status  (Table  1). These  
data were  compiled  from  routine  analyses  conducted  on samples  received  from  
veterinary practitioners  and, as such,  may not be representative  of normal herds  
not under  veterinary  investigation.

cattle  (Rogers,  Arora,  Fleming,  Crinion  and McLaughlin,  1990).  Results  from  
routine  analysis  on samples  collected  by veterinary  practitioners  between  1984  
and 1987 indicate  no consistent  trend or change  over time in cattle blood  
selenium  status (Poole  and Rogers,  1987a).
While the base-line  surveys  of cattle blood copper  status (copper  or 
ceruloplasmin)  conducted  in the Republic  of Ireland  showed  that the majority  
of herds have a suboptimal  copper  status (Table 1), studies  conducted  in 
Northern  Ireland  found  a much  lower  prevalence  of copper  deficiency  (Table

This  review  of the available  published  data  on the blood  trace  elements  status  
of Irish cattle shows  that no base-line  survey  of Irish cattle  plasma  inorganic  
iodine  status  has been conducted  and the most  recent  base line surveys  of Irish  
cattle blood copper  and selenium  status were conducted  ten years ago. The 
objective  of this project  was to establish  the iodine,  copper  and selenium  status  
of dairy herds in the South  of Ireland  during  the spring  and autumn  of 1991.
Materials  and methods
Herd  selection:  The 50 dairy  herds  sampled  were  selected  because  they were  
participating  in a computerized  management  information  system  (DAIRYMIS),  
(Crosse,  1986).  As this was a base-line  study,  a farm  history  of clinical  problems  
or trace element  deficiency  was not used as a selection  criterion.  Farms  were  
located  in counties  Cork  (n=26),  Tipperary  (n=20),  Waterford  (n=3)  and Clare  
(n=l). These are predominantly  spring-calving  (December  to May) herds  
varying  in size from 33 to 293 cows. The physical  performance,  grassland  
management  and calving  and fertility  records  of these  farms  in 1991 are shown  
in Tables  2, 3, 4 and 5.
Sample  collection:  Samples  were  collected  during  the spring  of 1991 from  
dry cows only, and during  the autumn  of 1991 from lactating  cows only.  
Approximately  ten cows  per herd were sampled  in the spring  and ten cows  or 
ten per cent of the herd, which  ever  was the greater,  was sampled  in the autumn  
(Tables  6 and 7). The farmer  was asked to present  cows of different  ages,  
excluding  maiden  heifers.
All samples  were  collected  during  the morning  (8.00  -13.00  hrs)  by coccygeal  
venepuncture  into vacutainer  tubes containing  lithium  heparin.
Laboratory  analyses  : All samples  were analyzed  at Grange  Research  
Centre.  The copper  concentration  of whole  blood  samples  was determined  by 
atomic  absorption  spectrophotometry  (Spillane,  1966; Hilliard,  1979). The

activity  of  erythrocyte  glutathione  peroxidase  was  measured  by spectrophotometry  
based  on the method  of Paglia  and Valentine  ( 1967). Plasma  inorganic  iodine  
was determined  by a chromatographic  and colorimetric  technique  developed  
by Aumont  (1986).  The method  used for haemoglobin  measurement  (Anon,  
1969) was based  on the cyanmethaemoglobin  procedure.
Herd  classification:  The trace element  status  of each herd was classified  
based  on the mean  value  of the individual  sample  results  into  one  of six categories  
(Table  8). These  are the same break-points  used by the Teagasc  laboratory  at 
Grange  Research  Centre  to classify  the status  of samples  routinely  submitted  
by veterinary  practitioners.
Results
The mean (SD), minimum  and maximum  individual  animal  blood trace  
element  values  in spring  and autumn  1991 are shown  in Table  9. The data in 
Table  10 show  that only three  of the herds had a low copper  status  in the spring  
while  none had a very low copper  status.  Almost  half (n=24)  of all herds  had 
a normal  copper  status  during  the spring.  The  copper  status  of herds  in Tipperary  
was better  (16/20  herds  normal)  than that of herds  in Cork  (5/26  herds  normal).  
Over  one third of herds  had a very low selenium  status  in the spring  (Table  10) 
with a further  18 per cent  classified  as low selenium  status. The selenium  status  
of herds  in Tipperary  was better  (9/20  herds  normal)  than that of herds  in Cork
33
(5/26 herds normal).  Approximately  three-quarters  (72%)  of herds  had a low 
or very low iodine  status  in the spring  (Table  10). The iodine  status  of herds  
in Tipperary  was better  (7/20  herds  normal  or high)  than that of herds  in Cork  
(4/26 herds normal).
Two  of the low copper  status  herds  in the spring  also had very low selenium  
and iodine  status  while  the third low copper  status  herd had also had very low 
selenium  status.  Eight  of the very low selenium  status  herds  in the spring  did 
not have very low copper  or iodine  status  and ten had very low iodine  status  
also.  Nine  of the very  low iodine  herds  did not have  a very  low  copper  or selenium  
status.  Thus,  over half (54%)  of all herds were classified  as very low in one 
or more trace elements  in the spring.

The results  from the blood  sampling  survey  conducted  in autumn  1991 are 
shown  in Table 11. None  of the farms  had a very low copper  status  and only 
two farms  had a low blood  copper  status.  The copper  status  of herds in Cork  
was better  (10/16  herds normal)  than that of herds in Tipperary  (4/20 herds  
normal).  Half  of all herds  had a low or very low selenium  status  in the autumn  
(Table  11). The selenium  status  of herds  in Tipperary  was better  (11/20  herds  
normal)  than that of herds  in Cork  (4/26  herds  normal).  Almost  ninety  per cent 
(86%)  of herds  had a low or very low blood  iodine  status  in the autumn  (Table  
11). The percentage  of herds  with low or very low blood  iodine  status  did not 
differ  greatly  between  counties.
One of the low copper  status  herds in the autumn  also had very low iodine  
status  and the other also had very low selenium  status.  Three  of the very low 
selenium  status  herds  in the autumn  did not have  very  low copper  or iodine  status  
and twelve  also had very low iodine  status. Twenty  three  of the very  low iodine  
status  herds  in the autumn  did not have a very low copper  or selenium  status.  
Thus,  over three-quarters  (76%)  of all herds  were classified  as very low in one 
or more trace elements  in the autumn.
The distribution  of herds in the autumn  which  were classified  as normal,  
marginal,  low or very  low trace  elements  status  in the spring  is shown  in Table  
12. While  the majority  (96%)  of herds  classified  as normal  or rharginal  copper  
status  in the spring  were again  classified  as normal  or marginal  copper  status  
in the autumn,  none  of the three  herds  classified  as low copper  status  in the spring  
had a low copper  status  in the autumn  (Table  12). Approximately  three-quarters

(74%)  of herds  classified  as normal  or marginal  selenium  status  in the spring  
had a similar  status  in the autumn  (Table  12). Likewise,  77% of herds  classified  
as low or very low selenium  status in the spring  were classified  in the same  
categories  in the autumn.  While  only 14 per cent of herds  classified  as normal  
or marginal  iodine  status  in the spring  had a similar  autumn  status,  eighty  six 
per cent of herds  classified  as low or very low iodine  status  in the spring  had 
a similar  autumn  status (Table  12).
Discussion
The data presented  on the physical  performance  and grassland  management  
of the farms  sampled  (Tables  2, 3, 4 and 5) show that these farms  are repre ­
sentative  of intensive  progressive  dairy farming  in the south  of Ireland,  which  
is the main dairying  area of Ireland.  Their  farming  performance  is comparable  
with the top twenty  five per cent (ranked  on margin  over  feed and fertilizer  per 
1000 gallons)  of all farm data recorded  on the DAIRYMIS  management  
information  system  (Cliffe,  1990).
The proportion  of herds  with a low or marginal  copper  status  (0.44-0.68  ug/ 
ml) in both the spring  and autumn  in this study (52-72%)  is similar  to the 
proportion  of herds  (35-80%)  with a marginal  or low copper  status  (0.40-0.75  
ug/ml)  reported  in previous  Irish studies  (Table  1 ). However,  the absence  of 
very low copper  status  herds  (<0.44  ug/ml)  in this study  is in contrast  with all 
of the earlier  Irish studies  which  found  that between  10 and 26 per cent of herds  
had a very low copper  status  (Table  1). The data reported  here are similar  to 
more recent  Irish data which  showed  that only one to two per cent of herds  had 
a very low copper  status  (Poole  and Rogers,  1987a).  Differences  between  this 
and previous  studies  reflect  differences  in survey  location,  sample  collection  
procedures  and possibly  increased  awareness  of hypocuprosis.
The proportion  of herds  with a very low inferential  selenium  status  (<35 iu 
GPX/g  HB) in both the spring  and autumn  in this study (30-36%)  is similar  to 
that reported  by Poole  et al. (1983)  and Rogers  and Poole  (1984)  for very low 
selenium  status (<25 iu GPX/g  Hb) herds. Both Poole et al. (1984) and 
McMurray and Rice  (1982)  found  a much  higher  proportion  of herds  with  a very 
low selenium  status,  76% and 85%,  respectively,  in mainly  dairy  farms  around  
the Shannon  estuary  and suckler  farms  in the North  of Ireland.  These  differences  
reflect  differences  in geographical  location,  animal type and management  
practices.
While  there  are no comparable  data available  on the plasma  inorganic  iodine  
status of Irish dairy herds,  Rogers  (1992)  stated that over a two year period  
between  33% and 70% of herds from twelve  counties  had a low or very low 
iodine  status. Previously,  Rogers  and Poole  (1989)  had confirmed  severe  iodine  
deficiency  (<20  PII ug/ml)  in eight  counties.  The  prevalence  of goitre  and thyroid  
hyperplasia  in cases  of bovine  perinatal  mortality  reported  by Mee (1991a  and 
1991b)  provide  additional  evidence  of iodine  deficiency  in Irish dairy herds.
In all herds  where  a low copper  status  was detected  there was a concurrent
37
very low iodine  or very low selenium  status.  This reflects  the high prevalence  
of very low iodine  and very low selenium  herds  in the survey.  While  combined  
very low selenium  and iodine  herd status  occurred  twice  as frequently  as very 
low selenium  status  alone,  22 and 11 herds  respectively,  very low iodine  status  
alone  (32 herds)  was more  frequently  detected  than combined  very low iodine  
and selenium  (22 herds).  This  reflects  the greater  prevalence  of very low iodine  
than very low iodine  and selenium  status  herds  in this study.  While  Rogers  et 
al. (1989)  stated that deficiencies  of trace elements  may arise singly or in 
combination,  there  are no published  data  on the combined  deficiencies  detected  
here in Irish herds.
Herd  copper  status  did not vary greatly  between  spring  and autumn  (Table  
12). This reflects  the fact that at both sampling  periods  cows were generally  
not fed concentrate  ration.  Poole  etal. (1983)  found  that while  herd  copper  status  
declined  during  the summer,  with  higher  values  from  January  to June,  they  noted  
that these data referred  to different  farms  and different  locations  in Kerry  for 
each  monthly  mean  value.  O’ Farrell,  MacCarthy , Crinion  and Sherington  (1986)  
reported  that blood  copper  concentration  declined  from  a peak  in May  to a trough  
in November  in a single  dairy  herd monitored  over a year and a half.  Although  
there  was  considerable  variation  in selenium  status  of herds  between  spring and 
autumn  in this study  (Table  12) normal/marginal  herds  in the spring  tended  to 
remain  so in the autumn  and low/very  low herds  in the spring  tended  to have  
a similar  status  in the autumn.  Poole  et al. (1983)  showed  that selenium  status  
tended  to be relatively  high and rising  in spring  and declined  over the summer  
to a trough  in August  or September.  There  was a trend  in the present  data  towards  
a lower iodine status in the autumn  compared  to the spring (Table  12). 
This  may be  due to differences  in iodine  intake, seasonal  effects  and physiologi ­
cal status.
The finding  that over half of all herds  in the spring  and over three  -quarters  
of all herds in the autumn  were classified  as very low in one or more trace  
elements  is perhaps  surprising  considering  the levels  of physical,  calving  and 
fertility  performance  achieved  on these  farms  (Tables  2, 3,4 and 5). However,  
healthy  herds  often show abnormal  blood  or feed tests (Rogers  et al., 1989),  
hence,  blood  tests alone will not identify  deficient  herds. Diagnosis  of trace  
element  responsive-disorders  should  be based on the presence  of clinical  or 
subclinical  signs  together  with low or very low mineral  status  in blood  and on 
the response  to specific  mineral  supplementation.

Systems  of Beef Production  Using  
Continental  Cross Cattle  from the 
Suckler  Herd
M. J. DRENNAN
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
Where  clearly  demonstrated  financial  benefits  are shown,  beef  farmers  have  
responded by making the necessary changes.  One such  example  in recent  years  
has been the'change  to continental  breeds.  Estimates  made  in the late seventies  
showed  that  only  6 to 8% of the national  calf  crop  were  continental  crosses  which  
increased to 17% in 1985 and 48% in 1993 (Figure  1). In fact, recent  estimates  
(Drennan  and Power,  1993)  show that 84% of mature  suckler  cows and 50% 
of suckler  replacement  heifers  are bred to continental  sire breeds.  This major  
change  in breeding  policy  was  due  to the high  growth  potential  of the continentals  
and the higher  prices  for the better  quality  carcasses,  i.e., leaner  and of good  
conformation  (Keane,  1992).  The introduction  of milk quotas  in 1984 resulted  
in decreased  calf supplies  from the dairy  herd resulting  in increased  calf prices  
which  lead to an increase  in suckler  cow numbers.  This increase  subsequently  
gained  momentum  following  improved  suckler  cow premiums.  As a result,  
suckler  cow numbers  have increased  from  0.44 million  in 1984 to 0.98 million  
in 1993 (Table  1).
While  financial  benefits  could be clearly  shown  for increasing  the use of 
continental  sire breeds  and increasing  suckler  cow numbers  the financial  gain 
to the individual  producer  as a result  of opting  for a specific  production  system  
were not as clear. The main reason  was the uncertainty  and variation  in beef 
prices  throughout  the year. A further  complication  at present  is eligibility  for 
cattle  premiums  which  is influenced  by stocking  rate requirements,  quotas  in 
the case of suckler  cow numbers,  a maximum  of 90 animals  in the case of beef 
premia  and for the slaughter  premium  period  of slaughter  (January  1 to April  
30). In this paper,  it is attempted  to provide  guidelines  for non-disadvantaged  
areas  of optimum  production  systems  for suckler  herds  within  which  the progeny  
are taken  to slaughter  or where  male  progeny  are purchased  at weaning  and taken  
to slaughter.

Distribution  of slaughterings
Before  discussing  details  of systems  it is necessary  to briefly  discuss  the 
impact  of the Common  Agricultural  Policy  Reforms  (1992). These  reforms  will 
involve  a reduction  in intervention  purchases  and lower  intervention  prices.  This 
will be offset  by increased  payments  directly  to farmers  in the form  of the various  
premia.  Because  of the high proportion  of Irish beef which  must be exported  
and the distance  from the main markets  of Europe,  Ireland  has relied  heavily  
on intervention  in the past.  In the future,  a greater  proportion  of beef  will have  
to be marketed  directly  rather  than through  intervention.  For orderly  marketing  
a relatively  even supply  of beef  throughout  the year is important.  While  heifer  
and cow slaughterings  at meat export  premises  have been relatively  evenly  
spread  throughout  the year there has been a pronounced  seasonality  in steer  
slaughterings with a  larger  proportion  in autumn  (Figure  2). In fact the position  
has deteriorated  over the years in that 32% were slaughtered  in the October/  
December  period  in the years 1973 to 1978, while  the corresponding  figures  
were  37% for the years 1979  to 1984,47%  for 1985 to 1990 and 41%  for 1991 
and 1992.  Economic  factors  were  the major  reasons  for this change.  Intervention,  
aids to private  storage  (APS)  and export  refunds  in recent  years ensured  a 
satisfactory  price  for finished  animals  in autumn  and resulted  in an escalation  
in store  prices  thereby  reducing  the economic  returns  from  winter  finishing.  The 
slaughter  premium  payable  on steers  slaughtered  during  the first four months  
of the year  should  improve  the distribution  of steer  slaughterings  but if removed  
there is the danger  of a return  to the original  position.
Suckler  cow systems
The systems  examined  are based  on Grange  data using  Limousin  x Friesian  
cows.  Sires  of the larger  continental  breeds  (Charolais)  are used  on mature  cows  
and easy calving  Limousin  sires on heifers.  High quality  silage  (ensiled  May 
20 to 27, DMD  74%)  is fed to the progeny  in winter  while  cows  receive  lower  
quality material  (ensiled  late July,  DMD  64%).  Cows  are fed a mineral/vitamin  
supplement  with silage  in winter.
Three  spring  calving  systems  are compared  and high animal  performance  
is assumed.  In each system  heifers  are taken  to slaughter  at 20 months  of age. 
The systems  involve  different  slaughter  ages for the male progeny.
The systems  are:
steers  slaughtered  at 24 months,  1.9 acres (0.77 ha) of 
grassland  per cow unit
steers slaughtered  at 29 months,  2.2 acres (0.89 ha) of 
grassland  per cow unit
bulls slaughtered  at 16 months,  1.6 acres (0.65 ha) of 
grassland  per cow unit
All systems  are at a similar  stocking  density  and the total input  of nitrogenous  
fertiliser  is approximately  95 kg per acre (235 kg per ha). In system  A, steers  
are finished  at the end of their second  winter,  whereas  in system  B, steers  are 
put to grass  for a third  grazing  season.  In system  C, young  bulls  are slaughteredA. (Steers  24 m)

following  an extended  winter  feeding  period  of 8 months.  Daily concentrate  
feeding  levels  are: 1 kg for weanlings  (steers  and heifers),  4.5 kg for young  bulls,  
4 kg for finishing  steers  and 3 kg for finishing  heifers.  Where  steers  are let to 
pasture  for a third  grazing  season  (system  B) no concentrates  are fed during  the 
second  winter  period.
Carcass  weight  (kg) of males  for systems  A, B and C are 390, 420 and 350 
kg, respectively.  Heifers  in all systems  have  carcass  weights  of 300 kg. Carcass  
prices  are 229.3  and 220.5  p/kg  for males  and heifers,  respectively.  This  assumes  
that young  bulls obtain  a similar  price to steers  and that there is no effect  of 
time of year when slaughtered  on price obtained.
The premia  payable  for each system  are those  applicable  in 1994  and amount  
to £113,  £84 and £93 per acre for systems  A, B and C, respectively  (Table  2). 
In addition  to the suckler  cow premium,  system  A receives  the beef  premium  
for males  at 10 and 22 months  of age and the slaughter  premium,  system  B 
receives  the beef  premium  at 10 and 22 months  while system C  (bulls)  receives  
only  the beef  premium  at 10 months.  The  extensification  premium  is not included  
for any system.  As actual  grass  acreage  is used, it is reasonable  to assume  that 
on most  farms  this amounts  to about  90% of map acres.  Using  this adjustment  
the stocking  rates  for all three  systems  are below  the 0.81 livestock  units (L.U.)  
per acre (2 L.U. per ha) necessary  for premia  in the final (1996)  eligibility  
specifications.  It is noticeable  that with inclusion  of replacements  the stocking  
rate of system  B would  approach  eligibility  for the extensification  premium.  
It is assumed  that the premia  shown  are actually  obtained  and in this respect  
there is very little freedom  regarding  the 22 month  beef premium  and the 
slaughter  premium  when animals  are slaughtered  at 2 years (System  A).
Interest  is charged  on all working  capital  but no charge  for housing  or labour  
is included  in the calculations.  Inclusion  of the slaughter  premium  for steers

slaughtered  at 24 months  results  in similar  incomes  per cow unit for the two 
steer  systems,  but higher  income  per acre (£170  v £146)  from  the 24 month  than 
from the 29 month  steer system  (Table  3). The outcome  would  be similar  in 
the absence  of the slaughter  premium  if there was a price  differential  of 15 p/ 
kg of carcass  for steers  slaughtered  in March  above  that for steers  slaughtered  
in the July/September  period.  The bull system  (C) had a considerably  lower  
income  per cow than the other  two systems  and an income  per acre of £142.  
However,  with a fixed cow quota  and assuming  that land is not limiting  then 
the bull system  would  result  in reduced  premia  (no 22 month  beef  premium  or 
slaughter  premium)  and lower  total income  on a farm basis.
Total  costs  per kg of liveweight  and carcass  weight  produced  are shown  in 
Table  4. Due to differences  in killing-out  percentage,  carcass  weight  provides  
a better  assessment  than liveweight.  The system  (B) producing  steers at 29 
months  of age produced  beef at lower  cost per kg than the other  two systems.  
This is expected  as concentrate  inputs  (and costs)  were lower  for this system  
although  interest  on animals  were  higher  as animals  were retained  for a longer  
period.  The higher  premia  for the 24 month  system  (received  the slaughter  
premium)  resulted  in higher  incomes  from the spring system  (System  A). 
Therefore,  while  grass  finishing  systems  with  lower  variable  costs  result  in lower  
costs  per kg of carcass  produced  cattle  prices  and premia  also have  a major  effect  
on incomes  and in this instance  more than offset  the higher  production  costs.

Weaning  to slaughter  systems  for steers  or bulls
Many producers  purchase  suckled  weanlings  and take them through  to 
slaughter.  Assuming  similar  slaughter  ages, weights  and prices  as shown  for 
systems  A, B and C the grassland  area required  for systems  Al (steers  24 
months),  B1 (steers  29 months)  and Cl (bulls 16 months)  from weaning  at 8 
months  of age to slaughter  are 1.0 (0.40),  1.6 (0.65)  and 0.27 (0.11)  acres  (ha), 
respectively.  While  both steer systems  qualify  for the total premia  in 1994 at 
both the 10 and 22 months  only 60% of bulls  qualify  for the 10 month  premium  
(1.21 livestock  units per acre) assuming  no other  animals  are available  on the 
farm and actual  rather  than adjusted  acres  are used.  It is assumed  that steers  and 
bulls are purchased  at 300 kg liveweight  at a cost of £480 per head.
The incomes  per acre are £174,  £107 and £141 for steers  slaughtered  at 24 
months  (Al),  steers  slaughtered  at 29 months  (Bl) and bulls slaughtered  at 16 
months  (Cl), respectively  (Table 5). The results again indicate  the better

sale price  is used  both  of which  have  a substantial  effect  on comparable  incomes.  
Changing  the sale price  by 10 p/kg  of carcass  changes  incomes  per acre by £39, 
£26 and £130 from weanling  to beef systems  Al, Bl and Cl, respectively.  
Likewise,  changing  purchase  price  would  have a far greater  effect  on incomes  
per acre from the bull system  than from the two steer systems.
Total  costs  per kg of carcass  gain is £1.98,  £1.80  and £1.78  for systems  Al, 
Bl and Cl, respectively  (Table  6). This again  shows  that production  costs are

only one factor  in determining  income  as despite  the higher  cost per kg gain 
steers  slaughtered  at 24 months  give a considerably  higher  income  per acre than 
the other two systems.
In 1996, the special  beef premium  will be increased  to £87.9  per head on 
each occasion  and stocking  rate requirements  will be 0.81 LU per acre. An 
examination  of incomes  for the three  weanling  to beef  systems  for 1996 shows  
that 74% of the animals  in the 24 month  steer  system  and only 40%  of the bulls  
would  qualify.  In these  circumstances,  the 24 month  old steer  system  would  still 
provide  the highest  income  per acre  while  the difference  between  systems  would  
be reduced  (Table  7). The bull system  would  give the lowest  income  per acre. 
As an indication  of the importance  of the beef  premium  and its effects  on system  
comparisons  the total  premia  per acre  from  the weanling  to beef  systems  in 1996  
amounts  to £189,  £110 and £130 for systems  Al, Bl and Cl when only 74% 
of the animals  in system  Al and 40% in system  Cl qualified  for premia  due to 
stocking  rate limitations.  However,  if all animals  were eligible  for premia  then 
the corresponding  total premia  for 1996 would  be £234,  £110 and £326.  The 
higher  premia  payments  could  be achieved  if there were animals  produced  on 
the farm which  are not eligible  for premia  (and are thus not included  in the LU 
calculations)  such as heifers.
Conclusions  !
1. The various  beef premia  have a major  effect  on beef incomes.
2. In  both  suckling  to beef  and weaning  to beef  systems,  inclusion  of the winter  
slaughter  premium  (for animals  slaughtered  between  January  1 and April  
30) results  in higher  incomes  from the 24 month  steer system.
3. Higher  sale prices (or cheaper  weanlings)  have a far greater  effect on 
incomes  from the young  bull system  than from the two steer systems.
4. In both suckling  to beef  systems  and weanling  to beef  systems  the cost per 
kg of carcass  was lower  for the 29 month  than for the 24 month  system,  
although  incomes  were higher  for the latter.  This shows  that in addition  
to production  costs animal  prices  and premia  are important  determinants  
of profitability.
48
5. The spring  slaughter  premium  improves  the profitability  of winter  finishing  
and as a result  leads  to a better  distribution  of slaughterings  throughout  the 
year.  Higher  cattle  prices  in spring  than later  in the year would  have  similar  
effects.

Farm  profile
The farm consists  of 500 acres  (300 adjusted)  in four divisions.  Herding  the 
four divisions  involves  a round  trip of twenty  four miles.  Of the 250 acres in 
the home  farm only 55 acres  can be cut.  This is cut twice;  30 acres  are also cut 
twice  on one of the outside  farms.  Due to the limited  amount  of land suitable  
for cutting  it is important  to graze extra  cattle  in summertime.  This is one of 
the reasons  for opting  for a 2.5 year old cattle system.

A slatted  house  was built  on the farm in 1978. A slatted  house  for cows  on 
the home  farm and a slatted  cattle house  on an outside  farm were completed  
by 1988. All cattle  are now housed  on slats.
Over 100 acres  of the home  farm have been  drained  and developed  over  the 
years.
Clare  Leader  now proposes  to fund a pilot project  proposed  by Clare  Marts  
to improve  the quality  of cows and bulls in suckler  herds.
I believe  that beef now has to be produced  for the real markets  and that 
intervention  specification  should  not influence  anyone  when planning  their  
longterm  breeding  programme.  We have  already  seen  Intervention  become  less 
attractive  to factories  and I expect  we will have little or no meat going  to this 
outlet  in a few years time. My programme  is planned  to produce  very large  
lean animals  that will give carcase  weights  of 440 - 500 kg and Grade  U.
Niche  Market
With  the very high price  of top quality  calves  and weanlings  it makes  sense  
to carry  them  to high weights  provided  they have  the potential  to do this without  
getting  too fat. I have got a premium  for this type of animal  over the last few 
years. The market  for heavy Lf Grade  carcases  is a niche market  and will 
probably  remain  so but I believe  that there will be a market  for animals  that 
produce  large quantities  of good quality  uniform  lean meat.
Seasonality
Due to my farm structure  much  of my production  is geared  towards  autumn 
slaughtering.  This has been very satisfactory  in the past when  intervention  was
50
open ended  and provided  an outlet  for all the beef  that came  on the market.  I 
now think that I will have to plan to spread  my slaughtering  over the year or 
at least move it away from the autumn  glut.
Development  of suckler  enterprise
In the mid-eighties  I had 30 suckler  cows;  mainly  Hereford  X with a few 
Angus  X and Continental  X. These  were  crossed  with a Simmental  bull. I also 
reared  30 calves  and bought  in about 100 stores  each year. At that stage  the 
calves  were Hereford  X, Friesian  and Continental  X. These  were satisfactory  
but the declining  quality  and high  prices  of the calves  available  and the demand  
for higher  quality  in the market  place  pushed  me into  breeding  more  of my own  
cattle.
The numbers  were increased  by buying  in some Angus  heifer  calves  and 
Angus  breeding  heifers.  These  were  crossed  with  a good  Simmental  bull (except  
for first calvers).  The best heifers  from this herd were kept for breeding.
Two herds
I now have two herds.  The old Hereford  X and  Angus  X herd now produces  
replacements  for the main herd. This herd is grazed  on a wet peaty  area of the 
farm.
The main herd consists  almost  completely  of Simmental  X cows  bred on the 
farm.  These  are crossed  with a large  muscular  Charolais  bull specially  selected  
to breed  large  fast growing  cattle  with  good  conformation.  This  herd  is still being  
expanded.
Calving  difficulty
In spring  of 1992 the first Charolais  calves  were born. The cows had been 
on high  quality  silage  with  little or no rationing.  The calves  were  very large and 
we had many difficult  calvings  with five losses.
In 1993 silage  quality  was poorer  and some moderate  quality  hay was also 
fed. The feed was also rationed.  The result  was that only one calf was lost at 
calving  from 50 calvings.
Plans  for the future
The final size of the cow herd will depend  on the price of store cattle  over 
the next  few years.  I would  not rule out buying  quota  to keep extra  cows.  More  
buildings  will be required  if the cow herd is increased.
There  is also more reclamation  to be carried  out.
I expect  to get the bullocks  now coming  from the Charolais  bull to reach  
850 kg at 2.5 years and the heifers  up to 650 kg at 2 years.

in Scotland

Introduction
Beef  from the suckler  herd accounts  for two-thirds  of overall  Scottish  beef 
production,  unlike  the UK where  suckler  herds account  for only one-third  of 
beef  supplies.  The importance  of the suckler  herd  in Scotland  may  partly  explain  
the reputation  Scotch  beef has developed  as a quality  product  in overseas  
markets.  Certainly  the export  of prime  Scottish  beef plays a significant  part 
in maintaining  higher  prices  for finished  cattle  in Scotland  compared  with the 
rest of the UK. In addition,  the recent  increase  in exports  has revived  competi ­
tiveness  in the Scottish  beef market  which  previously  was increasingly  being  
dominated  by the five main UK supermarkets.
Two aspects  have been important  in successfully  marketing  Scottish  beef. 
First  its perceived  high  eating  quality  - beef  with  excellent  eating  quality  is never  
expensive  whatever  it costs. The second  has been the "naturalness  and whole ­
someness"  of Scottish  beef  - suckled  calf production  being  based  in the scenic  
Scottish  hills and uplands  and recently  reinforced  with the introduction  of a 
Scottish  Farm Assured  Scheme  - FASL.
The general  specification  for Scotch  beef exports  is :
* steers  or heifers
* under  30 months  of age
* 280-340  kg carcass  weight
* carcass  conformation  R or better
* fat class 4L
The  overall  philosophy  in exporting  Scotch  beef  has been  to provide  a unique,  
labelled,  top quality  product  which  cannot  be provided  elsewhere,  rather  than 
the conventional  approach  of exporting  a product  which  other  countries  already  
produce  themselves.
To meet  these  specifications,  particularly  in terms  of high eating  quality  and 
good  conformation,  even  well  bred  suckled  calves  must  remain  healthy  through ­
out their life. For the suckled  calf  the most  common  cause  of ill health  occurs  
post weaning,  particularly  infectious  diseases  such as pneumonia.
Trials  monitoring  the effect  of pneumonia  in an intensive  bull beef system  
show that as well as reducing  lifetime  performance,  i.e. growth  rate and food 
conversion,  pneumonia  has an equally  expensive  effect  in reducing  eventual  
carcass  conformation.
The weaning  check
After  birth,  weaning  is the next most  traumatic  day in the life of the suckled  
calf. In many cases all aspects  of the calfs life changes  completely  in a few
52
short  hours  - its diet, its environment  and its social contacts!  As a  consequence  
most  calves,  if they are lucky  , lose 1-2 months  performance  and the ones who 
aie unlucky get pneumonia!  Fortunately,  careful  management  around  weaning  
can minimise  the weaning  check,  maintain  calf performance  and minimse  the 
risk of pneumonia  with benefits  in the eventual  quality  of the carcass  they 
produce.
As with any disease,  the two important  aspects  to consider  with pneumonia  
are the resistance  of the animal  and the level of infection  to which  it is exposed.  
Effectively,  this simply  means minimising  the weaning  check. Important  
management  points  to consider  are;
1. Age at weaning.  The older/heavier  the calf is at weaning  the less the 
weaning  check  will be.
For example,  for calves  growing  at 1 kg/head/day,  at 3 months  of age the 
calf might  be drinking  9 kg of milk/day  which  would  represent  65% of its 
total energy  intake. In comparison  a 9 month  old calf might only be 
receiving  4 kg of milk/day  equivalent  to only  20% of its total daily  energy  
intake. As a general  rule of thumb  calves  should  NOT he weaned  until 
they are over 5 months  old or over 200 kg liveweight.
2. The importance  of milk. Milk is a unique  feed  for the calf, going  directly  
into its own  "special  stomach"  the abomasum.  All other  feed goes into the  
main stomach  - the rumen. Hence  the more milk calves  are drinking  pre 
weaning,  the less normal  feed (grass,  concentrates,  etc.) they have to eat 
to maintain  liveweight  gains  of around  1 kg/day and  the smaller  their  rumen  
capacity.  As a consequence  the day after  the calf is weaned  its feed intake  
is limited  by its restricted  rumen  capacity  so that in many cases energy  
intakes  are only  sufficient  to maintain  the calf with no energy  available  for 
growth.  Research  shows  that in general  it can take up to about  2 months  
for the rumen  to expand  sufficiently  for weaned  calves  to have normal  dry 
matter  intakes.
The way to overcome  the initial low intake  of weaned  suckled  calves  is 
to feed  a ration  with  a high  energy  concentration  immediately  post  weaning.  
As a general  rule  of thumb,  for weaned  spring  born  calves  wintered  on silage  
rations,  a minimum  of I'h kg of concentrates/head/day  should  be fed post 
weaning.
As the dry matter  intake  of the calf increases  during  the 3 months  after  
weaning  the energy  concentration  of the ration  can gradually  be reduced,  
e.g. concentrate  supplementation  gradually  reduced  to around  only 1 kg/ 
head/day  and still maintain  liveweight  gain. In many  situations  this high/  
low level of concentrate  feeding  results in similar  overall  concentrate  
intakes  over the winter  but can improve  total winter  gains by around  30 
kg/head.
3. Creep  feeding  pre weaning.  Abrupt  weaning  and housing  of spring  born 
suckled  calves  means  a complete  change  in their diet - pre weaning  they 
will be receiving  milk  and grass  and post weaning  silage  and possibly  some  
concentrates.  This abrupt  change  is a major  stress to the calf - it has to
53
4.find where  the new feed is "hidden",  has to get accustomed  to eating  the 
new feeds  as do the bugs in its rumen  which  research  work has  shown  will 
take 2 to 3 weeks  to adjust  fully to the new diet. This stress  is made  worse  
with calves  likely  to be short of feed (grass)  pre weaning.
Trials  investigating  creep  feeding  spring  born  calves  shows  that introducing  
supplementary  concentrates  approximately  2 months  pre weaning  increases  
calf  weaning  weights  by around  25 kg/head  and improves  overall  perform ­
ance  during  the following  winter  with the calves  having  been acclimatised  
to at least  one of their  subsequent  winter  feeds. Creep  feeding  is therefore  
the basis of a successful  weaning  programme  for spring  born calves.
It also has the advantage  that calves  will regulate  their intake  of creep  
depending  on grass supplies  - if adequate  grass (a target  grass height  of 9 
cm) is available  calves  will graze  rather  than eat creep.
Clipping  the backs  of weaned  calves. In the autumn  cattle  begin  to grow  
their  winter  coat, yet the majority  of weaned  calves  will be housed  indoors  
over  the winter.  In this situation  the biggest  problem  facing  cattle  is keeping  
cool, not keeping  warm!
Cattle  like humans,  control  their  body  temperature  by sweating,  particularly  
along  their back. However  with a full winter  coat it is difficult  for sweat  
to evaporate  so that body temperatures  rise, again stressing  the animal. 
Simply  clipping  the back  of weaned  calves  at housing  enables  them  to sweat  
freely  and hence  maintain  a more constant  body temperature,  helping  to 
minimise  the risk of pneumonia.
Trials  in the north of Scotland  showed  that simply  clipping  the backs  of 
weaned  calves  increased  overall  winter  gains by 7 kg/head.
Reducing  the infection  to which  the weaned  calf is exposed
1. Reducing  relative  humidity
Most of the pneumonia-causing  organisms  are airborne  so that animals  
become  infected  by breathing  in the organisms.  Hence  how long these  
organisms  survive  in the air will determine  the level of infection  animals  
breathe  in. The moisture  content  of the air is critical  to the survival  of these  
organisms.  Research  work has shown  that in damp  air (relative  humidity  
above  75%) their life-span  is many hours whereas  in a dry atmosphere  
(below  75% relative  humidity)  their life-span  is much  shorter,  in terms  of 
minutes  rather  than hours. This is why pneumonia  is a major  problem  in 
damp,  muggy  weather.
To minimise  the risk of pneumonia  it is therefore  essential  that buildings  
are kept  as dry as possible  and this is the main function  of good  ventilation.  
It is probably  true to say that the majority,  if not all, cattle buildings  are 
under-ventilated.  The principle  to successfully  ventilating  cattle  buildings  
is to get as much  air change  as possible  over  the heads  of the cattle  without  
draughts  occurring  amongst  the cattle. One method  for improving  the 
ventilation  of existing  buildings  which has been successfully  used in 
Scotland  over recent  years has been slotting  of roofs.
54
2. Frequent  bedding
One way of helping  to reduce  moisture  levels  in buildings  soon after  cattle  
are housed  is to bed them frequently.  Hence,  most Scottish  producers  
housing  cattle  in straw  yards  now bed  weaned calves  daily for the first one 
to 2 weeks  after  they are weaned.  Producers  in Northern  Ireland  have  taken  
this a step further  and actually  bed slatted  pens for weaned  calves  for the 
first 2 to 3 weeks  of the winter.
3. Stocking  rates
The level of infection  an animal  faces depends  on how much  infection  is 
being  produced  around  about  it. An animal  housed  by itself  is most  unlikely  
to suffer  from  pneumonia  whereas  animals  heavily  stocked  are most  at risk. 
Ideally  therefore  newly  weaned  calves  should  be housed  at as low a stocking  
rate as possible  - stocking  rates  can gradually  be increased  once  the calves  
are fully settled  down  and have got over the worst  of the weaning  check.  
In slatted  buildings  this could  be reasonably  easily  achieved  by initially  only 
stocking  every  other  pen and utilising  other  sheds,  e.g. buildings  which  will 
eventually  house  dry cows.
It is not only the level of infection  but also the type of infection  to which  
weaned  calves  are exposed  which  influence  the risk of pneumonia.
Pneumonia  organisms  are commonly  found  in all situations  so that during  
the suckling  period  calves  will have  developed  some  resistance  to the organisms  
they have come in contact  with. However  should  they be faced with new 
organisms  to which  they have no resistance  when  they are being  stressed,  i.e. 
post weaning,  then there is a real risk of pneumonia  occurring.  To avoid  this 
occurring  :
1. Don  'tmix  stock  in the same  building.  Ideally  newly  weaned  suckled  calves  
should  be housed  by themselves  in a separate  building.  The exception  to 
this would  be housing  weaned  calves  alongside  the mature  cows who, in 
general,  are reasonably  resistant  to pneumonia  and do not produce  large  
levels  of infection.  The  common  problem  on many  farms  is to house  newly  
weaned  calves  in the same  shed as the "tail end" calves  from the previous  
year. Often  these tail end calves  also had pneumonia  earlier  in their life 
and hence  are an ideal source  of infection  to this year ’s crop of weaned  
calves.
2. Don't  mix with purchased  stock. The other major  risk is mixing  newly 
weaned  homebred  calves  with purchased  stock. In this situation  it will 
almost  be essential  to vaccinate  both purchased  animals  and homebred  
calves. To ensure  the homebred  calves  have developed  full resistance  
before  they are challenged,  it is essential  that the vaccination  programme  
is carried  out pre weaning  at grass.
Conclusions
To successfully  market  beef it is essential  that it has high eating  quality  to 
give maximum  consumer  satisfaction.  An important  component  in achieving  
this objective  is to maintain  a high  health status  throughout  the animal's  lifetime.
Careful  planning  the weaning  programme  can:
55
ensure  that the major  cause  of ill health  in suckled  calves  is avoided,  with 
considerable  benefits,  both to the efficiency  and hence  profitability  of the 
system.
ensuring  a high value  carcass  which  can compete  in terms  of eating  quality  
with the wide range  of other foods available  to the modern  consumer.

Increasing  Reproductive  Efficiency  in 
Suckler  Herds
M. G. DISKIN
Teagasc,  Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam, Co. Galway.
Both the biological  and economic  efficiency  of suckler  herds depend  on 
calving  the cows  at the optimum  time  each  year, on the cow’s reproductive  rate, 
one calf per cow per year and on the rate of gain of the calf. Reproductive  
efficiency  is, clearly,  very important.
In terms  of reproduction  suckler  cows  are distinctly  different  to dairy cows  
in a number  of important  aspects.  Firstly,  the interval  from calving  to the 
resumption  of cycles  or first heat averages  about  60 days for suckler  cows as 
opposed  to about  30 days for dairy cows.  This long interval  from calving  to 
resumption  of cyclicity  has serious  implications  for maintaining  a 365 day 
calving  interval.  Secondly,  because  of the suckling  effect  of the calf  and indeed  
the presence  of the calves,  suckler  cows  display  less intense  signs  of behaviourial  
heat thus making  heat detection  very difficult  for farmers  who use A.I. These  
and other factors  that affect  herd reproductive  performance  are discussed.
Reproductive  targets
The reproductive  targets  for a suckler  herd are: 1) 90% of the cows should  
calve  in 80 days,  2) less than  5% of cows  should  be culled  for reproductive  failure  
and, 3) the calving-to-calving  interval  should  not exceed  365 days. Good  
management  is required  in order  to achieve  these targets.
Areas  for improving  reproductive  efficiency
In suckler  herds  there  are 3 potential  areas  to improve  reproductive  efficiency  
viz., shortening  the interval  from calving  to first heat, 2) improving  heat 
detection  efficiency  and 3) improving  cow conception  rate.
Interval  between  calving  and resumption  of cycles
The interval  from calving  to first heat (post-partum  interval)  largely  deter ­
mines  the likelihood  of cows becoming  pregnant  during  a compact  breeding  
season.  There are a number  of key physiological  factors  resulting  from the 
suckling  effect  of the calf and from interactions  between  the cow and her calf 
that affect  herd reproductive  efficiency.  A better  understanding  of how these  
factors  operate  is being  obtained  from experiments  at Belclare.  The results  of 
experiments  on cows in poor  body  condition  at calving  and on different  levels  
of post-calving  nutrition,  suckling  restriction  and cow-calf  interaction  are 
presented  in Table 1. In these indoor  experiments  suckling  restriction  (once  
daily)  and/or  cow-calf  isolation  were  started  30 days after  calving.  The experi ­
mental  cows were allowed  to be suckled  once per day starting  30 days after  
calving.  When  cyclicity  was resumed  calves  were  returned  to full-time  access.

Restricting  suckling  frequency  while the cows were adjacent  to the other  
cows  and calves  shortened  the post partum  interval  by 15 days (from  78 to 63 
days).  The combination  of restricting  suckling  frequency  and of isolating  the 
cows  from  their  calves  shortened  the post-partum  interval  by 24 days.  In a further  
experiment  with cows  in different  body condition  scores  at calving,  restricted  
suckling  combined  with calf isolation  also significantly  shortened  the post­
partum  interval  (see Table  2) with the greatest  effect  seen in cows that were  
in poor body score (1.75)  at calving.

It is clear  irrespective  of factors  such  as feeding  level  or body  condition  score  
at calving  that the suckling  process  itself  contributes  significantly  to the delay  
in resumption  of cylicity  in suckler  cows.  Furthermore,  there  appears  to be two 
components  to the suckling  effects  1) the direct  stimulus  of the teat or udder  
when the calf suckles  the cow and 2) non-tactile  stimulation  (visual,  auditory  
or olfactory  cues)  from the calf, or indeed  other  calves  or other  adjacent  cows  
being suckled.
58
The other  major  factor  that effects  resumption  of cyclicity  is nutrition  and 
is currently  the major  focus  of the Belclare  programme.  Nutrition,  particularly  
pre-partum,  has important  implications  when cows resume  cyclicity  after 
calving  (see Table 2). In the ad libitum  group,  the cows in the lowest  body  
condition  at calving  had the long intervals  (71 days) compared  with cows in 
moderate  (59 days)  and good  (55 days)  body condition  score.  These  and other  
experiments  clearly  indicate  that  cows  should  cal  ve in a moderate  body  condition  
score  and post-calving  weight  losses  should  be minimised.  Suckler  cows  should  
be body condition  scored  on a regular  basis before  calving  and cows in poor  
condition  or losing  body  condition  should  be selected  out for additional  feeding.
Heat  detection
Nearly  half of all suckler  cows are now bred by A.I. the success  of which  
is dependent  on achieving  both high and accurate  heat  detection  rates.  Because  
the average  duration  of standing  heat is short, at about  9 hours,  and because  
the signs  of heat  are less intense, heat  detection  is more  difficult  in suckler  cows  
than in either  dairy cows or heifers.  Successful  heat detection  requires  firstly  
that the farmer  clearly  recognises  the signs  of heat, and secondly  has a definite  
commitment  to at least  3 heat  checks  daily  for the duration  of the breeding  period.  
These  cheeks  must  be carried  out early  morning  and late evening  because  these  
are the times  of greatest  heat activity.
Signs  of heat
1. Standing  to be mounted  by herd mate or bull is the most definite  sign.
2. Discharge  of clear mucus:  this originates  in the uterus and is a good  
indication  of imminent  heat.
3. Restlessness  and  mounting  behaviour:  signs of restlessness  are character ­
istic of individual  cows that are either  approaching  or are in heat.
4. Swelling  of vulva:  hormonal  changes  associated  with heat cause an in­
creased  blood supply  to the reproductive  organs  which in turn causes  
swelling  and reddening  of the vulva.
5. Hair  loss and  dirt  marks:  as a result  of continuous  mounting  by herd mates,  
the hair on the tailhead  is usually  removed  and the skin on either  side of 
the tail-head  is often scarred  and dirty.
6. Blood  stains  on the tail or vulval  area are indicative  of a recent  heat.
Techniques  which  may  be of assistance  to improve  heat  detection  efficiency  
Tail-painting:  This works  well in dairy  cows  but is more  variable  in suckler  
cows.  Due to the lower  intensity  of heat activity  there  is less complete  removal  
of paint.
Teaser:  Active,  vasectomized  or teaser  bulls  can be useful  in identifying  cows  
either  coming  into  or on heat. However,  there  is considerable  variation  in libido  
among  bulls and they require  the same management  as full bulls without  any 
of the advantages.
59
Steers:  Steers,  particularly  if recently  castrated,  can be useful  in identifying  
cows coming  into or on heat.
Calf  removal:  The presence  of the calf  reduces  the intensity  of heat as well 
as delaying  the onset  of cycles.  Restricting  suckling  frequency  to either  once  
or twice  per day for a period  of 14 to 20 days may be an option  to both initiate  
cyclicity  and increase  the signs of heat activity  thus facilitating  detection  and 
the A.I. of a higher  proportion  of cows early in the season.  This may not be 
readily  practical  but in acute situations  for example  with late calving  cows,  
young  cows  or with  cows  in poor  body  condition  at calving  this may  be an option  
worth  considering.  Wliere  this approach  is contemplated,  to either  hasten  the 
onset  of cyclicity  or to improve  the behavioral  signs of heat, cows should  be 
separated  not only from their own calves  but also from other cows and their  
calves.
Heat  synchronisation
Control  of the cycle,  or synchronisation  as it is popularly  known,  combined  
with fixed time A.I. can reduce  the amount  of heat checking,  allow  A.I. at a 
preplanned  time and induce  earlier  resumption  of cycles  after calving.  There  
are two categories  of synchronisation  treatment.
1) Prostaglandins:  These  are only effective  in cyclic  cows  and are incapable  
of inducing  cyclicity.  Because  a high  proportion  of suckler  cows  are likely  
to be non-cyclic  prostaglandin  treatment  is not recommended.
2) Progestagens:  PRIDs  (Sanofi)  and Crestar  ear implants  (Intervet))  are 
capable  of inducing  cyclicity  in a proportion  of cows as well as synchro ­
nising  heat and are the treatments  of choice  for suckler  cows.
Advantages  of synchronisation  in breeding  management
Synchronisation  has certain  benefits  in tenns  of shortening  the calving-to-  
conception  interval,  achieving  more  compact  calving,  reducing  the amount  of 
heat detection  and facilitating  A.I. thus giving  access  to proven  sires.
Shortening  the calving-to-conception  interval:  In herds with a seasonal  
calving  pattern  late calving  cows do not have sufficient  time and opportunity  
to become  pregnant  within  a restricted  breeding  season.  Because  of this, more  
late calving  than  early  calving  cows  are culled  for infertility.  Treating  individual  
late calving  cows with a progestagen  (PRID  or Crestar  Implant)  can induce  
ovarian  cyclicity  and reduce  the calving-to-service  and conception  intervals.  
Late calvers  can be treated  with a PRID  or Crestar  implant  from Day 30 after 
calving  to allow  A.I. from 41 days after calving.  While  the conception  rate at 
this early stage post-partum  is low, nevertheless  it still leaves  2 further  repeat  
opportunities  for successful  A.I. within  an 83-day  period,  the time required  for 
the cow to calve within 12 months.  This would  reduce  the culling  rate for 
apparent  infertility.  In herds already  using A.I. individual  cows not observed  
in heat,  due to missed  heat  or true anoestrum,  may be treated  with  either  a PRID  
or Crestar  implant.
Compact  calving:  One of the potential  benefits  envisaged  initially  was
60
synchronisation  of groups  of cows,  particularly  in herds  with  a scattered  calving  
pattern.  Because  cows  should  be calved  35 days  before  treatment  the proportion  
of cows  available  on any given  day is restricted  necessitating  the treatment  of 
groups  of cows at intervals.  Thus,  where  the requirement  is greatest,  the role 
for synchronisation  is least effective.
Reducing  the amount  of  heat  detection:  Inability  to accurately  detect  a high 
proportion  of cows in heat leads to disappointing  conception  rates and to the 
use of A.I. for a longer  period  than  should  be necessary.  If efficient  heat  detection  
is not possible  an alternative  strategy  would  be to synchronise  all cows  calved  
at least 35 days at the start of the breeding  period  which  would  allow fixed-  
time A.I. without  reference  to heat. Most of the repeat  heats would  fall over 
a confined  period,  facilitating  heat detection.  However,  as already  indicated,  
if detection  of repeats  is poor any advantage  will be easily  lost. An alternative  
strategy  would  be to introduce  a bull to cover  late and repeat  heats.  However,  
for a  small  number  of cows  the economics  of such a system  would  be doubtful.
Disadvantages  of synchronisation
1) It is important  to realise that treatment  for oestrous  cycle control  
necessitates  assembly  of animals  up to four  times,  viz., for progestagen  insertion  
and removal  or for two prostaglandin  injections  and again  for two fixed-time  
A.I.s. This requires  good basic cattle handling  facilities.
2) Both  Crestar  ear implants  and PRIDs  cost approximately  £8-10  per cow  
treated  plus a veterinary  call fee. The actual  cost may depend  on the number  
of cows to be synchronised.
3) Where  reproductive  efficiency  is already  low because  of underlying  causes  
such  as poor  nutrition,  synchronisation  treatments  will not improve  fertility  until 
the underlying  causes  are corrected.  Synchronisation  treatments  are only suc­
cessful  when used with good management.  They must always  be considered  
as an aid and never  as a substitute  for good breeding  management.
Factors  affecting  conception  rate
Even when heat detection  and A.I. are properly  carried  out, a significant  
amount  of reproductive  wastage  still occurs.  On average  only 55%-60%  of 
inseminations  (natural  or artificial)  result  in the birth  of a calf. This low calving  
rate is seldom  caused  by fertilisation,  rather  is due to death of the embryo  at 
a later  stage. When  embryo  death  occurs  before  the time  of maternal  recognition  
of pregnancy  at days 16-17  after breeding  the cow repeats  at between  18 and 
24 days after breeding.  However,  when  death  of the embryo  occurs  later than 
16 or 17 days  after  breeding,  repeat  occur  at long  and irregular  intervals.  Between  
days 50 days and 8 months  after  breeding  the incidence  of foetal  loss is about  
5-8%.
A number  of factors  are known  to affect  calving  rate including  calving-to-  
service  interval,  accuracy  of heat detection,  level of nutrition  and many  others.
Calving-to-service  interval:  Calving  rate reaches  a normal 60%  in cows  bred 
at 60 or more  days after calving.  When  cows are bred at 40 days or less after
61
calving  or indeed  at their  first post-calving  heat conception  rate is as low as 20-  
40%.  Clearly,  it is essential  that cows  return  to cyclicity  as quickly  as possible  
after calving  in order  to be inseminated  at their second  or subsequent  insemi ­
nation.
Heat  detection  accuracy:  Unless  the cow submitted  for A.I. is in “true” heat 
there is no chance  of conception.  Accuracy  of heat detection  is a problem  in 
herds.  Even in some  dairy  herds  up to 20% of cows submitted  for A.I. are not 
in “true” heat.
Timing  of  A.I: Calving  rate is highest  following  A.I. at 12-18 hours  after  
heat onset  but not greatly  reduced  following  early A.I. However,  A.I. (e.g.,  24 
hours  after onset  of standing  heat) should  be avoided.
Calving  difficulty:  Besides  its effects  on cow and calf mortality  calving  
difficulty  also decreases  rebreeding  performance.  As the severity  of calving  
difficulty  increases  conception  rate decreases.  This  reduction  in conception  rate 
is due to abnormalities  arising  from  calving  difficulty,  including  delayed  uterine  
involution  and increased  infection,  damage  to the tract and the development  of 
uterine  and ovarian  adhesions.  Therefore,  calving  difficulty  should  be mini ­
mised.  Two factors  that greatly  affect  the incidence  of calving  difficulty  are 
cow's  age and calf sire. The incidence  of calving  difficulty  is 4-8 times  higher  
in first calvers  than in mature  cows and about  twice  as high in second  calvers  
than in mature  cows. Breed  of sire and indeed  sire within  a breed should  be 
carefully  selected  for use on heifers  and young  cows. Cows with a uterine  
infection  should  be treated  at an early stage.
Minerals:  Mineral  deficiencies  and imbalances  are frequently  implicated  as 
a likely  cause  of low conception  rate. However,  scientific  data to substantiate  
this claim  is lacking.  Because  of the low cost of mineral  supplements  it is best 
to supplement  cows during  the dry period  by feeding  a pre-calving  mineral  
supplement  and after calving  a post-calving  mineral  supplement.  Any further  
supplementation  should  be based  on blood,  herbage/feed  and soil analysis.
Season:  A drop of conception  is frequently  seen in dairy herds and in a 
proportion  of suckler  herds following  turn-out  in spring.  This may be related  
to excessive  intakes  of rumen-degradable  protein,  the level of which  is high in 
spring  grass. On-going  Teagasc  experiments  at Belclare  suggest  that the feeding  
of 0.75 kg of fishmeal,  to cows on spring  pasture,  improves  conception  rate.
CoH ’ age: While  heifers  acquire  the ability  to reproduce  once they reach  
puberty,  calving  rate is as low as 20-30%  following  breeding  at the first  or second  
heats  and only reaches  a normal  level (60%)  at the third and subsequent  heats. 
Replacement  heifers  should  be well grown  and regularly  cyclic  before  the start 
of the breeding  season.  Between  5 and 15% of heifers  may have genetic  or 
anatomical  abnormalities  which  prevent  conception.
When heifers  calve as 2-year  olds their post-calving  conception  rates are 
lower  compared  with mature  cows.  This is a reflection  of the increased  demands  
on the young  cow at this time to support  maintenance,  lactation,  growth  and 
reproduction;  hence  the need to have replacements  well grown  at the time of
62
first calving.  Similarly,  old cows nearing  the end of their productive  life tend 
to have a lower  level of fertility.
A.I. vs natural service:  If heat is accurate  and A.I. timed  and carried  out 
correctly,  conception  rate is similar  following  A.I. or natural  service.
Bull  fertility:  Natural  service  bulls can have a major  impact  on pregnancy  
rate and calving  spread.  Unfortunately,  a bull’s infertility  is not usually  discov ­
ered  until  at least  one repeat  interval  has elapsed  since  joining  the herd.  In Ireland  
there is no documented  information  on the fertility  of bulls in natural  service  
but U.K and American  data indicate  that 3-5%  of bulls  are completely  infertile  
and a further  30% are “unsatisfactory ” in terms of semen  quality,  abnormalities  
of the penis and libido.
A veterinary  examination  combined  with a semen  evaluation  one month  
before  the start of the breeding  season  identifies  the majority  of infertile  bulls  
though  not sub-fertile  bulls.  A bull may not remain  fertile  throughout  all of his 
working  life or indeed  throughout  a single  breeding  season.
During  the breeding  season  the farmer  should  check  cows regularly  for 
repeats  and also to check  bulls periodically  for serving  ability.  Where  a bull 
is expected  to serve  a large herd of cows (>50)  it is important  that the bull is 
active  and has a  high  libido.  Because  bulls  vary in libido,  semen  production  and 
mating  ability,  it is difficult  to be precise  about  cow to bull ratio. However,  a 
mature  bull will  generally  cover  up to 40 cows  and a yearling  bull up to 25 cows.
Herd replacements
To avoid  delayed  resumption  of cycles  after  first their  first  calving,  replace ­
ments  should  be 350-t- kg at mating  and 550 kg at calving.  Heifers  should  be 
bred to an easy calving  sire, and should  be bred to calve early in the season.  
Late calving  heifers  will on average  be late calving  cows.

Relative  Tissue Growth  Patterns  and 
Carcass  Composition  in Beef Cattle
M. G. KEANE
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
The main  objective  of the beef  breed  evaluation  programme  which  has been  
carried  out at Grange  Research  Centre  over the past number  of years  has been  
to evaluate  all the common  breed  types  under  Irish condition.  The programme  
was designed  primarily  to provide  information  on the productive  characteristics  
of the different  beef  crosses  out of Friesian  cows  but in the course  of the work  
much  additional  information  was also acquired  on growth  patterns  of body  parts  
and tissues  and how they determine  body composition.
Cattle  can be categorised  into 3 main breed  types:  (1) early maturing  types  
such as the Angus  and Hereford  and their crosses,  (2) dairy types such as the 
Friesian,  Holstein  and Meuse-Rhine  Issel (MRI),  and (3) late maturing  or 
continental  breed  types  such as Limousin,  Blonde  D’Aquitaine,  Charolais  and 
their crosses.  Throughout  this paper the results  from an experiment  which  
compared  Friesians  (dairy  type),  Hereford  x Friesians  (early maturing  type)  and 
Charolais  x Friesians  (late maturing  type)  will be used to indicate  or represent  
the differences  between  these three categories.  The subject  matter  will be 
discussed  under  the following  headings:  (1) non-carcass  parts and kill-out,  (2) 
carcass  physical  composition,  (3) muscle  chemical  composition,  (4) sex type 
and dairy breed  type in relation  to carcass  composition  and classification,  and 
(5) carcass  classification  as an indicator  of carcass  composition. ,
Non-carcass  parts  and kill-out
The non-carcass  parts of beef cattle  are sources  of food and industrial  raw 
materials  in their own right, but the main interest  in them by beef producers  
is in how they influence  killing  out proportion  since this determines  carcass  
weight  on which  payment  is based.  The mean weights  and proportions  of the 
non-carcass  parts for Friesian,  Hereford  x Friesian  and Charolais  x Friesian  
steers  are shown  in Table 1. Taken  together,  transport  weight  loss and weight  
of rumen  contents  ranged  from 99 g/kg for the Charolais  crosses  to 110 g/kg 
for the Friesians.  The higher  value  for the Friesians  over the beef  crosses  was 
due to their  greater  feed intake  and consequently  their  greater  weight  of rumen  
and intestinal  contents.  Thus,  as aproportion  of full liveweight,  empty  liveweight  
ranged  from 890 g/kg for the Friesians  to 901 g/kg for the Charolais  crosses.  
Gastro  intestinal  tract (rumen,  reticulum  and abomasum  empty  plus omasum  
and intestines  with  contents)  as a proportion  of empty  bodyweight  ranged  from  
99 g/kg for the Hereford  crosses  to 110 g/kg for the Friesians,  the higher  value 
for Friesians  being  again  a function  of their  higher  intake  capacity.  Hide,  head  
and feet combined,  ranged  from 124 g/kg for Friesians  to 139 g/kg  for Hereford  
crosses,  the higher  value  for Herefords  being  due  to their  greater  hide  proportion.  
Red offal (lungs,  heart,  liver,  kidneys,  blood,  trim and miscellaneous)  amounted

to 99 g/kg for Friesians,  94 g/kg for Hereford  crosses  and 95 g/kg for Charolais  
crosses.  The higher  value for the Friesians  reflects  the potential  of this dairy  
breed  for higher  metabolic  turnover.  Trimmed  fats (kidney,  channel,  caul, cod 
and topside)  amounted  to 68 g/kg for Friesians,  62 g/kg for Hereford  crosses  
and 55 g/kg for Charolais  crosses.  The higher  value for the Friesians  is in 
agreement  with the known  greater  deposition  of internal  fats in dairy than in 
beef  breeds  and the higher  value  for Hereford  than Charolais  crosses  is in line 
with the generally  greater  fatness  of the Hereford  than the Charolais  breed.
As proportions  of empty  bodyweight,  all the non-carcass  parts (plus chill 
weight  loss) amounted  to 412 g/kg for Friesians,  406 g/kg  for Hereford  crosses  
and 398 g/kg for Charolais  crosses.  This left carcass  weight  (cold)  at 588, 594 
and 602 g/kg for the three  breed  types,  respectively.  Based  on slaughter  weight,  
the conventional  kill-out  proportions  were 533, 543 and 553 g/kg for the 
Friesians;  Hereford  and Charolais  crosses,  respectively.  Thus, at  approximately  
the same liveweight  (570 kg), the cold carcass  weights  for Friesian,  Hereford  
and Charolais  crosses  would  be 304, 310 and 315 kg, respectively.

The data in Table  1 were  used for the detailed  comparison  of the three  breed  
types  because  slaughter  weights  were  similar.  In practice,  however,  these  breed  
types  would  be slaughtered  at different  weights  and slaughter  weight  affects  the 
proportions  of non-carcass  parts and consequently  kill-out  proportion.  Thus,  
carcass  weights  and kill-out  proportions  were calculated  for three different  
slaughter  weights  for each  of the breed  types  (Table  2). The  thre^  weights  chosen  
were 500, 600 and 700 kg, empty  bodyweight.  These  gave slaughter  weights  
which  were similar  for the Hereford  and Charolais  crosses,  but which  were  
somewhat  higher  for Friesians  because  of their greater  gastro-intestinal  tract 
contents.  Over  the range  500 to 700 kg empty  bodyweight,  kill-out  proportion  
increased  by about  20 g/kg for all three breed  types.  At a slaughter  weight  of 
about 670 kg, carcass  weights  were 359, 368 and 373 kg for the Friesians,  
Hereford  and Charolais  crosses,  respectively.  Corresponding  carcass  weights  
at slaughter  weights  of about  770 kg were  420, 430 and 435 kg, respectively.  
In brief, the kill-out  proportion  of Hereford  crosses  was about 10 g/kg higher  
than that of Friesians  and the kill-out  proportion  of Charolais  crosses  was about  
10 g/kg higher  than that of Hereford  crosses.  Kill-out  increased  by about 10 
g/kg  for each 100 kg increase  in slaughter  weight  and this was reasonably  similar  
for the different  breed  types.
Carcass  composition
Carcass  composition  is defined  as the proportions  of fat, muscle,  bone and 
other tissue in the carcass.  Other tissue includes  tendons,  ligaments,  fascia,  
glands  and large blood vessels  and is generally  included  with bone in the 
presentation  of compositional  data. Fat is generally  partitioned  into the subcu ­
taneous  and intermuscular  depots.  Subcutaneous  fat is that which  is visible  and 
overlies  the muscle  on the surface  of the carcass.  Intermuscular  fat comprises  
the seams  of separable  fat lying  beneath  and between  the muscles.  It should  not 
be confused  with intramuscular  fat or marbling  fat which  is the fat between  the 
muscle  fibres within the muscle.  This can only be quantified  by chemical  
analysis  and is then defined  as lipid.
Carcass  composition  changes  continuously  with increasing  weight.  Conse ­
quently  a single  point  estimate  of composition  at a particular  carcass  weight  is
66
of little value  because  it gives no information  on what composition  would  be 
at a different  carcass  weight.  Therefore,  what  is required  is measurement  of the 
growth  rates  of the different  tissues.  This  then permits  estimation  of the weights  
(and hence  the proportions)  of the different  tissues  at any carcass  weight.  Based  
on such tissue growth  measurements,  the proportions  of subcutaneous  fat, 
intermuscular  fat, bone (including  “other tissue ”) and muscle  were estimated  
for all the common  breed  types  at 280,340  and  400 kg carcass  weight.  The  results  
are shown  in Table  3. At 280 kg carcass  weight,  Friesians  had about 18% fat, 
20% bone and 62% muscle.  Corresponding  proportions  were 20%, 19% and 
61% for Hereford  crosses,  15%, 19% and 66% for Limousin  crosses,  14%, 19% 
and 67%  for Charolais  crosses  and 13%, 19% and 68%  for Belgian  Blue  crosses.  
Thus, at the same carcass  weight,  muscle  proportion  ranged  from 61% for 
Herefords  to 68% for Belgian  Blue crosses.  As carcass  weight  increased,  
proportions  of fat increased  and proportions  of muscle  and bone decreased.  
Compared  with at 280 kg, at 400 kg carcass  weight,  fat had increased  by 9% 
and bone and muscle  had decreased  by 3% and 6%, respectively  in Friesians.  
Corresponding  changes  were 11%, 3% and 8% for Hereford  crosses,  7%, 3% 
and 4% for Charolais  crosses  and 7%, 4% and 3% for Belgian  Blue crosses.
The  changes  in fat and muscle  proportions  per 10 kg change  in carcass  weight  
are shown  in Table  4. Rates  of fat change  varied  from 8.2 g per 10 kg carcass  
weight  for Hereford  crosses  to 5.5 g per 10 kg carcass  weight  for Belgian  Blue  
crosses.  Rates  of muscle  change  were lower  and varied  from  -6.3 for Hereford  
crosses  to -2.4 for Belgian  Blue  crosses.  Weights  at similar  total carcass  fatness  
(210  g/kg)  ranged  from 286 kg for Hereford  crosses  to 427  kg for Belgian  Blue  
crosses.  Compared  with Friesians,  Hereford  crosses  were about  30 kg carcass  
lighter  and MRI, Limousin,  Simmental,  Charolais,  Blonde  d’Aquitaine  and 
Belgian  Blue crosses  were about 10, 40, 60, 90, 100 and 110 kg heavier,  
respectively  at the same  carcass  fat proportion.  Muscle  proportion  at constant  
fatness was similar for Friesians,  Hereford  and MRI crosses,  and was

approximately  20, 30, 30, 40 and 50 g/kg higher  for Simmental,  Limousin,  
Blonde  d’Aquitaine,  Charolais  and Belgian  Blue crosses,  respectively.  Thus,  
even at constant  carcass  fatness  the continental  crosses  had a higher  proportion  
of muscle.
As well as differing  in the proportions  of tissues  in the carcass,  breeds  also 
differ in the distribution  of tissues  across  the carcass,  and this distribution  
changes  with  changes  in carcass  weight.  The distribution  of muscle  in the main  
carcass  joints for the three contrasting  breed types (Friesians,  Hereford  x 
Friesians  and Charolais  x Friesians)  at three  muscle  weights  is shown  in Table  
5. The carcass  weights  at which  these  muscle  weights occurred  are also shown. 
At any muscle  weight,  Hereford  crosses  had a lower  proportion  of muscle  in 
the hind limb and higher  proportions  in the flank and ribs than Friesians.  
Charolais  crosses  had a higher  proportion  of muscle  in the hind  limb  and thorax  
and lower  proportions  in the flank  and fore  limb  than  both  Friesians  and Hereford  
crosses.  Overall,  the breeds  did not differ  greatly  in the proportions  of muscle  
in the fore- and hindquarters.  There  were some differences  in the proportions  
of muscle  in the higher  value  joints with the Charolais  crosses  having  more  
muscle  than  Herefords  which  had “good ” conformation.  Of course  the Charolais  
crosses  which  also had “good ” conformation  did have a higher  proportion  of 
higher  value muscle.  On average  the proportion  of higher  value muscle  de­
creased  by 2.67 g per 10 kg increase  in muscle  weight.  Again,  conformation  
improved  with  increasing  (muscle)  weight,  but as already shown,  the proportion  
of higher  value muscle  declined.  In brief therefore,  there were differences  
between  breeds  in muscle  distribution  although  such differences  were small. 
Continental  type  cattle  had more  high  value  muscle  than Friesians  which  in turn 
had more high value muscle  than early maturing  breed types.  Proportions  of 
muscle  in the higher  value  joints  and in the hindquarter  decreased  with  increasing  
carcass  and muscle  weight.

Chemical  composition  of muscle
The chemical  constituents  of muscle  are moisture,  protein,  lipid (intramus ­
cular fat) and ash. Ash usually  amounts  to only about 10 g/kg and is smaller  
than the error  involved  in determining  the other  constituents.  Consequently,  it 
is generally  not measured  and is assumed  at 10 g/kg. The mean composition  
of muscle  is about  720 g/kg moisture,  220 g/kg protein,  50 g/kg lipid and 10 
g/kg ash. However,  as shown  in Table  6, the chemical  composition  of muscle  
is not constant  but varies  between  joints  across  the carcass.  In general,  protein  
proportion  remains  reasonably  constant  but lipid and moisture  proportions  vary 
inversely  with each other.
As is clear from Table 6, the hind limb and /. dorsi had the lowest  lipid 
concentrations  followed  by the fore limb and loin. The flank and thorax  had 
lipid values  almost  double  those  in the hind limb and /. dorsi and the ribs had 
the highest  lipid concentration.  The latter  high value may reflect  the fact that 
complete  separation  of the muscle  and intermuscular  fat is almost  impossible  
in the ribs. Consequently,  the high lipid value  for the ribs may be due to some  
separable  fat remaining  attached  to the muscle.  In brief, it is clear  that muscle  
lipid concentration  can vary from being very low to being quite high.
As with  physical  composition,  chemical  composition  also varies with  weight  
and breed type. The estimated  mean chemical  composition  of the 1. dorsi at 
three carcass  weights  is shown  in Table 7 for the main breed types. Lipid

concentration  varied  from as low as 16 g/kg for Blonde  d’Aquitaine,  Belgian  
Blue and Charolais  steers at 280 kg carcass  weight  to as high as 77 g/kg for 
Hereford  x Friesian  steers  at 4(X) kg carcass  weight.  Some  continental  crosses  
had similar  lipid concentrations  at 340 kg carcass  weight  to Hereford  crosses  
at 280 kg carcass  weight.  Similarly,  Charolais  and Belgian  Blue (or Blonde)  
crosses  at 400 kg carcass  weight  had similar  lipid concentratio'ns  to Friesians  
and Limousin  crosses,  respectively,  at 340 kg carcass  weight.  When  compared  
with data in Tables  3 and 4, it is clear that the differences  in carcass  weight  
between  breeds  at similar  muscle  lipid concentration  are less than at similar  
carcass  fat proportion.  In brief the Hereford  crosses  had the highest  lipid 
concentration  at any weight  followed  by the MRI  crosses  and then the Friesians.  
The Limousin  crosses  had the highest  lipid concentration  of the continentals  
followed  by the Simmental,  Charolais,  Blonde  d’Aquitaine  and Belgian  Blue  
crosses.

Sex type and dairy  breed  type in relation  to composition  and carcass
classiflcation
Steers  and heifers
Surprisingly,  there  are few reported  comparisons  of carcass  composition  in 
heifers  and steers.  Heifers  are generally  considered  to be inferior  to steers  in 
carcass  composition  and consequently  are often discounted  in price per unit 
carcass  weight.  In Ireland  the reasons  for differences  in price between  heifers  
and steers  has little to do with their respective  real value.  The price of steers  
is determined  by market  supports  such as intervention  and export  refunds  and 
by the prices  prevailing  on export  markets.  There  are no market  supports  for 
heifers  and their price is determined  largely  by conditions  in the domestic  
market.  Therefore,  it cannot  be concluded,  that because  steers  are priced  higher  
than heifers  they are of superior  carcass  composition  and of greater  real value.  
Nevertheless,  heifer  careasses  do grade  poorer  (higher  fat score  and/or  poorer  
conformation  score)  than steer  carcasses  from similar  breed  types  at the same  
age or weight  and because  of this there is the perception  that they are of poor  
quality  and lower  value  overall.
The data in Table  8 are from  a comparison  of Hereford  x Friesian  steers  and 
heifers  which  were  reared  together  from  calfhood  to slaughter.  The heifers  were  
serially  slaughtered  to ensure  that they  covered  the range  of fatness  of the steers.  
Slaughter  groups  of heifers  were  then  picked  which  had approximately  the same  
carcass  composition  as the steers.  The steers  were about  60 kg carcass  weight  
heavier  than the heifers.  The heifers  were  about  one half  class  poorer  in carcass  
conformation  than  the steers  and there  was little difference  in carcass  fat score.  
Overall,  composition  between  the two sexes was very similar  with the heifers  
having  slightly  more  bone and muscle  and less fat than the steers.  The heifers  
also had more high value muscle  than the steers. In brief, therefore,  early  
maturing  type heifers  and steers  have similar  proportions  of carcass  fat when  
the heifers  are about 50 kg carcass  weight  lighter  than the steers (the 59 kg

difference  here was excessive  because  fat proportion  was lower  for the heifers  
(204 g/kg)  than for the steers  (213 g/kg)).  The poorer  carcass  conformation  of 
heifers  was accompanied  by a slightly  higher  muscle  proportion  and a consid ­
erably  higher  proportion  of higher  value muscle.
Dairy  breeds
There has been much criticism  from beef interests  of the move towards  
Holsteins  by dairy farmers.  This is mainly  because  the Holsteins  have inferior  
carcass  grades.  As an alternative  to the Friesian-Holstein,  the MRI has been  
proposed  as a suitable  dual purpose  or dairy  breed  because  it has good  carcass  
conformation.  Both  the Holstein  (Holstein  x (Holstein  x Friesian)  and the MRI  
(MRI  X Friesian)  have been evaluated  at Grange  (Table  9). In agreement  with 
much  published  work worldwide,  the Grange  experiments  showed  that even  
though  Holsteins  had considerably  poorer  conformation  than Friesians,  there  
was very little difference  in carcass  composition  between  the two strains.  
However,  the Holsteins  did have a slightly  lower  proportion  of higher  value  
muscle.
In the comparison  between  the Friesians  and MRIs,  the MRIs had much  
superior  carcass  conformation  (0.4 class)  but there were no differences  in the 
proportions  of muscle  or of higher  value muscle.  It is clear  therefore  that in the 
dairy breeds  compared  here there was little relationship  between  carcass  con­
formation  score and the main components  of carcass  composition.

Carcass  classification  and composition
The main purposes  of a carcass  classification  scheme  are (a) to serve as a 
common  language  for the visual  description  of carcasses,  (b) to facilitate  the 
administration  of various  schemes  (i.e. intervention),  and (c) to provide  a basis 
for differential  pricing  of carcasses.  Proponents  and administrators  of carcass  
classification  schemes  do not claim  that such schemes  necessarily  discriminate
72
between  carcasses  of different  muscle  proportions  and muscle  distribution.  The 
classification  schemes  are provided  to describe  traits which  those  involved  in 
trading  and marketing  of beef  carcasses  believe  need  to be described.  However,  
many producers  and many of those involved  in the provision  of technical  
information and  services  to the cattle  and beef  industry believe  that beef  carcass  
classification  does discriminate  between  carcasses  on the basis  of real quality  
and value.
When  the original  Irish  carcass  classification  was established  a large  number  
of carcasses  were boned  out and fat trimmed  to determine  the meat  yields  for 
each  cell of the classification  grid.  Later  when  the common  EC scheme  (EUROP)  
was adopted,  the data  for the Irish  scheme  were  converted  to the EC scale.  These  
are shown  in Table 10. Very few carcasses  occurred  in conformation  class E 
or in fat class 1, so these  classes  have been omitted.  Averaged  across  the four 
fat classes  (2 to 5), mean  meat proportion  declined  from 712 to 662 g/kg or a 
mean decrease  of 16.7 g/kg per class increase  in fatness.  There  was a •trend  
towards  a greater  difference  in meat  proportion  between  fat class  as conforma ­
tion improved.  Averaged  across  the four conformation  classes  (U to P) meat  
yield declined  from 698 to 681 g/kg or a mean decrease  of 5.7 g/kg per 
conformation  class. When  examined  more closely  it is clear that there was 
virtually  no difference  in meat  yield between  conformation  class  “R” and “O” 
and over  75%  of all Irish  steer  carcasses  fall into these  two conformation  classes.  
In brief,  therefore,  the Irish data relating  carcass  classification  to composition  
showed  that fat score was three times as important  as conformation  score in 
determining  the meat  yield  of a carcass  and for the majority  of Irish carcasses  
(conformation  classes  “R” and “O”) conformation  had no significant  influence
on meat yield.  , .
From research  in Great Britain  by the Meat and Livestock  Commission  
(MLC)  and also at Grange  it has become  clear that any relationship  between  
conformation  and composition  depends  on the mix of breed types involved.  
Some  breed  types have both good conformation  and high meat yields  while  
others  have  both poor  conformation  and low meat  yields.  In cattle  populations  
where  only these two distinct  types occur,  then conformation  is closely  asso-

ciated  with meat yield.  In practice  however,  cattle  populations  are comprised  
of a wide  range  of breed  types.  In addition  to the two distinct  types  mentioned  
above  there  are also breed  types  which  have  reasonably  good  conformation  but 
have  rather  low meat  yields  and there  are breed  types  which  have  relatively  poor  
conformation  but have  fairly  high meat  yields.  Thus,  any relationship  between  
conformation  and meat yield depends  on the relative  proportions  of these  
different  breed  types  in the population.  This is evident  from some  recent  results  
from a Grange  experiment  which  compared  Friesians  with Belgian  Blue x 
Friesians  and MRI x Friesians.
The data in Table  11 show  the comparison  by conformation  class  and breed  
type. Belgian  Blue crosses  were predominantly  “R” while Friesians  were  
predominantly  “O”. Muscle  proportions  for the two breed  types/conformation  
classes  were  648 and 593 g/kg,  respectively  while  high  value  muscle  proportions  
were 404 and 394 g/kg, respectively.  Thus, on the basis of this comparison  
between  the Belgian  Blue crosses  (“R”) and the Friesians  (“O”) it would  be 
concluded  that there  was  a big difference  between  the two conformation  classes  
(“R” and “O”) in muscle  proportion  and in high value muscle.
Unlike  the Belgian  Blue crosses  and Friesians  where  each breed type fell 
into a different  conformation  class,  the MRI crosses  fell almost  half and half 
into the same  two classes.  Including  the MRI  crosses  helps  to establish  whether  
the differences  in composition  between  the Belgian  Blue crosses  and the 
Friesians  was due to breed  type or to conformation  class.  There  was essentially  
no difference  between  the “R” and “O” MRIs  in muscle  proportion  and while  
there  was some  difference  in high  value  muscle  proportion  it seems  to have  been  
largely  due to chance  because  the value for the Friesians  was midway  between  
tbe two MRI values.  In brief, if there  had only been Belgian  Blue crosses  and 
Friesians  then there would  have been big differences  in composition  between  
the “R” and “O” conformation  classes,  whereas  if there had only been MRIs,  
there would  have been little or no difference.  Thus,  the differences  in carcass  
composition  between  the conformation  classes  was a function  of the mix of breed  
types involved  and independent  of breed type, conformation  is a poor if not 
worthless  indicator  of carcass  composition,  muscle  distribution  or real carcass  
value.

The proportions  of muscle  and higher  value  muscle  as affected  by fat class  
(for  fat classes  3 and 4) are shown  in Table  12. On average  the difference  between  
the two fat classes  were 25 g/kg muscle  and 2 g/kg higher  value  muscle.  The 
proportion  of higher  value  muscle  would  not be expected  to be influenced  by 
fat class. As with conformation,  there was a breed effect. There was little  
difference  in composition  between  the MRI crosses  and the Friesians  in either  
fat class,  but the Belgian  Blue crosses  had 46 g/kg more muscle  and 10 g/kg 
more high value muscle  in fat class 3 than the mean of the MRI crosses  and 
Friesians.  The corresponding  values  for fat class  4L were 45 g/kg more  muscle  
and 6 g/kg more high value muscle.  In brief, there was an effect  of fat class  
on muscle  proportion  but the difference  between  breeds  within  a fat class was 
greater  than the difference  between  fat classes.
The mean  proportions  of muscle  and higher  value  muscle  together  with the 
ranges  around  these  means  for the four most  important  classification  cells (03, 
04L,  R3, R4L)  are shown  in Table  13. As would  be expected  from  the foregoing  
discussion,  the differences  between  the means  were  not very  large  but the ranges  
around  the means  were very large and overlapped  considerably.  For example,  
the muscle  proportion  in R4L ranged  from 525 to 656 g/kg. This covered  the 
entire  range  found  in 03 (555-621),  practically  the entire  range  found  in 04L 
(521-632)  and most  of the range  in R3 (596-682).  Therefore,  classification  did 
not really  discriminate  between  carcasses  on the basis of muscle  proportion.  
There  was also a very large  range  in proportion  of higher  value  muscle.  Again  
the range  found  in class R4L (371-428)  covered  the entire  ranges  found  in R3 
(378-420)  and 04L (373-421)  and most  of the range  found  in 03 (359-424).  In 
brief,  it is concluded  that carcass  classification  is a very  poor  indicator  of muscle  
proportion  and higher  value muscle  proportion.
While  the foregoing  tables  and discussion  clearly  show that carcass  classi ­
fication  is an unreliable  indicator  of carcass  composition,  it is nevertheless  
necessary  to give statistical  expression  to this. Consequently,  the relevant  
elements  of composition  were  regressed  on fat score  and on conformation  score  
separately  (Table  14). Both  fat proportion  and muscle  proportion  were signifi ­
cantly  related  to fat score.  On average  fat proportion  increased  by 31 g/kg and 
muscle  proportion  decreased  by 25 g/kg per unit increase  in fat class.
However,  while  these relationships  were statistically  significant,  fat score

explained  only one-third  of the variance  in fat proportion  and only one-half  in

Conformation  score was not significantly  related  to fat proportion,  muscle  
proportion,  high value  muscle  proportion  or muscle  size (/. dorsi  area).  The only 
element  of composition  significantly  related  to conformation  score was bone  
proportion  which  decreased  by 10 g/kg  per unit improvement  in conformation.  
In brief,  it is concluded  that fat score  was significantly  related  to fat and muscle  
proportions  but accounted  for only one-third  to one-half  of the variance.  
Conformation  score  was not significantly  related  to any carcass  trait  except  bone  
proportion  which  declined  with improving  conformation.
Conclusions
1. Carcass  weight  as a proportion  of empty  bodyweight  was 588, 594 and 
602 g/kg for Friesians,  Hereford  x Friesians  and Charolais  x Friesians,  respec ­
tively.  Corresponding  kill-out  proportions  (cold  carcass  weights  as a proportion  
of unfasted  final farm weight)  were  533, 543 and 553 g/kg.  Kill-out  proportion  
increased  by about 10 g/kg per 100 kg increase  in slaughter  weight.
2. As carcass  weight  increased,  the proportions  of bone  and muscle  decreased  
and the proportion  of fat increased,  but the rates of these changes  differed  
between  breed types.

3. Compared  with  Friesians  at 320 kg carcass  weight,  Hereford  crosses  were  
about  30 kg carcass  weight  lighter  at the same carcass  fat proportion.  Corre ­
sponding  differentials  for MRI, Limousin,  Simmental,  Charolais,  Blonde  
d’Aquitaine  and  Belgian  Blue  crosses  were 10,40,60,90,100  and 110 kg carcass  
weight  heavier.
4. Breed  types  differed  in muscle  distribution  across  the carcass.  Continental  
type cattle  had a higher  proportion  of higher  value muscle  than Friesians  and 
early maturing  breed types,  while  Friesians  had a higher  proportion  than the 
early  maturing  types  notwithstanding  the fact  that the latter  had better  conforma ­
tion.
5. Mean  muscle  chemical  composition  was about  720 g/kg moisture,  220 
g/kg protein,  50 g/kg lipid and 10 g/kg ash. Chemical  composition  varied  
between  joints  of the carcass,  lipid concentration  was lowest  for the /. dorsi,  
hind limb and fore limb and was highest  for the flank,  thorax  and ribs.
6. At any carcass  weight,  Hereford  crosses  had the highest  muscle  lipid 
concentration  followed  by MRI crosses,  Friesians,  Limousin,  Simmental,  
Charolais,  Blonde  d’Aquitaine  and Belgian  Blue crosses.  The differences  in 
carcass  weight  between  breeds  at similar  muscle  lipid concentration  were less 
than at similar  carcass  fat proportion.
7. Early maturing  breed  type steers  and heifers  had similar  proportions  of 
carcass  fat when the heifers  were about  50 kg carcass  weight  lighter  than the 
steers.  Despite  being  about  one half class poorer  in conformation,  heifers  had 
a slightly  higher  muscle  proportion  and a considerably  higher  proportion  of 
higher  value  muscle  than  steers.  Despite  big differences  in carcass  conformation  
there  was little difference  in carcass  composition  between  Friesians,  Holsteins  
and MRI crosses.
8. In the Irish cattle population,  fat score is three times as important  as 
conformation  in indicating  muscle  proportion  but both are poor indicators  of 
same.  Any relationship  between  conformation  and muscle  proportion  depends  
on the breed mix involved  but generally  there is no such relationship.
9. The range  in muscle  proportion  for classes  03, 04L, R3 and R4L was 
555 to 621, 521 to 632, 596 to 682 and 525 to 656 g/kg, respectively.  Clearly  
classification  grade  is a poor indicator  of muscle  proportion.
10. Fat score was significantly  related  to both fat proportion  and muscle  
proportion  but accounted  for only one third to one half  of the variance  in these.
Conformation  score was not significantly  related  to muscle  proportion,  fat 
proportion,  high value muscle  proportion  or muscle  size. Its only statistical  
relationship  was with bone proportion.

Exploitation  of Beef Breed  Differences
M. G. KEANE
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
The  reformed  Common  Agricultural  Policy  has introduced  a quota  on suckler  
cow and male cattle numbers  for premia  payments  and has set maximum  
stocking  densities  for premia  eligible  animals.  Therefore,  the best opportunity  
for further  increases  in productivity  and efficiency  in beef production  lies in 
the full exploitation  of the range  of beef  breeds  available.  The main  productivity  
differences  between  the various  beef breeds  have been described  previously  
(Keane,  1990).  The purpose  of this paper  is to quantify  these differences  in 
greater  detail,  and  to include  additional  information  on carcass  composition  and 
quality  differences.  The topics  discussed  here  are (1) trends  in sire breed  usage,  
(2) calving  traits  by sire  breed,  (3) relative  productivity  of progeny  from  different  
sire breeds,  (4) ranking  of approved  bulls  across  breeds,  (5) carcass  composition  
and quality,  and (6) carcass  classification.
Trends  in sire breed  usage
The distribution  of inseminations  by sire breed  since 1985 is shown in  Table  
1. With the exceptions  of 1987 and 1991, when they fell to 32%, Friesian  
inseminations  have remained  constant  at 37% to 39%. Aberdeen  Angus  
inseminations  have also remained  constant  at 9% to 10%.  The consistent  trend  
has been the substitution  of the continental  breeds  for the Hereford.  Hereford  
inseminations  declined  from  32%  in 1985  to 8% in 1992  while  in the same  period  
continental  inseminations  increased  from 19% to 42%.  Within  the continentals  
there have also been changes.  In the mid 1980s,  the proportions  of Charolais,  
Simmental  and Limousin  inseminations  were similar.  Since  then, Simmental  
inseminations  have remained  constant  at about 10%, Limousin  inseminations  
have  increased  slightly  to about  12% while  Charolais  inseminations  have  more

than doubled  to 17%.  Belgian  Blue  inseminations  have  increased  from 0 to 4%. 
Friesian  inseminations  are determined  by the need to provide  replacement  
heifers  for the dairy herd, and Angus  inseminations  appear  to be determined  
by the suitability  of the breed  for use on heifers.  Thus,  the only  real opportunity  
for change  is substitution  amongst  the beef  breeds,  and there  has been  large  scale  
substitution  of continentals  for Hereford  in recent  years.
In addition  to the national  trend it is also of interest  to examine  the trends  
for neighbouring  regions  and countries  (Table  2). Both  England  plus  Wales  and 
Scotland  have a higher proportion  of Friesian  inseminations  than Ireland  
(Republic  and North).  Despite  the decline  mentioned  above,  the Hereford  is still 
more  widely  used here (8%) than in England  plus Wales  (3%),  Scotland  (1%)  
and Northern  Ireland  (2%).  The Angus  is still more  widely  used here  also (9%)  
than in Northern  Ireland  or Britain  (3%-5%).  Thus, early maturing  breed  
inseminations  have  fallen  to 7% in Northern  Ireland,  6% in England  plus Wales  
and to 4% in Scotland  compared  with 17% here. Amongst  the continentals,  
Limousin  inseminations  are fairly  consistent  between  regions  but there  are big 
differences  in Simmental  usage  which  ranges  from 5% in England  plus Wales  
to 20%  inNorthem  Ireland.  Northern  Ireland  has 15%  of  Charolais  inseminations  
compared  with  9% in England  plus  Wales  and 11% in Scotland.  Northern  Ireland  
is also the only  region  where  the Blonde  d’Aquitaine  is fairly  widely  used (9%). 
To date all regions  have similar  usage  of Belgian  Blue (4%-7%).
Since  inseminations  account  for only 50%-60%  of total matings  and since  
more  dairy  cows  are bred by artificial  insemination  (AI) than suckler  cows,  the 
distribution  of inseminations  does  not necessarily  reflect  the distribution  of total 
matings.  Unlike  AI, there  is no national  record  of natural  matings  and the only 
way an estimate  of natural  matings  can be obtained  is by survey.  Such  a survey  
was undertaken  recently  (Drennan  and Power,  1992)  and the distribution  of AI

and total matings  is shown  in Table  3. Friesian  and Angus  constitute  smaller  
proportions  of total matings  than of total inseminations,  and the remaining  
breeds  constitute  proportionately  more. Amongst  the latter,  the Hereford shows  
the greatest  difference  between  AI (8%)  and total  matings  (15%).  The  three  main  
continental  breeds  follow  the same trend  in AI and total  matings  (17%, 9% and 
12%,  and 20%, 11% and 13% for Charolais,  Simmental  and Limousin,  respec ­
tively).  Practically  all Belgian  Blue matings  appear  to have been by AI.
From the breed  distribution  of total matings,  the breed  composition  of the 
national  calf crop for 1993 was predicted  and compared  with previous  years  
(Table  4). Prior  to 1985 Friesians  and Herefords  tended  to substitute  for each 
other  (i.e. when Friesians  decreased  Herefords  increased  and vice versa).  Since  
then however,  continentals  have substituted  for both Friesians  and Herefords.  
From  1985  to 1993  Friesian,  Angus  and Hereford  combined  decreased  from  82% 
to 49%, while continentals  (including  “other ”) increased  from 18% to 51%.  
Thus,  the national  calf crop for 1993 consists  approximately  of 30% Friesians,  
20% early maturing  breed types and 50% continental  breed types with the 
Charolais  constituting  20% of the latter.

Calving  traits by sire breed
Factors  which  have a major  influence  on the breed  of bull used particularly  
in dairy  herds  are the incidence  of calving  difficulty,  calf  mortality  and gestation  
length.  These  are shown  in Table  5 for the different  sire breeds.  In brief,  there  
is little difference  in these traits between  the Friesian,  Angus  and Hereford  
breeds.  For these  the mean  serious  calving  difficulty  percentage  is 2.1, the mean  
calf mortality  percentage  is 1.6 and the mean gestation  length  is 281 days. In 
contrast,  the continentals  have mean calving  difficulty,  calf mortality  and 
gestation  length  values  of 4.9%,  2.3%  and 285 days,  respectively.  There  are some  
differences  in these  traits  amongst  the continental  breeds  but they are not very 
large-Charolais  has the highest  (5.6%)  and Limousin  has the lowest  (4.4%)  
calving  difficulty  incidence,  Belgian  Blue has the highest  (3.0%)  and Blonde  
d’Aquitaine  has the lowest  (1.2%)  calf mortality  and Belgian  Blue has the 
shortest  (283  days)  and Blonde  d’Aquitaine  has the longest  (287  days)  gestation  
length.

Relative  productivity  of progeny  from different  sire breeds
In Ireland,  data on the productivity  of the different  breed  crosses  for beef 
production  are available  from  two sources  - the Breed  Characterisation  Research  
Programme  at Grange  Research  Centre  and the Beef  Progeny  Test Programme  
at the Department  of Agriculture  and Food. The Breed  Characterisation  Re­
search  Programme  provides  data  on a range  of traits  from  feed intake  to muscle  
chemical  composition,  whereas  the Performance  Test data are confined  to 
carcass  gain and carcass  grades.  Where  both programmes  generate  data on the 
same traits these data should  be similar  and the combined  results  from both 
programmes  should  be more  accurate  for these  traits  than the individual  results.  
The data from  the two programmes  for carcass  gain,  carcass  conformation  and 
carcass  fat score are shown  in Table  6. Because  the Breed  Characterisation  
Programme  has not included  the Angus  and the Progeny  Test Programme  has 
no data  yet on the MRI  and  Belgian  Blue,  there  is no comparison  for these  breeds.

Otherwise,  all comparisons  for carcass  gain show  remarkably  good agreement  
and are within  two percentage  points.  The only difference  of any consequence  
is the change  in ranking  of the Simmental  and Blonde  d’Aquitaine  between  the 
two programmes.  There is also very good agreement  between  the two pro­
grammes  in the ranking  for carcass  conformation  and fat score.

and the Progeny  Test  Programme  but all other  trait rankings  are from  the Breed  
Characterisation  Programme  only,  as these  traits  are not reported  for the Progeny  
Test  Programme.  Other  than the Angus  progeny  which  had a lower  value,  there  
was little  difference  in slaughter  weight  for age between  the Friesian,  Hereford,  
MRI,  Limousin  and Blonde  d’Aquitaine  progeny  while  the Simmental,  Belgian  
Blue and Charolais  progeny  were  4% to 7% superior  to these.  All beef  crosses  
had higher  kill-out  values  than Friesians  with the continentals  having  higher  
values  than the traditional  beef breeds.  Carcass  weight  for age differed  little  
between  the Friesian  and Angus  progeny. Hereford,  MRI  and Limousin  progeny  
were  4%-5%  superior  while  the Blonde  d’Aquitaine,  Simmental,  Belgian  Blue  
and Charolais  progeny  were 8%-ll%  superior.
Some  carcass  quality  traits  are also shown  in Table  7. At the same  age, Angus  
progeny  produced  6% less muscle  than  Friesian  and Hereford  progeny  produced  
only the same quantity  of muscle  even though  they had 4% greater  carcass  
weight.  MRI  progeny  produced  6% more  muscle  in line with their  5% superior  
carcass  weight,  indicating  essentially  no difference  in carcass  composition  
between  the Friesians  and MRI crosses.  All continentals  produced  11%-19% 
more  muscle  than Friesian  and Hereford  progeny,  with the Limousin  progeny  
at the lower  end of this range  and the Belgian  Blue and Charolais  progeny  at 
the upper  end. Muscle  size paralleled  muscle  weight  for age. There  was no 
difference  between  the Friesian,  Angus,  Hereford  and MRI progeny  in the 
proportion  of higher  value  muscle.  The continentals  had 2%-3%  more  of their  
muscle  as higher  value muscle.

Ranking  of approved  bulls across  breeds
The Approved  A.I. Beef  Bull List (1993)  compiled  by the Department  of 
Agriculture  and Food shows  the breeding  value  of bulls relative  to the mean  
of their  own breed  (RBV).  In addition,  breed  means  from  the Beef  Progeny  Test 
Programme  are also published.  From these two sources  a ranking  of all the 
approved  bulls  can be compiled  across  breeds.  This is shown for selected  bulls  
(generally  the best and poorest  for growth  rate within  a breed)  in Table  8. To 
generate  such a ranking  some  base must  be assumed.  For the present  purposes  
the base taken  was the mean  of the Angus  breed.  Thus,  the ranking  of the two 
Angus  bulls selected  (COO  and MLI)  did not change.  To calculate  the differ ­
ences  in carcass  weight  between  the progeny  of the various  bulls,  it was also 
assumed  that the progeny  of Friesian  cows  mated  to Angus  bulls of the breed  
mean value for growth  rate, would  have a carcass  weight  of 300 kg when 
slaughtered  at around  two years  of age. The carcass  weights  of the progeny  of 
the other  bulls were calculated  relative  to this. (It should  be kept in mind  that 
only  half  of the difference  in breeding  value  of a bull is passed  on to his progeny).
While  the ranking  of the Angus  bulls did not change  (because  the baseline  
taken was the mean of the Angus  breed),  the breeding  values  of the bulls of 
all the other  breeds  did change  when  expressed  relative  to the mein  of the Angus  
breed.  For example,  Hereford  GSE  which  has an RBV  of 117 relative  to its own 
breed  mean  has an adjusted  breeding  value  (ABV)  of 127 relative  to the mean  
of the Angus  breed.  Similarly,  Limousin  PEB and Charolais  IC27 which  have  
RBVs  of 119 and 115, respectively,  have ABVs  of 131 and 141 relative  to the 
mean of the Angus  breed.  Translated  into differences  in carcass  weight  at a 
constant  age, GSE  is +41 kg, PEB is +47 kg and IC27 is +62 kg. These  values  
indicate  the enormous  potential  in productivity  that exists both between  and 
within  breeds.
Carcass  composition  and quality
In the foregoing  discussion,  it was assumed  that all breed types were  
slaughtered  at a constant  age of about  two years.  This  was  necessary  to emphasise  
the magnitude  of the differences  between  breeds  and between  bulls within  a 
breed.  In practice  however,  animals  of the different  breed  types  are generally  
slaughtered  at different  ages and weights, although,  there  is an acceptable  range  
in composition,  generally  defined  in terms  of fatness,  within  which  carcasses  
must fall. It is widely  believed  that some  breed  types  are leaner  or fatter  than 
others.  This is so only  when  expressed  on an age or weight  constant  basis.  The 
reason  for such age or weight  constant  differences  in composition  is that the 
three  main  carcass  tissues  (muscle,  fat and bone)  have  different  relative  growth  
rates in the different  breed types. Thus, at any constant  end point there are 
differences  in composition,  but if the end point  is allowed  vary with breed  type  
then all breed  types  can have similar  composition  or at least can have similar  
proportions  of carcass  fat. This is illustrated  in Table  9 where  the proportions  
of carcass  fat at 280, 340 and 400 kg carcass  weight  is shown  for the progeny  
of the different  sire breeds  and Friesian  cows. With increasing  weight,  the 
proportion  of fat in the carcass  increased  for all breed  types  but it increased  more
84
rapidly  for some breed types than for others.  For example,  over the carcass  
weight  range  280 to 400 kg the fat concentration  of Hereford  cross carcasses  
increased  by 100 g/kg, compared  with 70 g/kg for Charolais  crosses.  Exami ­
nation  of the data  shows  that Hereford  and Charolais  crosses  had similar  carcass  
fatness  at carcass  weights  of 280 and 400 kg, respectively.  Similarly,  Friesians  
and Simmental  crosses  had similar  carcass  fatness  at carcass  weights  of 340 and 
400 kg, respectively  as did Limousin  and Belgian  Blue crosses.  It can be 
calculated  that Friesians  of 320 kg carcass  weight  had similar  carcass  fatness  
(205 g/kg)  to Hereford  crosses  at 280 kg and Charolais  crosses  at 400  kg. Clearly  
therefore,  all breed  types  can be of similar  fatness  if slaughtered  at the appro ­
priate  carcass  weight.  In the context  of exploiting  the potential  of the different  
breed  types,  substitution  of the Hereford  by the Limousin,  Charolais  and Belgian  
Blue would  permit  increases  in carcass  output  at constant  carcass  fatness  of 
proportionately  0.27,0.43  and 0.50,  respectively.  With  quotas  on cattle  numbers,  
this is a means  through  which  producers  can increase  output  and productivity.
With regard  to the proposed  340 kg carcass  weight  intervention  limit, it is 
worth  noting  that the intermediate  weight  in Table  9 is 340 kg. Where  carcass  
composition  or fatness  is important,  a single  carcass  weight  limit is not appro ­
priate  to a beef industry  which  was a range  of breed  types.  At 340 kg, carcass  
fat proportion  ranged  from 162 g/kg for Belgian  Blue crosses  to 255 g/kg for 
Hereford  crosses.  There  is no suggestion  in the data that any of the breed  types  
had insufficient  fat for general  market  purposes  at 340 kg carcass  weight.
After  the composition  of the carcass,  the next most important  quality  issue  
is the chemical  composition  of the muscle.  The mean  chemical  composition  of 
beef muscle  from the L. dorsi is approximately  720 g/kg moisture,  220 g/kg 
protein,  10 g/kg  ash and  50 g/kg  lipid  (fat).  (The  term  lipid  is used  here  to describe  
the fat which is chemically  extracted  from the muscle  and to differentiate  
between  this chemically  determined  fat and the separable  fat of the carcass).

is shown  for the various  breed  types  in Table  10. As with  separable  fat proportion,  
lipid  proportion  increased  with  increasing  carcass  weight  and  did so more  rapidly  
for some breeds  than for others.  For example,  over the carcass  weight  range  
280 to 400 kg, lipid concentration  increased  by 51 g/kg for Hereford  progeny  
compared  with an increase  of only 21 g/kg for Belgian  Blue progeny.  The 
difference  between  breed types in carcass  weight  at similar  L. dorsi lipid 
concentration  was less than the difference  at similar  carcass  fat proportion.  For 
example,  Hereford  and Charolais  crosses  had similar  muscle  lipid  concentration  
at carcass  weights  of 280 and 340 kg, respectively  compared  with carcass  
weights  of 280 and 400 kg for similar  carcass  fat proportion.  Similarly,  Friesians  
and Charolais  crosses  had similar  muscle  lipid concentrations  at 340 and 400 
kg, respectively  compared  with carcass  weights  of 320 and 400 kg for similar  
carcass  fat proportion.  In the context  of the 340 kg carcass  weight  limit for 
intervention,  it is again  apparent  that there  were  very large  differences  between  
breeds  in muscle  lipid concentration  at this carcass  weight.  For example,  the 
lipid concentration  of Hereford  progeny  muscle  was double  that of Blonde  
d’Aquitaine  and Belgian  Blue progeny  muscle.
Carcass  classification
Carcass  classification  is a widely  discussed  topic  in beef  production,  but there  
is some  confusion  on what  its real purpose  is. The most  commonly  cited  purpose  
is to serve  as a common  language  amongst  the various  sectors  of the beef  industry  
(producers,  processors,  wholesalers,  butchers,  etc.), but what such a common  
language  is supposed  to describe  has not been defined.  There  is a widespread  
belief  that the classification  score indicates  the real quality  and true value of 
a carcass  but this is not necessarily  so. Two  carcasses  with similar  classification  
scores  could  be very  different  in quality  and value  while  two carcasses  of similar  
quality  and value  could  have very different  classification  scores.  Attempts  to
86
evaluate  the usefulness  of classification  are hampered  by the fact  that the grading  
is subjective,  and there are no objectively  measurable  parameters  which  cor­
respond  to the subjective  grades.
Intuitively,  carcass  fat score  would  be considered  a predictor  of the proportion  
of fat in the carcass.  Furthermore,  it would  be expected  that the interval  between  
one class  and the next  would  be the  same for all classes  and thus, that changing  
fat score would  represent  a constant  rate of change  in carcass  fat proportion.  
While  it is generally  believed  that increasing  fat score  does indicate  increasing  
carcass  fatness,  there is nothing  to indicate  what proportion  (or range in 
proportions)  of carcass  fat is indicated  by any particular  fat score or what a 
change  in fat score represents  in terms  of changing  carcass  fat proportion.
The relevance  of conformation  score  is even more  obscure  than that of fat 
score.  One or more  of the following  traits  are generally  believed  to be indicated  
by conformation  - muscle  proportion,  muscle  and fat proportion,  bone  propor ­
tion, muscle/bone  ratio,  muscle  size and muscle  distribution  (e.g. proportion  of 
muscle  in the hind-quarter  or in the higher  value  joints).  Because  cattle are 
generally  slaughtered  within  a fairly  narrow range  of fatness  and conformation,  
it is difficult  to find a data set where  both carcass  classification  and carcass  
compiosition  were measured  over  a usefully  wide  range.  However,  a recent  data 
set from Grange  does have both composition  and classification  measured  on 
96 carcasses  varying  in fatness  and conformation.
The relationships  between  fat class and the proportions  of fat and muscle  
in the carcass are shown in Table 11. Total fat proportion  increased  
by 31 g/kg per unit increase  in fat class.  While  these  changes  were statistically  
significant,  the proportions  of variance  explained  by the regressions  were quite  
low indicating  that while  fat score  was related  to carcass  fat proportion,  it was 
nevertheless  a poor indicator  of carcass  fat proportion.
In contrast  to fat score, which  although  poorly  related,  was nevertheless  
related  to compositional  traits,  conformation  was related  to bone  proportion  only 
and even  then  it explained  only 15% of the variation  in bone  proportion  (Table  
12). Conformation  was not significantly  related  to muscle  proportion,  fat 
proportion,  muscle  size or the proportion  of muscle  in the higher  value  joints.  
For all practical  purposes  therefore,  conformation  had no relationship  with 
actual  carcass  composition  or real carcass  value.

The reason  why classification  score  is a poor indicator  of composition  and 
value is evident  from the data in Table 13 which  shows  the range in fat and 
muscle  proportions  and proportion  of higher  value  muscle  for the classes  04L, 
03, R4L and R3. For R4L, fat proportion  ranged  from 161 to 305 g/kg. This 
range  covered  all of the 03 range  and most  of the R3 and 04L ranges.  For 04L, 
muscle  proportion  ranged  from 521 to 632 g/kg, for 03, it ranged  from 555 to 
621 g/kg, for R4L, it ranged  from 525 to 656 g/kg, and for R3, it ranged  from  
596 to 682 g/kg. Therefore,  except  for the upper  end of the R3 range,  all the 
carcasses  could have fitted within  the R4L muscle  range. Similarly,  for the 
proportion  of higher  value  muscle,  except  for the upper  end of R4L,  all carcasses  
could  have fitted  within  the 03 higher  value  muscle  range.  These  data demon ­
strate  that classification  did not reasonably  differentiate  between  carcasses  on 
the basis of either  fat proportion,  muscle  proportion  or proportion  of muscle  
in the higher  value joints.
As the carcasses  in question  came  from  3 breed  types  - Friesians  (FR),  MRI  
X Friesians  (MR)  and Belgian  Blue  x Friesians  (BB),  it was of interest  to examine  
the relationship  between  fat score  and carcass  fat proportion  within  breed  type

(Table  14). At both  fat classes  3 and 4L, FR had a higher  proportion  of fat than  
MR which  in turn had a higher  proportion  of fat than BB. There  is no obvious  
explanation  why the relationship  between  fat class and carcass  fat proportion  
should  vary with breed  type. Muscle  proportion  varied  also with breed  type at 
constant  fat class,  but the differences  between  FR and MR in muscle  proportion  
and proportion  of higher  value  muscle  were  quite  smalt,  whereas  the differences  
between  these two and BB were quite large at any particular  fat class.
As well as differing  at constant  fat class, breeds  also differed  at constant  
conformation  class  (Table  15). Since  there  were  few  BB animals  in conformation  
class O and few FR animals  in conformation  class R, the comparison  at each  
conformation  class  involves  only  two breed  types.  At conformation  class  O there  
was little  difference  between  FR and MR but at conformation  class  R, BB had 
36 g/kg less fat and 44 g/kg more muscle  than MR. Thus,  there was a much  
greater  difference  between  breeds within a single conformation  class than 
between  the means  for different  conformation  classes.
There  are many  reasons  why  fat class  might  not be a good  predictor  of carcass  
fat proportion  (differences  between  graders,  variations  in grading  with prevail ­
ing levels  of fat and type of cattle,  disturbance  of fat by the operation  of the 
hide puller),  but obvious  reasons  are that less than 50% of the total fat is

type and carcass  weight  is shown  in Table 16. At a carcass  weight  of 280 kg 
subcutaneous  fat as a proportion  of total fat ranged  from  406 g/kg for Charolais

subcutaneous  fat as a proportion  of total carcass  fat increased  until at 400 kg 
carcass  weight  it ranged  from 458 g/kg for Belgian  Blue crosses  to 507 g/kg

breed  types  and heavy  carcasses  appear  fatter  than they actually  are (because  
more  of their  total  fat is visible)  relative  to carcasses  of late maturing  breed  types  
and heavy  carcasses.

Land
Our farm is an all-grass  farm of 86 map acres,  adjusted  to 70 acres and 10 
acres are rented.  Ten acres are fenced  off for deer which  leaves  70 acres for 
sheep.  This land consists  of a wet peaty soil on the flat and heavy  soil on the 
hills. Thirteen  acres were reclaimed  from cut-away  bog which  floods  during  
winter  and in wet summers.  As a result  some constraints  arise: early grass is 
difficult  to produce  on this farm; flock turnout  in spring  is delayed  until late 
March  and all sheep  must be returned  to the sheds before  Christmas.
It is very good land for producing  grass  in dry summers.  Last summer  was 
difficult  due to the wet, cold conditions.
Winter  feeding
Ewes are housed  on straw and meal feeding  commences  8 weeks  prior to 
lambing  with 120 g per head per day increasing  to 700 g for the last 3 weeks  
pre-lambing.  From  lambing  to turnout  nearly  1 kg per ewe per day is fed. The 
ration  consists  of a barley/beet  pulp/soyabean  mix (18%  crude  protein)  and  sheep  
minerals.
Lambing  date
Lambing  is from March  7 to mid-April  during  which there is 24 hour  
supervision.  Fostering  lambs  on the ewes  with  single  lambs  is part  of the system.  
Lambs  are 2 weeks  old when  the flock is moved  to grass.  No meals  are fed at 
grass  post lambing  or during  the summer.  Meals  are introduced  to light lambs  
remaining  in late October  but intakes  are low until mid November.

Our pattern  of lamb  sales  is usually  2 weeks  behind  most  sheep  farmers: This  
is caused  by several  factors.  Firstly,  we have  a coccidiosis  problem.  All our  lambs  
are affected  by it between  4 and 8 weeks  of age. Mortality  is negligible  but growth  
rates are adversely  affected.  Secondly,  we ensure  that all our ewes  are suckling  
2 lambs  if they have two sound  teats. So, we have no ‘single ’ lambs.  Thirdly,  
we have  a high  percentage  of triplets  and quads  which  are slower  to mature  than 
singles  or twins.
Buffer  feed
Owing to our high stocking  rate we are vulnerable  to severe weather  
conditions.  Hence,  we always  keep a full year’s supply  of silage  on reserve  to 
act as a buffer  in these conditions.
Deer
Present  Red Deer stock consists  of 36 hinds, 16 calves  and 1 stag.
Future
We feel that the carcass  quality  of our lambs  is satisfactory.  Last  autumn  we 
introduced  a Suffolk  and a Charollais  ram into the  flock  for breeding  purposes.  
We intend  to continue  improving  the milking  ability  of our ewes.

Systems  of Early  Lamb  Production
S. FLANAGAN
Teagasc,  Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam, Co. Galway.
One  of the principal  difficulties  in managing  a high  output  grass-based  system  
of early lamb production  is the lack of grass growth  during  winter  and early  
spring.  This, in particular,  limits the stock carrying  capacity  of permanent  
pastures.  In the search  for a resolution  of this problem,  two alternative  systems  
have  been  developed  at the Teagasc  Sheep  Farm,  Knockbeg,  Carlow  based  either  
on autumn  sown  Italian  ryegrass  or on fodder  beet grown  as a main  crop. Both  
crops produce  high quality  feed at relatively  low cost.
It will be shown  in this report  that these  crops  have a high feeding  capacity  
for early  lambing  ewes  and  that,  when  properly  supplemented  with  concentrates,  
the resulting  lamb  growth  rates were  sufficiently  high to meet  target  sale dates  
for early marketing.  Both  systems  were  examined  by using  the farmlet  system  
approach.  Inputs  and outputs  were recorded  in order  to provide  guidelines  for 
feed budgeting  and planned  production.  It is considered  that the growing  of I. 
ryegrass  provides  a useful  option  for all-grass  farms which  carry early lamb  
enterprises  and which  require  silage  conservation  for livestock.  Production  of 
fodder  beet  is confined  mainly  to sugar  beet  growing  areas  where  the technology  
for growing,  harvesting  and feeding  the crop mechanically  is well developed.
(1) ALL-GRASS  SYSTEM
The research  at Knockbeg  involved  grazing  by flocks  lambing  in January  
1988 and 1989.  In preparation  for this, Italian  ryegrass  (cv. Lemtal)  was sown 
by direct  reseeding  in August  1987 at the rate of 40 kg per ha. Compound  
fertiliser  (10:10:20)  was applied  at 250 kg per ha at time of sowing.
Ewes were housed  in early December  and fed silage  ad libitum  with con­
centrate  supplements,  commencing  at the rate of 0.25 kg per ewe per day and 
increasing  to 0.70 kg in the final two weeks  before  lambing.  After  lambing  in 
1988  the turnout  of ewes  and lambs  to the I. ryegrass  was delayed  for three  weeks  
due to unfavourable  weather.  During  this  time  the ewes  were  fed silage  ad libitum  
plus 1.6 kg concentrates  per head  per day. Lambs  were  introduced  to creep  feed 
at 1 week old.  The turnout  date was January  14. In 1989  ewes  and lambs  were  
turned  out three weeks  earlier,  i.e. January  24. The number  of lambs  per ewe  
grazing  was 1.33 in 1988 and 1.55 in 1989.
Pasture  management
Ewes and lambs  were turned  out to the I. ryegrass  in early February.  The 
I. ryegrass  was sub-divided  into temporary  paddocks  using portable  electric  
fencing.  The aims  of grazing  management  were to offer  the pasture  for grazing  
on an unrestricted  basis and to optimise  the conditions  for achieving  high lamb  
growth  rates. Hence,  ewes  and lambs  were  moved  to a new paddock  whenever  
supplies  in the paddock  being  grazed  were considered  limiting,  i.e. when the 
sward  height  was grazed  down  to about  4 cm. This meant  in practice  that each
94
paddock  was grazed  for 5-6 days.  Concentrate  supplements  were  trough  fed at 
the rate of 0.5 kg per ewe per day for 5-6 weeks.  Lambs  were creep  fed until 
they reached  slaughter  weight.
In both  years,  the first  grazing  of I. ryegrass  was  completed  after  4 to 5 weeks,  
i.e. early March.  The flock  was then transferred  to permanent  pastures,  mainly  
perennial  ryegrass,  which  had been rested  for the winter  and dressed  with 34 
kg N fertiliser  per ha on about  February  1. The stocking  rate on the permanent  
pasture  in 1988 was high, 24 ewes  per ha. However,  this stocking  rate was not 
supported  solely on the permanent  pasture,  as whenever  the I. ryegrass  had 
recovered  sufficiently,  second  and third  grazings  were  taken.  In order  to provide  
for summer  cuts of silage,  the I. ryegrass  pasture  was closed  in early April.  From  
then until  July,  the flock  was grazed  exclusively  on the permanent  pasture,  with 
the stocking  rate declining  regularly  as lambs  were  drafted  for slaughter  during  
April and May.
Lambs  were weighed  and drafted  at a standard  body finish  as assessed  by 
handling  for light-to-medium  fat cover  on the loin, rump and tail. They were  
weaned  in mid-April  and grazed  selectively  thereafter,  while  the ewes  were  mob 
stocked  at 50 ewes  per ha. Following  silage  cutting  during  summer,  grazing  of 
1. ryegrass  was resumed  in late  July  when  ewes  were  flushed  for a new  production  
cycle.
Two years ’ results
Lamb  performance  and details  of concentrate  inputs  are shown  in Table 1. 
Lamb  growth  rates in early lactation,  315g/day  in 1988 and 300g/day  in 1989,  
met the requirements  of early marketing  as shown by the average  age at 
slaughter,  92 days and 102 days in 1988 and 1989 respectively.
The  amounts  of I. ryegrass  pasture  on offer  for grazing  at turnout,  as estimated  
by clips taken  at ground  level,  were 1200  kg DM per ha in 1988,  and 1600 kg 
in 1989.
Under  the grazing  conditions  described  above, the realised  stocking  rate was 
16.8 ewes  per ha when  averaged  over the two years.  These  results  confirm  the 
advantage  of I. ryegrass  for short-term  grazing  as a means of overcoming  
seasonal  constraints  in the supplies  of permanent  pasture,  as occur in early  
spring.
Lamb  growth  rates from 5 weeks  of age to slaughter  were high, 346g and 
334g/day  in 1988 and 1989 respectively,  and as a result,  finished  liveweights  
for slaughter  were  achieved  at a young  age, viz., 13 weeks  on average  in 1988.  
In 1989 it was decided  to retain  lambs  for extended  grazing  in order  to increase  
carcass  weights.  As a result,  average  carcass  weight  in 1989  was over  2kg heavier  
than in 1988 but the lambs were 10 days older at slaughter.  In relation  to 
maximising  the financial  returns  from  early  lamb  production,  management  must  
strike  a delicate  balance  in this matter  as the trade is characterised  by falling  
prices  following  the initial  peak in April.
Almost  all lambs  reached  finished  liveweights  by June 1, the date around  
which mid-season  supplies  arrive  on the market  and the price  falls by about  20 
per cent.
95
The concentrate  inputs  shown  in Table  1 provide  guidelines  for drawing  up 
feed  budgets  for the production  of early-season  lambs  under  grazing  conditions.  
Concentrate  inputs  for ewes were similar  for both years  but lambs  consumed  
45%  more  creep  in 1989  than  in 1988,  due to being  retained  longer  at grass  before  
drafting.

Conclusion
These  results  were  recorded  at Knockbeg  using  a farmlet  system  approach,  
and they can be interpreted  for planning  early lamb production  on all-grass  
farms.
Autumn  sown  I. ryegrass  provides  strategic  grazing  for  January  lambing  ewes  
at a time of year when permanent  pasture  supplies  are scarce.  For short-term  
grazing,  it can be stocked  at 16 to 17 ewes  per ha when  concentrate  supplements  
are fed as described.
During  the finishing  period  in April  and May permanent  pasture,  which has 
been suitably  managed  during  winter,  can be stocked  at 16 to 24 ewes per ha
96
depending on grazing  date, declining  as lambs  are drafted.  During  the summer  
the dry flock  can be stocked  at 50 ewes  per ha while  the I. ryegrass  is used for 
'2 to 3 cuts of silage.
The period  of flushing,  hormone  treatment  and post-mating  management,  
including  repeat  matings  in October,  extends  from  late July to late November.  
Fertilised  pastures  at Knockbeg  were stocked  at 25 ewes per ha during  this 
period.  In October  this was reduced  to 15 ewes per ha, when repeat  breeders  
were  removed  and managed  separately  for spring  lambing.  Thus,  stocking  rate 
varies  widely  during  the extended  grazing  season,  depending  on the require ­
ments  of the flock.
(2) FODDER  BEET/GRASS  SYSTEM
In the previous  system  ewes were lambed  down in mid January,  managed  
indoor  for one to three weeks  and turned  out to early grass when the risk of 
weather  hazards  had receded.  Flocks  that are lambed  down in December  and 
turned  out to forage  crops  and grass  after lambing  are subject  to unfavourable  
weather  conditions  which  may result  in management  difficulties.  In the period  
1990-91  an indoor  feeding  system  for managing  ewes  and lambs  for 5-6 weeks  
post-lambing  was developed.  This was followed  by pasture  grazing  for late 
lactation  and for finishing  the lambs.  It will be shown  in this report  that early  
lambing  ewes  can be managed  very  effectively  indoor  on a diet  of chopped  roots.  
As a result,  flock  management  at this critical  phase  of the production  cycle  can 
proceed  unhindered  by adverse  weather.  However,  it will also be shown  that 
lamb  growth  rates in late lactation,  when  lambs  were turned  out to pasture,  can 
vary from year to year.
Fodder  beet diet
Ewes  lambing  in early January  were housed  in late November,  fed silage  ad 
libitum  and concentrate  supplements  at the rate of 0.25kg  per ewe per day 
initially,  increasing  to 0.70kg  in the final two weeks  before  lambing.
After  lambing,  the flock  was group  penned  in a straw  bedded  shed  at 20 ewes  
plus their lambs  per pen, stocked  at 1.9 sq. m per ewe. Chopped  fodder  beet 
(cv. Kyros)  was fed ad libitum  and hay was fed as a source  of fibre at the rate 
of 0.35 kg/ewe/day.
Initially,  a protein  supplement  was fed at the rate of 500 g soyabean  meal/  
ewe/day.  However,  the intake  of fodder  beet by the ewes increased  rapidly  and 
after  about  2 weeks  reached  2000  g DM/head/day . This  was higher  than  expected  
and the level  of protein  supplementation  was increased  to 700 g soyabean  meal 
in order  to achieve  a ratio  of about 14 g crude  protein  per MJ of ME in the diet.  
Minerals/vitamins  were  fed at the rate of 50 g/ewe/day.  Lambs  were  creep  fed 
from one week of age.
Management  approach
Although  it was planned  to move  ewes and lambs  to early grass after 5-6 
weeks,  unfavourable  weather  in both years  delayed  turnout  until 8 weeks  post­
lambing,  i.e. early  March.  The  early  grass  consisted  mainly  of perennial  ryegrass  
and some  Italian  ryegrass  rested  since  October  and dressed  with fertiliser  N at
97
the rate of 45kg  N per ha on about  February  1. The basic approach  to grazing  
management  was to optimise  the conditions  for high lamb growth  rates. The 
flock  was grazed  rotationally  by using  portable  electric  fencing  and was moved  
to a new paddock  whenever  the pasture  was grazed  down  to a sward  height  of 
about  4cm. The lambs  were creep  fed until slaughter.
Lambs  were  drafted  for slaughter  from  early April  onwards  as soon as they 
reached  finished  liveweights.  This was assessed  by weighing  and handling  the 
lambs  for light to medium  fat cover  on the loin, rump and tail. Weaning  was 
carried  out in mid-April;  the lambs  were  grazed  selectively  while  the ewes  were  
mob stocked  at 50 ewes per ha.
Lamb  growth  rate
Lamb  performance  results  and concentrate  inputs  are summarised  in Table  
2. Average  lamb growth  rate from birth to 5 weeks  of age was 288g/day  in 
1990  and 257g/day  in 1991.  The reasons  for the lower  growth  rate in 1991 are 
not clear  as the management  system  was similar  in both years and there were  
no apparent  disease  problems;  it may have  been  associated  with  a relatively  high 
proportion  of old ewes in the flock in 1991.

Although  flock  turnout  was delayed  until lambs  were 8 weeks  of age, there  
were no flock health problems  during  the extended  feeding  period  indoor. 
Special  attention  was devoted  to bedding  the pens daily with straw and to 
cleaning  the feed troughs  and drinkers.  Ewes become  accustomed  quickly  to 
fodder  beet after lambing  by introducing  a small  amount  of it in the last week 
of pregnancy  e.g. about 1 kg per head per day.
98
In 1990 lamb  growth  rate during  the finishing  period  on pasture  was 323g/  
day and 70% of lambs  were drafted  at finished  liveweights  during  April,  the 
month  in which  peak prices  prevail.  All lambs  were drafted  by June 1.
Lamb  growth  rate was considerably  lower  in 1991 than in 1990.  As a result,  
the 1991 lambs  were on average  28 days older  than in 1990 when  drafted  for 
slaughter.  The  reduced  growth  rate in 1991 was associated  with  very  high  rainfall  
in April resulting  in waterlogged  ground  conditions  which made grazing  
difficult.  The contrasting  conditions  for lamb thrive  on spring  pasture  in 1990  
and 1991 may be gauged  from the rainfall  recordings  at Oakpark  Research  
Centre  as follows:
Rainfall  (mm)
1990April
20.9
1991 92.3
1981-91  Average 49.4
Although  there is no evidence  that wet weather  affects  pasture  dry matter  
intake by lambs,  it is considered  that prolonged  heavy rain  is stressful  and may 
reduce  lamb  growth  rate. The  rate at which  lambs  were  drafted  in 1991 was slow,  
25%  during  April  compared  with  70% in 1990  (Table  1). In the context  of falling  
prices  as the early season  progresses,  it is clearly  desirable  that the majority  of 
lambs  should  reach finished  liveweights  during  April and early May.
The concentrate  inputs  shown  in Table  2 provide  guidelines  for drawing  up 
feed budgets  for the production  of early season  lambs  on fodder  beet diets fed 
indoor  during  early  lactation,  followed  by finishing  on grazed  pasture.  Concen ­
trate  supplements  fed to ewes  were  higher  in 1991 than in 1990  due to a shortage  
of silage  arising from  summer  drought  and a longer  indoor  feeding  period  post­
lambing.
The consumption  of creep  feed by lambs  up to 6 weeks  of age was low, 4 
to 5kg per head;  intake  increased  subsequently.  In the two years  under  review,  
lambs  consumed  over twice  as much  creep feed in 1991 compared  with 1990  
as shown  in Table 1. It is likely  that this effect  was due to the unsatisfactory  
conditions  for grazing  in 1991, as described  above,  which  in turn resulted  in 
an extended  finishing  period.
The realised  stocking  rate on early grass during  March  was 12.3 ewes per 
ha in 1990 and 12.4 ewes per ha in 1991.
Advantages  of fodder  beet
The main advantages  of fodder  beet as feed for sheep are:
* Both ewes and lambs  have high potential  intakes  of fodder  beets when 
chopped,  equivalent  to over  3% of body  weight. Despite  their  bulky nature,  
sheep  consume  as much  dry matter  in the form of pulped  roots as they 
can on all-concentrate  diets.
* Fodder  beet  can be produced  at about  one-third  of the cost of concentrates.
* Developments  in the design  of harvesters,  fodder  feeders  and diet wagons  
have overcome  the technical  problems  of handling  fodder  beet roots.
99
Conclusion
By housing  early  lambing  flocks  for 5 to 6 weeks  after  lambing,  the weather  
hazards  associated  with turning  out ewes with their  young  lambs  to pasture  or 
root crops  in January  are avoided.  Housing  facilitates  control  over  the manage ­
ment system,  adequate  intakes  of high quality  feed are assured,  lamb growth  
rates are predictable  and labour  efficiency  in feeding  and supervision  are 
enhanced.  Good  housing  facilities  and suitable  machinery  for feeding  roots  are 
essential.  In occasional  years  heavy  rain in spring  may cause  difficult  grazing  
conditions;  temporary  transfer  of the flock  to a dry paddock  elsewhere  and extra  
supplementation  may be necessary.

Grazing  Management  for Sheep
E. J. GRENNAN

The growth  rate of lambs  on pasture  can vary greatly,  depending  on the type  
of pasture  being grazed.  Sward  height  and method  of grazing  (set stocking,  
paddocks, creep  grazing)  may affect  lamb  growth  rate. The requirement  for and 
response  to meal supplementation  at pasture  will also be affected  by pasture  
supply.  The aim of this paper  is to outline  the effects  of grazing  management  
and meal supplementation  on lamb growth  rate pre and post weaning.
Pasture  height
This has been used in grazing  trials  at Belclare  to study  the effect  of grazing  
management  on lamb  growth  rate. In general  sward  height  is a useful  guide  to 
the quantity  of herbage  available  and its suitability  for sheep  grazing.  The rising  
plate  pasture  meter  used  gives  a reliable  measurement  particularly  when  pasture  
is in the vegetative  (leafy)  state. Caution  is needed  with height  measurements  
taken  in late May  and  June  when  pastures  may be getting  stemmy  if undergrazed  
at this time. Stemmy  pasture  can give high readings  for sward  height  but these  
are a poor indicator  of the suitability  of the pasture  for sheep.
Lamb  growth  pre-weaning
■Set stocking:  The first priority  is to have  enough  grass  to meet  the high feed  
demands  of ewes after lambing.  Table 1 shows  the effect  of sward  height  on 
the growth  rate of lambs  set stocked  from birth to weaning  at 14 weeks  of age 
in late  June  (1). Results  show  that a sward  height  of about  6 cm is near  optimum  
until late May when lambs  are about 10 weeks  of age. Tight  grazing  at 4 cm 
reduces  lamb  growth  rate. However,  lax grazing  at 9 cm, which requires  a lower  
stocking  rate, gives  little increase  in lamb  growth.  This lax grazing,  especially  
in May, results  in selective  grazing  by sheep  and the pasture  becoming  quite  
stemmy  in June. This is more obvious  on old permanent  pastures  where  
unpalatable  grasses  such as red fescue  are rejected,  resulting  in the pasture  
developing  a patch-work  appearance  of tightly  grazed  areas  and rejected  high-  
grass areas.  Table 1 also shows  that lamb growth  rate in June (10-14  weeks)  
is lower than in April-May  (0-10 weeks)  at all sward heights  and some  
adjustment  in grazing  management  is required  to maintain  high lamb growth  
rates in June.

Rotational  grazing:  If paddock  grazing  is used, the question  arises  as to how 
tightly  they should  be grazed  before  moving  sheep  to the next  paddock  and what  
effect  this will have  on lamb  growth.  Results  in Table  2 with a ewe lamb  flock  
show  that weaning  weights  were  highest  when  paddocks  were  grazed  down  to 
about  6 cm (2). Very tight grazing  to 3 cm for the 14 weeks  depressed  lamb  
weaning  weight  significantly.  Closer  examination  of these  and  other  results  from  
grazing  trials at Belclare  suggests  that a post-grazing  height  of 6 cm may not 
be appropriate  for April,  May and June.  Grazing  to 4 or 6 cm in April  had little 
effect  on the 5 week  weight  of lambs.  The effect  is more  significant  when  tight 
grazing  is continued  in May and June. This may be explained  by the fact that 
in April  grass  is very  leafy  and high  quality  and so sheep  can graze  tightly  without  
restricting  their  performance.  Later  in May/June  the base  of the sward becomes  
more  stemmy  as the flowering  stems  rise.  Tight  grazing  at this time  forces  lambs  
to eat herbage  of lower  digestibility,  thereby  reducing  their performance.  As 
a general  guide,  post grazing  height  of 4, 5 and 6 cm may be more  appropriate  
for April,  May and June respectively.  For the same reasons  sward  heights  of 
5 and 6 cm may be adequate  in April and May respectively  for set stocking.
Lamb  growth  in June
Records  from many experiments  indicate  that the growth rate of March  born 
lambs  from 10 to 14 weeks  is often  much  lower  than in the period  up to 10 weeks  
of age. This reduced  growth  rate occurs  in late May and June when  ewe milk 
supply  is decreasing  and lambs  are becoming  increasingly  dependent  on pasture.  
This pasture  may either  be getting  stemmy  if undergrazed  in May or it may be 
too short due to drought  or too high stocking  rate. A reduction  of 35 g/day  in 
growth  rate during  this time means  a loss of 1 kg in weaning  weight.  Records  
suggest  that the potential  loss in weaning  weight  ranges  from 1 to 3 kg. Since  
it requires  about 1 week gazing  on good pasture  for weaned  lambs  to gain 1 
kg liveweight,  it follows  that the reduced  growth  rate pre-weaning  can delay  
sale date of finished  lambs  by 1 to 3 weeks.
Results  at Belclare  over  3 years  indicate  that with  some  adjustments  in grazing  
management  it is possible  to keep lamb growth  at a high rate in June. The 
objective  is to offer  lambs  leafy grass  of a high quality  similar  to that normally  
available  in April and May. Three  different  pastures  were grazed  by ewes and

lambs  from 10 to 14 weeks  of age: Pasture  A was set stocked  at 5-6 cm height  
up to 10 weeks  and grazed  at the same  height  in June: Pasture  B was similarly  
grazed  up to late May and at 6-8 cm height  in June: Pasture  C was aftergrass  
(silage  cut mid-May)  and grazed  at 8-9 cm in June. Results  in Table  3 show  
that lamb  growth  rate was affected  by the pasture  being  grazed.  Increasing  the 
height  from  5-6 cm to 6-8 cm improved  growth  rates  considerably,  with  highest  
growth  rates on aftergrass  available  ad lib. It is concluded  that while  a sward  
height  of about  6 cm is adequate  up to about  the end of May for set stocking,  
an increase  in height  is necessary  in June  in order  to maintain  high  lamb  growth  
rates. Tight  grazing  in May  prevents  seed-heads  developing  while  the increased  
height  in June  allows  for the growth  of new leafy  material.  This  increased  height  
in June may be achieved  by applying  nitrogen  in late May  or by increasing  the 
grazing  area, by, for example  including  a paddock  cut for silage  in mid-May.  
The provision  of aftergrass  for weaned  lambs  is generally  desirable  but few 
sheep  fanners  would  be in a position  to have adequate  aftergrass  available  for 
ewes and lambs  in June. In some situations  it might  be possible  to allow the 
lambs  to forward  creep  graze  on the aftergrass  while  the ewes are setstocked.  
Lambs  would  have access  to high quality  pasture  and the area of aftergrass  
required  would  be much smaller.
Creep  feeding  and creep  grazing
The response  of ewes  or lambs  to meal  feeding  in spring  will depend  on the 
supply  of grass available.  Results  from England  suggest  that there is little 
response  to feeding  meals  to ewes  after  lambing  unless sward height  falls below  
about  4 cm for set stocking  (3). At Belclare  O’Riordan  found  no response,  in 
ewes or lambs,  to feeding  250 g/day to ewe lambs  for 5 weeks  after lambing  
when  grazing  down  to 3.0,4.5 or 6 cm in a rotational  grazing  system  (I). When  
the same level of creep  was fed to the lambs  from 5 to 14 weeks  there was a 
response  to creep  with tight grazing  to 3 cm but not with lax grazing  to 6 cm.
In separate  experiments  the effect  of creep feeding  and creep  grazing  was 
investigated  over two seasons  at Belclare.  Pastures  were rotationally  grazed  
down  to either  4 or 6 cm using a ewe lamb flock in Year 1 and mature  ewes  
in Year 2. Creep  feed was fed at the 4 cm height  only from 5 to 14 weeks  at 
250 g/day.  The facility  to creep  graze  was available  at both heights  and availed  
of by lambs  increasingly  from about seven weeks  of age. Results  in Table  4 
show  that tight  grazing  to 4 cm in May-June  restricted  lamb  growth  more  than 
lax grazing  to 6 cm. Lamb  growth  rates  were  improved  by creep  feeding  or creep

grazing.  The average  response  to creep  grazing  was 2.9 kg at 4 cm and 1.7 kg 
at 6 cm, while  the response  to creep  feeding  averaged  3.9 kg at the 4 cm height.
These  results,  taken  in conjunction  with the previous  trials  at Belclare  show  
that the response  to meal  feeding  or creep  grazing  will depend  on sward  height.  
While  very tight grazing  in May/June  is beneficial  in preventing  the pasture  
becoming  stemmy  it does  reduce  lamb  growth  rate, but this can be counteracted  
by creep  feeding  or creep  grazing. The latter  option  may be most  feasible  where  
a paddock  grazing  system  is in use. The response  to either  creep  feeding  or creep  
grazing  will be small where  high quality  pasture  is available  ad lib.
Lamb  growth  post weaning
The  growth  rate  of lambs  on pasture  post  weaning  can vary  greatly  and  reports  
of poor growth  rates on farms are frequent.  Growth  rates under controlled  
conditions  in research  flocks can range from under 100 to over 200 g/day  
depending  on the pasture  being  grazed. Pasture  height,  clover  content,  previous  
grazing  management  and “clean  pasture ” can all affect  the rate of lamb  growth.  
In some farm situations  mineral  deficiencies,  such as cobalt,  or inadequate  
dosing  practices  are blamed.
Set stocking
Table  5 shows  the typical  effect  of pasture  height  on lamb  growth  on pastures  
of low clover  content  and grazed  by sheep  pre-weaning.  A height  of about  9 
cm gives highest  growth  rates in contrast  to about  6 cm in April/May.  Tight

grazing  on summer  pasture  forces  lambs  to graze down into a layer of poor  
quality  herbage  at the base of the sward  resulting  in poor lamb growth  rates.
Rotational  grazing - . ■ u •
Table 6 shows  the general  effect  of grazing  down to different  heights  m 
rotational grazing,  and also  the effect  of different  pastures.  Highest  growth  rates  
are associated  with leafy pasture,  rich in clover.  Growth  rates up to 200 g/day 
can also  be obtained  on aftergrass.  The lower  parasite  levels  on this pasture  may 
account  for the higher  lamb  growth  rates. It is difficult  to get grow*  rates  higher  
than 150 to 170 g/day  on pasture  grazed  by ewes/lambs  up to weaning  (no matter  
how intensive  the dosing  routine).  Grazing  down  below about  6 cm in paddocks  
also reduces  growth  rate as lambs  are forced  to eat poor quality  herbage.  A 
system  of leader/follower  grazing  would  be beneficial  (where  paddocks  ^e 
available)  with  lambs  grazing  ahead  of ewes,  keeping  in mind  the need  to restrict  
the diet of ewes  post weaning  and allow a  build  up of grass for autumn  flushing.
Effect  of grazing  management  pre-weaning
As indicated  earlier,  tight  grazing  in May/June  results  in a more  leafy  pasture  
post weaning.  This can affect  lamb growth  if weaned  lambs  grazed  the same  
area postweaning.  Results  in Table 7 illustrate  this effect at Belclare.  when

weaned  lambs  were  highly  stcx:ked (at pasture  heights  up to 7.5 cm) growth  rates  
were highest  on pasture  grazed  down to 3 cm pre-weaning.  However  when 
weaned  lambs  were grazed on pasture  at about  9 cm lambs  growth  rate was not 
affected  by grazing  height  pre-weaning.  It appears  that at low stocking  rate (9 
cm) lambs  could  select  a similar  diet from  all pastures  but at high stocking  rate 
and shorter  grass  the penalty  for lax grazing  pre-weaning  is evident. The  highest  
growth  rates were  about  160 g/day  on these  pastures  grazed  by ewes/lambs  pre- 
weaning.
Feeding  concentrates  at pasture
As in spring-time  the response  to feeding  concentrates  to weaned  lambs  on 
pasture  will depend  on the quantity  and quality  of the pasture  being  grazed.  The 
response  will be small where pasture  alone supports  a high growth  rate. 
Conversely  the response  will be greater  where  pasture  alone supports  a low 
growth  rate. Results  in Table  8 show the response  of lambs  to feeding  meals  
on pasture  in autumn  at Belclare.  There  is a response  to meals  especially  where  
grass  is short.  The extra  carcass  gain due to meal feeding  would  cover  the cost 
of the meals.  It does allow  lambs  to be  finished  that would  not finish  on pasture  
alone  in autumn  and may otherwise  have  to be sold  as stores.  It also allows  lambs  
to be finished  earlier  and this may be important  if lamb  prices  are falling  at that 
time.

Mixed  grazing
Lamb  growth  rate to weaning  is generally  higher  in mixed  cattle/sheep  than 
in all sheep  grazing  systems.  Weaning  weights  are about  2 kg higher  with  mixed  
grazing  (4). The higher  growth  rates may be attributed  to several  factors  such 
as more  grass  available  to sheep,  including  high grass  areas  around  dung-pats,  
more  nutritious  grass near  dung  pats, more  clover  in mixed-grazed  pastures  and 
lower  parasite  levels.
At Belclare  a similar  2 kg advantage  in weaning  weight  was obtained  when 
ewes/lambs  grazed  pasture  not grazed  by sheep in the previous  year. Due to 
the limited  amount  of silage  required  in all-sheep  systems  it is difficult  to plan 
to have “clean  grazing ” for lambs  in spring.  Clean  grazing  is mainly  required

when  lambs  are eating  an appreciable  quantity  of grass  after 4-5 weeks  of age. 
It would  be useful  for nematodirus  control  to have  “clean  pasture ” available  from  
mid-April  to the end of May.
Dosing  lambs
In all sheep  systems  at Belclare  the routine  dosing  of spring  born lambs  is 
at 5 wks, 10 wks and 14 wks (weaning).  More  intensive  dosing  at I'h and 12 
weeks  gave  no growth-rate  response  up to weaning.  A similar  result  was obtained  
with a ewe lamb flock grazing  the same area in two successive  years.
Post-weaning,  lambs  should  be grazed  on “clean  pasture ” if available.  Dosing  
requirements  will depend  on where  the lambs are  grazing.  On plgan  pasture  one 
dose  about  3 weeks  post-weaning  may  be enough.  If dq clean  grazing  is available  
we dose  lambs  at about  3 week  intervals  in grazing  trials  to minimise  the effect  
of parasites.  More  intensive  dosing  in this situation  (every  17? weeks)  did not 
improve  lambs  growth  compared  with  dosing  at 3 week  intervals  and may only  
increase  the risk of worms  developing  resistance  to the drugs  used.
A guide  to pasture  heights  for sheep
Table  9 gives a  guide  to pasture  heights  for all sheep grazing  for set stocking  
and post-grazing  heights  for rotational  grazing  to achieve  high  lamb  growth  rates  
throughout  the season.

Agriculture  is an important  component  of the New Zealand  economy  where  
it accounts  for over  50%  of export  receipts. Grassland  based  farming,  producing  
animal  products  from  dairying,  sheep  and beef  account  for 36%,  30% and 20% 
of agricultural  export  receipts  respectively.  Many  comparisons  of agricultural  
production  in both Ireland  and New Zealand  have been made which  suggest  
that they are similar.  However,  closer  examination  of geography,  climate  and 
farming  systems  shows  that differences  do exist and that systems  of farming  
have developed  to cope  with the local constraints.  The main  aims of the present  
paper  are firstly  to generally  describe  agriculture  in New Zealand,  secondly  to 
describe  weather  and grass  growth  in the main  livestock  producing  regions  and 
thirdly  to describe  beef production  which  is mainly  based  on grazed  grass.
1. Agriculture  in New Zealand
Some  general  statistics  which  compare  New Zealand  and Ireland  are given  
in Table 1. It can be seen that New ^aland ’s land mass is nearly  four times  
the size of Ireland.  New Zealand  comprises  two main Islands,  with the North  
Island  accounting  for 43% of the land area (Figure  1). Both New Zealand  and 
Ireland  have  a similar  proportion  of their  areas  classified  as mountainous.  Again,  
both countries  have a similar  sized population  with rural/urban  balances  that 
are quite  alike.  The one big difference  between  the two countries  is in average  
farm size, which  in New Zealand  is 220 hectares  (540 acres)  compared  with 
25 hectares  (60 acres)  in Ireland.

Fig 1 - New Zealand  and Agricultural  Distribution
The North  Island  is the most  intensively  populated  and farmed  part of New  
Zealand  (Table  2). The majority  of New Zealand ’s dairy  cattle  (90%),  almost  
80% of the beef  cattle  and 50% of the sheep  numbers  are farmed  on the North  
Island.  Three  quarters  of New Zealand  people  live on the North  Island.
There  are approximately  4.5 million  beef cattle  in New Zealand  of which  
1.4 million  are breeding  cows and heifers.  Angus,  Hereford  and their crosses  
account  for 70% of beef cow breeds  (Table  3). Very few farmers  devote  
themselves  exclusively  to beef  production.  In general,  the raising  and finishing  
of beef is carried  on in conjunction  with sheep  farming.  The dairy sector  has 
a major  part to play in the New Zealand  beef industry.  Presently,  50% of beef 
is of dairy  origin.  Calving  in the beef  cow  herd  is planned  to coincide  with  spring  
grass  growth.  Grazed  grass  is the main diet throughout  the year  and while some  
limited  amounts  of hay or silage  may be offered,  no meal supplements  are fed. 
Winter  housing  of animals  is virtually  non-existent  in New Zealand.
Virtually  all animal production  systems  in New Zealand  are based on 
grassland,  either  grazed  or to a much  lesser  extent  conserved  as hay or silage. 
Clover  is the sward  component  that plays  a important  role in grassland  produc ­
tivity.  Clovers  are present  in nearly  all swards  and the use of fertiliser  nitrogen  
is limited.  However,  there is a renewed  interest  in nitrogen  use in autumn  and 
spring  to overcome  the sometimes  unreliable  productivity  of clovers  at these  
times  of the year. While  grass growth  patterns  vary with the season,  although

2. Weather  and grass growth  in New Zealand
New  Zealand  may simply  be described  as a “long narrow ” country  situated  
between  latitude  34° and 47° South  of the equator  and.at  approximately  165- 
180° East longitude.  For comparison  purposes,  its position  relative  to Ireland  
has been simplified  in Figure  2, where  New  Zealand  has been  moved  and placed  
at the same co-ordinates  North (of the equator)  as it occupies  South  of the 
equator.  From  this figure,  it can be  seen that the “North  Island ” coincides  mainly 
with central  and Southern  Spain.  The Auckland  region  would  be situated  close  
to Gibraltar  with  some  lands  stretching  as far South  as Morocco  in North  Africa. 
New Zealand's  capital  city, Wellington  which  is located  on the Southern  end 
of the North Island would now approximate  to Spains  capital,  Madrid.  The 
“South  Island ” would  stretch  from  the North  Spai  n/Portugal border  over  the Bay 
of Biscay  into the Atlantic  Ocean,  but would  not come as far North  as Brittany/  
Normandy  in France.  The nearest  regions  of New  Zealand  would be some  200- 
250 miles  South  of the Irish South  Coast.  Because  of its location  closer  to the
no
Ill
equator,  the sun is more  directly  overhead  than in Ireland.  This means that  solar  
radiation  is higher.  This is critical  for grass growth.
Because  New  Zealand  is a “narrow”  shaped  country,  its climate  is to a large  
extent  influenced  by the seas that surround  it. As a large  proportion  (approxi ­
mately  50%) of the South  Island  is covered  by mountains  (Southern  Alps),  this 
greatly  modifies  the climate.  The tall mountain  ranges  that run the entire  length  
of the South  Island  have  a large  influence  on both  rainfall  and temperature.  These  
influences,  as well as the fact that Ireland  is warmed  by the Gulf  stream,  makes  
the expected  differences  in climate  less than their relative  locations  in Figure  
2 might  suggest.
North  Island
Grass growth  data for the North Island are shown in Figures  3 and 4. 
Meteorological  data are shown  in Figures  6 and 7. For comparisons  the grass  
growth  curve  for Moorepark  is shown  and this site may be seen as one of the 
most  favourable  locations  in Ireland  for grass  production.  Seasonal distribution  
of grass growth  is shown  in Figure  8.
In general,  compared  with  Ireland,  grass  growth  rates  on New  Zealand's  North  
Island  are lower  in summer  and higher  in winter,  thus, giving  a more uniform  
seasonal  grass  supply.  In the Hamilton  region,  average  winter  grass  growth  rates  
are approximately  14 kg DM/ha/day.  Grass  growth  is at a minimum  in June/  
July (winter)  and increases  gradually  during  late July to reach  a peak of 50-60  
kg DM/ha/day  in September/October/November.  Growth  rates decrease  in 
January  (summer),  but seldom  fall below  20 kg DM/ha/day  until mid winter. 
Approximately  '/3 of the annual  grass production  takes place in winter  and 
autumn  (Figure  8). Rainfall  is relatively  high and well distributed  throughout  
the year. Average  winter  temperatures  (June/July/August)  are approximately  
9°C (Figure  6).
In the Palmerston  North region (Figure  4), winter,  summer  and autumn  
growth  rates are similar  at 20-24  kg DM/ha/day,  representing  over half of the 
season ’s grass  growth.  Grass  growth  reaches  a maximum  of approximately  70 
kg DM/ha/day  in October/  November.  Due to drought  effects  and the approach  
of autumn,  growth  rates can drop to less than 20 kg DM/ha/day,  but increase  
again during the winter. Winter  temperatures  average  8°C and rainfall  is 
generally  well distributed  throughout  the year.
Grass growth  occurs  in New Zealand ’s North  Island  throughout  the year. 
Winter  temperatures  (December,  January  and February)  at Moorepark  and 
Grange  average  5.2 °C and 4.4'^C,  respectively.  Corresponding  winter  (June, 
July and August)  temperature  in the Hamilton  region  is 9.2°C  and at Palmerston  
North  is 7.8°C.  Soil temperatures  closely  reflect  these  differences,  and there  is 
generally  no grass growth  at soil temperatures  less than 5 to 6°C. These  
differences  in temjreratures  result  in a more even supply  of grass throughout  
the year in New ^aland.  It can be clearly  seen in Figures  3 and 4 that New 
Zealand  have  an advantage  in terms  of grass  supply  in early spring  when  growth  
rates can be at least double  those  of Ireland.  During  the autumn.  New Zealand  
again has the advantage.  It is only during  the summer  months  that Ireland

produces  more  grass.  It is under  these  conditions,  favourable  to pastoral  farming,  
that most of New Zealand ’s cattle are farmed.
South  Island
The main grassland  based  farming  region  of the South  Island  is Southland,  
which  supports  a large  proportion  of New Zealand  sheep population.  A typical 
grass  growth  pattern  over the season  (Figure  5) shows  the growth  curve  for the 
Invermay  Research  Centre.  Grass  growth  rates during  June/July  (winter)  are 
typically  less than 10 kg DM/ha/day.  During  August,  growth  rates increase  to 
reach a peak in October  of about 60 kg DM/ha/day.  Growth  rates fall off 
gradually  during  November  through  to April when they reach approximately  
20 kg DM/ha/day.  Growth  rates during  May are typically  10 kg DM/ha/day.  
One third of the annual  grass growth  take place in autumn  and winter.  The 
remaining  seasons  production  in the spring  and summer  accounts  for 23 and 
47% of seasonal  growth  (Figure  8).
Temperatures  on the southerly  regions  of the South  Island  (Southland)  are 
more like those  of Ireland  than of the North  Island.  The January  equivalent  in 
Southland  has similar  temperatures  to Irish Southern  regions,  but is one degree  
centigrade  warmer  than for example  Grange.  During  the equivalent  month  of 
February  in New Zealand,  Southland  is 1-2°C  warmer  than Ireland.  When  this 
difference  means  temperatures  of 4 or 5°C in Ireland  compared  with  6°C in New 
Zealand,  it is of major  significance  for grass growth.  It in effect means  the

difference  between  grass growth  and no growth.  This is probably  best under ­
stood  if these  differences  are put into context.  February  1993 remains  clear in 
most peoples  minds as being a remarkably  mild month. The average  air 
temperature  during  February  1993 at Grange  was 6°C compared  with the more  
normal  4°C. This exceptional  Irish  February  is the normal  average  temperature  
in Southland  (which  in turn is inferior  to the North  Island  of New Zealand).  
Probably  in most  farmers ’ minds  if February  1993 was the normal,  then much  
more use would  be made of grazed  grass.
During  spring  (March  and April),  the differences  in temperature  between  
Ireland  and New  Zealand  become  greater.  The importance  of these  temperature  
differences  cannot  be overstated,  as growth  of grass is very sensitive  to tem­
perature  changes  at this time  of the year.  For  the remainder  of the year.  Southland  
temperatures  are similar  to those  of the Southern  part  of Ireland.  However,  grass

growth  in the autumn  is better  in Southland,  reflecting  the longer  days  and higher  
solar radiation  due to its closer  proximity  to the equator  than Ireland.
3. Beef production  in New Zealand
There  are approximately  30,000  beef  and sheep  farmers  in New  Zealand  that 
have  more  than 250 sheep  or 50 beef  cattle.  Less than  6,000  farmers  derive  their  
income  solely  from beef production.  Therefore,  in nearly  all situations,  beef 
cattle  and sheep  are farmed  as joint enterprises.  On the more  extensive  North  
Island  Hill country,  cattle  may account  for 25-30%  of the livestock  units  on the 
farm,  on better  lands  cattle  may  make  up 30-35%  of the stock.  While,  on average,  
beef  cattle  make  up 30%  of livestock  units  on the North  Island,  the corresponding  
figure  for the South  Island  is 5-15%.  While  the overall  average  farm  size in New  
Zealand  is 220 ha (540 acres),  those engaged  in drystock  farming  occupy  
holdings  that average  490 ha ( 1,200 acres).  Such a farm employs  1.6 labour  
units  (including  the farmer)  who  manage  on average  2,600  sheep  and 180 cattle.  
A “typical ” drystock  farm may comprise  25% flat land, 25% rolling  country  
and 50% steep  hill. These  farms  produce  lamb and beef  carcases  of 14 kg and 
250 kg, respectively.
The New Zealand  beef  industry  obtains  its raw materials  from two sources,  
the suckler  herd which  comprises  approximately  1.4 million cows  and the dairy  
herd  which  comprises  2.2 million  cows  of mainly  Friesian  and Friesian  x Jersey  
breeds.  Beef  produced  from the dairy herd is almost  exclusively  raised  as 15- 
22 month  bull beef, while steers are produced  from the suckler  herd.
Beef  cow breeds  are the traditional  Angus  (30%),  Hereford  (15%)  and their  
crosses  (25%)  (Table  3). Hereford  and Angus  sires  are the most  commonly  used 
bulls  in beef  production.  Calves  from  the dairy  herd,  mainly  males,  make  a major  
contribution  to the beef industry  (Table  4). The predominant  breeds  of cow in 
the dairy industry  are Friesian  (66%)  and Jersey (26%),  with Friesian  (and 
Jersey)  sires  widely  used.  Many  of the Jersey  male  calves  are slaughtered  shortly  
after birth.
The ratio  of cattle  to sheep,  the time of selling  and animal  weights  are very

much dependent  on the type of land and the proportions  of flat and easily  
managed  lowlands  to steep hill country.  Production  systems  thus vary, and 
depending  on price  and herbage  supply  selling  dates  may vary widely  between  
years.
High  hill country:  Most  cows  are mated  to Hereford  or Angus  sires;  terminal  
sires such as the Charolais  or Simmental  would  account  for less than 10% of 
matings.  Very  few farmers  would  mate  all cows  to terminal  sires.  Selling  patterns  
vary widely.  Some  or all of the weanlings  may  be sold before  winter  where the 
buyer is normally  farming  on better lowlands.  Some producers  carry their  
progeny  over  the winter  and may sell in spring  when  prices  are normally  highest  
yet others may wait until late spring/summer  and sell at heavier  weights.  
Generally,  animals  are not finished  on the high hill country.  Suckler  cow herd 
size on the hill country  is typically  70-90  cows.
Easier  (gently  rolling)  hill country:  Suckler  cows,  again,  with sheep  are 
farmed  on these  more  easily  managed  hills and are often  managed  with another  
drystock  enterprise.  These  drystock  may be steers  or surplus  females  from  the 
high hill country  or may be bulls bought  from the dairy industry.  Heifers  are 
finished  at 15-18  months  of age while  bulls  are sold  at 18-22  months  with  carcase  
weights  of approximately  280 kg.
Good  flatlands:  While  sheep  are again  farmed,  the beef  enterprise  tends  to 
be specialised.  Producing  bull beef  or finishing  steers  purchased  from the hill 
country  is common.
Some  typical  cow  weights  during  the year  are shown  in Table  5 and are lower  
than those  on most Irish farms.  At weaning  time a bodyweight  of 450 kg for 
Angus  or Hereford  cows  is common.  Between  weaning  and mid/late  winter  cows  
may lose up to 10-15%  of their  bodyweight.  On many  farms  cows  at this  stage  
of the production  cycle are used as pasture  cleaners  where  they are offered  
whatever  herbage  is remaining  after  the ewe flock,  especially  during  the mating  
season.  During  the winter  pregnant  ewes and cows  are seen  as the least  sensitive  
animals  to changes  in herbage  supply  as growing  stock (lambs/hoggets  and 
weanlings/yearlings)  are offered  first choice  of pasture.  Weight  losses  of the

order  of 10-15%  are seen as reasonable  provided  it takes  place  before  4 weeks  
pre calving.  Bodyweights  at calving  for the Angus  and Hereford  type cows  are 
normally  in the range  440-480  kg. After  calving  cows  are gradually  introduced  
to spring  grass and over the first 4 weeks  of lactation  cow bodyweights  may 
be reduced  to 400 kg. As grass  growth  improves  (spring-September  to Novem ­
ber) bodyweight  recovers  and will reach  a peak in December/January.  Mating  
takes place  during  November/December  when the cows are on an increasing  
plane  of nutrition.  Weaning  takes  place  in February/March.  Both  cows  and ewes  
are normally  set stocked  during  spring/summer.  Calf weights  at weaning  are 
in the range  200-250  kg.
Bull beef production
Of all the beef  production  systems  practised  in New Zealand,  finishing  bull 
calves  from the dairy herd is the most clearly  defined  and managed  system.  
Production  of steer  beef,  from  the suckler  herd,  is less well  defined  and somewhat  
like Ireland  involves  a fair degree  of animal  movement  between  farms  during  
the animals  lifetime.  The bull beef system  involves  raising  bulls (Friesian)  
purchased in October  (spring)  at weights  ranging  from 85 to 100 kg and feeding  
outdoors  on grass until they are 15-22 months  old, producing  carcases  in the 
weight  range  230-280  kg. Bulls  are managed  in groups  of20-40  and are generally
119
set stocked  during  summer  and rotationally  grazed  during  winter.  Management  
problems  in relation  to animal  behaviour  are not seen as an important  issue.  
Animal  stocking  rates on these bull beef systems  are usually  less than 3 to 4 
bull/ha  (1.5/acre).  Performance  is closely  associated  with grass supply  and on 
bull finishing  units regular  assessments  of pasture  cover/mass  are made.
The effect  of stocking  rate on liveweight  gain is shown  in Figure  9. Stocking  
bulls at 5 to 6/ha over the year resulted  in little gain during  the winter  month  
(April-September)  when  animals  were 150-200  kg at the beginning  of winter. 
At 6 bulls/ha  animals  maintained  liveweight  and at 5 bulls/ha  gained  approxi ­
mately  25 kg. During  the winter  period  bulls stocked  at 4/ha gained  0.2 kg/ 
head/day  while  those stocked  at 3/ha achieved  a gain of 0.5 kg/head/day.  To 
achieve  satisfactory  lifetime  gains bulls are therefore  stocked  at 3/ha or less. 
An example  of a typical  bull beef  unit is the 105 ha (260 acres)  farm  at Massey  
University.  The unit is made up of 31 paddocks  ranging  in size from 1.3 to 
6.1 ha (3 to 15 acres)  based on a permanent  ryegrass/white  clover  mixture.  
Rainfall  is about  1000  mm (40 inches)  and  is evenly  spread  throughout  the year. 
Nitrogen  may be used in the autumn  (April)  and in 1990 it represented  20 kg 
N/ha  in the form  of urea. In autumn  1991,40  kg N/ha  was applied  with  a further  
22 kg N/ha in July (late winter).  Friesian  bull calves  are purchased  during  
October/November  (Table  6), and prices  have  ranged  from  $120  to $303 (£60- 
£150).  Bulls  are sold during  December  to March  at 15-20  months  of age (Table  
7). The disposal  pattern  for the 1991/92  production  season  is shown  in Table  
8. During  the years  1983/84  to 1987/88  where  bulls  were  stocked  at 3/ha  average  
carcase  weight  was 223 kg. But when  stocking  rates were reduced  to 2.5 bulls/  
ha during  the years 1988/89  to 1991/92  average  carcase  weight  increased  to 
254 kg and has been  increasing  yearly.  During  the corresponding  periods  carcase  
output  had declined  from 723 to 670 kg/ha,  but price per head had increased  
from NZ$444  to NZ$692.

Herbage  supply  has a major  influence  on the growth  rate of bulls within  the 
system  as can be seen from Figures  9,10 and 11. The production  year 1986/  
87 (Table  7) was characterised  by a low herbage  mass which  for most of the 
year  was less than 1,400  kg DM/ha  (Figure  10). Animal  performance  was poor  
(Figure  10 and Table  7) and carcase  weights  averaged  208 kg. The following  
year (1987/88)  the weather  pattern  resulted  in herbage  production  that was 
improved  and pasture  mass was seldom  less than 1,400 kg DM/ha.  Animal  
performance  was greatly  improved  and carcase  weights  were increased  by 25 
kg/head.

Seasonality  of production
Although  grassland  is grazed  throughout  the year,  there  is nevertheless  a clear  
seasonality  to beef  production.  The slaughtering  at export  plants  over the year 
is shown  in Figure  12. Data for Ireland  are shown  for comparison.  A smaller  
proportion  of the New Zealand  kill of steers  and heifers  takes place  in winter  
than in Ireland.  Peak  killing  takes  place  in late summer  and autumn.  The ratio 
between  the minimum  and maximum  kill is at least as wide as observed  in 
Ireland.  The seasonality  of production  is to a large  extent  a reflection  of (a) the 
seasonality  of calving  where  virtually  all beef  cows  calf  in spring  at the beginning  
of the grass growth  period  and (b) the production  of beef from grazed  grass.
Conclusions
There  are similarities  between  Ireland  and New Zealand  in factors  such as 
the importance  of grassland  for animal production,  the contribution  of the dairy

industry  to beef  production  and the fact that agricultural  production  in general  
is seasonal.  There  are however,  differences  that make direct  extrapolation  of 
New Zealand  production  practices  to Ireland  more difficult.  Chiefly  among  
those  is climate.  The North  Island  of New  Zealand  where  90%  of the dairy  cows  
and almost  80% of beef animals  are farmed  does have a warmer  climate  than 
Ireland.  Grass  growth  does take place  all year round  with winter  growth  rates  
generally  greater  than 10-15 kg DM/ha/day.
Average  farm and herd size in New Zealand  is much  larger  than in Ireland.  
Dairy  herds approximate  to 170 cows/farm,  likewise,  suckler  herd size is 60- 
100 cows  on North  Island  hill country.  Clearly  economics  of scale  are important  
when comparing  those  enterprise  between  Ireland  and New Zealand.
Soil on the New  Zealand  hills are quite  different  from  those  of Ireland.  North  
Island  soils are largely  influenced  by volanic  activity  and many  of these  soils 
where  adequately  fertilised  are quite  productive.  In an Irish context,  such hill 
soil would  be seen as good mineral  soils.
Beef  production  is derived  from two sources,  the national  suckler  herd and 
the male  progeny  of the dairy herd. Steer  beef  is produced  from  the suckler  herd 
while  bull beef slaughtered  at 15-22  months  of age is almost  exclusively  from 
the dairy herd.

Animal  production  in New Zealand  involving  dairying,  sheep  and beef on 
grazed  grass  accounts  for 85%  of agricultural  receipts. Many  comparisons  have  
been made  of agricultural  production  in both Ireland  and New Zealand  which  
suggest  that they are similar.  However,  closer examination  of geography,  
climate  and farming  systems  reveal  differences  and show  that  systems  of farming  
have developed  independently  to cope with local constraints.
The  present  report  presents  information  on a number  of areas  relating  to sheep  
production  in NZ. Firstly,  reference  is made  to grass growth.  Secondly,  sheep  
production  which  is totally  grass based is described.  Thirdly,  some research  
developments  of relevance  to current  practices  in Ireland  are outlined.
Grass  growth  and weather
New  Zealands  location south  of the equator  approximates  to Spain's  position  
north  of the equator.  However,  because  of New ^aland's  location  in the south  
seas and its own geography,  climate  is modified  and varies  with location.  The 
North  Island  has average  temperatures  that are 3 to 5°C warmer  than Ireland  
and soil temperature  in the main grassland  regions  seldom falls below 6 to 8°C. 
The threshold  temperature  for grass growth  is 6°C. Thus grass grows  all year 
round  and on the North  Island  grass growth  seldom  falls below 10 kg DM/  
hectare/day.
Details  on the characteristics  of grass  growth  in NZ are described  separately  
by E. G. O’Riordan  in this Journal  (see Beef  Production  From New Zealand  
Grasslands).  Grass growth  rates throughout  the year do not show the large  
fluctuations  as observed  in Ireland.  While  the climate  on the southern  end of 
the South  Island  is more  similar  to Ireland  it nevertheless  has more  favourable  
grass growth  in spring  and autumn/winter.
Drop in sheep  numbers
NZ’s land  area  is nearly  4 times  the size  of Ireland.  Of a total  area  of 26 million  
ha, about  13m ha is in pastoral  land  with  two-thirds  of the livestock  units  carried  
on lowland  or rolling  terrain,  one-third  in the hill country  and l%-2%  on the 
high country.  About  40% of land is classed  as hill.
The total sheep  population  in 1992 was 52.5 million,  with a decline  of 18% 
since 1987. Relatively  poor returns  from sheepmeat,  wool and skins are con­
tributing  to the decline  in sheep  numbers.  In the South  Island  there have been 
sheep  farm  conversions  to dairying.  Herd  owners  and share  milkers  have  moved  
down  from  the North  Island  to develop  and establish  large  dairy  farm  enterprises

(300-500  cows).  This pattern  has been stimulated  by lower  land prices  on the 
South  Is., by the profit  margins  in milk and by confidence  in a secure  market.  
There  were 300 dairy farm conversions  up to 1993 with a further  140 planned  
at the time.
Lamb  prices
Table 1 shows  the schedule  prices  for lamb.  Carcass  weights  are typically  
from 12.5 kg to 16 kg at 14-18  weeks of age. Lamb  prices  in 1992/93  averaged  
IR£13  per head with the tops making  IRE  17.
Sheep  and goat meat  production  is 585,000  tonnes  carcass  weight  equivalent  
of which  460,000  tonnes  are exported.
Labour
Table  2 shows  the number  of flocks  classified  by size. Labour  units  per farm  
are often 1.5 to 2.0 on the larger  hill farms  but it is cbmmon  for many  owners/  
operators  to manage  3500 stock units on their own (one stock unit = one 55 
kg breeding  ewe), with the use of a motor  cycle and dogs for mustering  and 
family  assistance  for seasonal  work. -  ’'
On the majority  of NZ farms,  sheep  and beef  production  take place  together.  
Traditionally,  in relation  to drystock,  NZ is a sheep  producing  country.  On most  
North  Island  farms  beef  cattle  (suckler  cows)  account  for less than 35% of the 
livestock  units.  Very  few farms  have  beef  as the only  enterprise.  The proportions  
of sheep  and cows,  in conjunction  with the age and weight  of cattle  at sale, are 
largely  influenced  by the amount  of good  lowland,  easily  managed  hill and steep  
hills on the farms.

Low costs
Primary  production  of meat and wool is the mainstay  of the NZ sheep  
industry.  Production  per ha remains  a basic  principle  for maximising  whole  farm  
profitability.  Low cost sheep  grazing  systems  were developed  to enable  NZ 
farmers  to survive  on returns  from  the international  market  place.  The efficient  
matching  of pasture  feed supply with seasonal  feed demand  using proven  
techniques  of grazing  management  and control  of internal  parasites  is a key 
management  principle.  These  principles  contribute  significantly  to the manage ­
ment  of long term production  and profit  and to the management  of long term 
risk.
Low cost is a key principle  and sheep  systems  are essentially  low input.  The 
concept  of grazed grass as the sole diet together  with economy  of scale  
predominates.  Typically  the main inputs  are aimed  at labour  efficiency.  (1) A 
4-wheeled  motor  bike; (2) Trained  dogs; (3) Fencing;  (4) Easy care ewes that 
receive  no attention  at lambing;  (5) Wool  shed  and handling  pens.  Without  these  
inputs  it would  be impossible  to farm much  of the land. Machinery  and farm  
buildings  are noticeable  by their absence.  Fertilizer  N is not used.
Lamb  finishing  farms
These  farms  are often in the 100-300  ha range  and carry stocking  rates of 
16 to 18 stock units per ha in the very fertile  areas of the North  Is. and 10 to 
20 stock units per ha in Southland,  one of the most densely  populated  sheep  
areas in NZ. Sources  of supply  for stock in the North  Is. are the hill country  
for young  or cast for age Romney  ewes and weaner  steers  and dairy farms  for 
Friesian  and cross-bred  bulls.
A typical  South  Is. intensive  meat  and wool producing  farm is about  200 ha 
in size, of undulating  topography  and responsive  to lime and fertilisers  contain ­
ing molybdenum,  phosphorus  and sulphur.  Stock  consists  of about  2000  ewes,
127
650 ewe hoggets,  40 rams  and 50 to 70 beef  cattle.  Hence,  with a total of about  
2900 stock units, the farm is stocked  at the rate of 14 stock units per ha.
Lambing  percentage  is 125%.  The  flock  is set stocked  until  weaning;  weaning  
weight  is 25 kg. After  weaning,  lambs  are divided  into forward,  medium  and 
light  groups  and grazed  on hay or silage  aftermaths  or chicory,  a specially  sown 
crop which  is resistant  to drought.  Lamb  growth  rate is 200 g/day.  Lambs  are 
drafted  at 3-week  intervals  at 35-40  kg liveweight.  Average  carcass  weight  is 
16 kg.
Clover
White  clover  has traditionally  been the king pin of NZ grazing  systems.  Its 
high digestibility  characteristics  combined  with a high protein  content  ensures  
better  lamb growth  rates than all-grass  swards,  i.e. 320 g/day and 275 g/day  
respectively  according  to results  at Lincoln  College,  Canterbury.  Moreover,  
there are relatively  large differences  in gut fill and killing-out  percentage  in 
favour  of lambs  finished  off clover  swards.  A new variety  “Demand ” has been  
developed  which  produces  significant  growth  in the NZ winter.
Direct  drilling  has proved  to be an effective  method  for replacing  clover  in 
existing  pastures  which  have deteriorated  over time. Special  inverted  T drill 
openers  have  been  developed.  The  critical  points  of management  for the success  
of the technique  are:
1. Remove  competition  from  grasses  by overall  or band spraying  depending  
on the condition  of the existing  pasture.
2. Control  the depth  of sowing;  1-1 ‘/2 cm is ideal.
3. Do not sow clover  at less than 10°C
4. Control  pests and grubs with insecticides  and slug pellets.
5. Graze  regularly  during  the first  6 months  to prevent  clover  suppression  from  
tall grass.
Grass  budgeting
Otago-Southland  at the southern  end of the South  Is. is one  of the most  densely  
populated  sheep  areas of NZ producing  about  40% of NZ’s export  lamb.  The 
region is characterised  by long cold winters  and cool moist summers.  The 
traditional  winter  feeding  systems  based on hay and basic crops have been 
replaced  during  the past 20 years  by grazed grass.  An all-grass  farming  concept  
was developed  from research  investigation  into rotation  lengths,  autumn  saved  
pasture  and the effects  of trampling.  Grass  feed rationing,  increased  stocking  
rates and lambing  percentages  using  grass  budgeting  and electric  fencing  have 
benefited  farmers  through  lower  winter  feed costs.  Over  a 95 day winter,  sheep  
are grazed  at the rate of 250 ewes per ha in daily shifts.
Hill country
Some 8000 of the 21,300  sheep/beef  farms with over 750 stock units are 
classified  as hill country.  About  85% of them  are situated  in the North Is., 400-  
700 ha in size and carry 8 to 10 stock units per ha. Cattle  ratios  are generally
128
1 beast  to 10 sheep.  It is common  for an owner/operator  to run  3500  stock  units  
on his own. Electric  fencing  is widely  used and many 400 ha farms have  
increased  the number  of paddocks  from 30 to 60, giving  better  control  and 
utilisation  of pasture.
South  Island  hill country  farms  are larger,  up to 1700 ha. Fine wool sheep  
breeds  are run at 3-4 stock units per ha.
High country  farms
These  are situated  at higher  altitudes  in the South  Is. with extensive  tussock  
grassland  grazing  and are subject  to severe  weather  hazards.  They  occupy  15% 
of NZ farmland;  average  size is 11,000  ha and flock  size is 8000  sheep.  Rainfall  
varies  from  250 mm in Otago  to 10,000  mm in the Main  Divide.  Wool  provides  
60-70%  of the income  with store stock  sold. Stocking  rates vary from 1 sheep  
per 1.5 ha to 1 sheep  per 4 ha.
Easy care ewes
The most popular  breed is the Romney,  an English  breed, but further  
developed  in NZ as a dual purpose  breed  for both meat and wool production.  
It has been cross-bred  with the coarser  wooled  Border  Leicester  from which  
the Coopworth  has been developed  for higher  fertility,  meat  and wool produc ­
tion. Research  and development  on this breed  at Lincoln  College,  Canterbury  
includes a  sire reference  scheme  using A.l. and laparoscopy  and 30 cooperating  
breeders.  Selection  pressure  is intense  for fertility,  growth  rate and clean  fleece  
weight;  only 2 sires are selected  from a recorded  pool of 350-400  sires.
Easy care means  that ewes lamb  down  unassisted  - there is no intervention  
by the stockman.  Selection  for this trait has been on-going  for many  years  and 
has resulted  in improvements  in mothering  ability.  The Coopworth  is an 
example.
The Perindale  (Romney  x Cheviot)  is another  crossbred  type developed  to 
suit local conditions.  It is hardier  than the  Romney,  bred for survival  in the high 
country  and has ‘easy care ’ attributes.
Most  flocks  are self-contained  with up to 50% of the ewes  being  mated  with 
sires of their  own  breed  and the remainder  with terminal  sires such as Suffolk,  
Hampshire  Down  or Texel.
Responses  to removal  of subsidies
The removal  of subsidies  in the mid 80’s forced  farmers  to change  their 
management  policies  in order  to maintain  farm viability.  All non-production  
costs were terminated  e.g. chemical  sprays  (‘some  Jobs  just were not done ’). 
Fixed  costs and machinery  expenditure  were severely  curtailed.  Hired  labour  
was terminated.
Some  farms  had insufficient  units of production,  hectares  of land or stock  
numbers  to maintain  profitability  under  the existing  cost structure;  some  farms  
were over capitalised.  As a result  there has been considerable  restructuring  in 
terms  of farm size. It is now considered  that an economically  viable  hill farm 
for one labour  unit is 400 ha compared  with 100 ha 20 years ago.
129
There  was also  a sharp  re-focus  on choice  of expenditure  for the best  financial  
returns.  Policy  changes  on the farm involved:  (i) reduction  in sheep  numbers  
in order  to improve  the quality  of the remainder;  (2) increase  in cattle  numbers  
and a greater  proportion  of young  stock  finished  on the farm;  (3) introduction  
of a bull beef enterprise  on some farms  to increase  whole  farm profitability;
(4) diversification  into forestry,  deer or fruit enterprises.
Lean meat growth-measurement  service
The meat  processing  industry  in NZ requires  heavier,  leaner  lamb.  Farmers  
have used husbandry  and management  methods  to partially  meet the market  
requirements  but presently  well designed  breeding  programmes  will provide  
superior  rams to lamb  producers.  The result  of this research  is an index  which  
incorporates  liveweight,  fat depth  and muscle  depth.  An index  value  is calculated  
for each animal.  The index  values  of individual  animals  together  with fat and 
muscle  depths  are returned  to breeders  in a ranking  list to assist  with selection  
and sale.  By using  the animals  with  the highest  values  within  the breeder ’s flock,  
the breeder  makes  genetic  progress  for lean meat growth.
Resistance  to anthelmintics
The desire  to eliminate  worm  drenching  in NZ flocks  arises,  not because  of 
the cost but because  of the emergence  of resistance  to anthelmintics.  Moreover  
there is increasing  consumer  concern  regarding  chemical  residues  in food.
Regular  drenching  at 3-week  intervals  post-weaning  is considered  in NZ to 
be a strong contributory  factor to the development  of resistance  in worm 
parasites.  Similar  trends  have  been  observed  in the U.K. New  Zealand  research ­
ers are attempting  to develop  new  sheep  production  systems  aimed  at eliminating  
the need  for drenching  by: (1) using  sheep  that are genetically  selected  for worm 
parasite  resistance  and, (2) using  grazing  methods  that minimise  worm  larvae  
ingestion.
This twin pronged  approach  embraces  both breeding  and management  
strategies.  The sheep  breeding  trials involve  progeny  testing  and selection  of 
Romney  breeding  stock  for low faecal  egg output  of Haemonchus,  Ostertagia,  
Trichostrongyloids  and Nematodirus  species.  Faecal  samples  from  the progeny  
of rams selected  for resistance  or non-resistance  are examined  on a monthly  
basis.  The resistant  sheep  have  relatively  low faecal egg  output.  The heritability  
of worm  resistance  has been estimated  at 33%.
But without  suitable  grazing  management  the worm  challenge  is still high. 
Incompatibility  between  sheep and cattle nematodes  is being exploited  by 
introducing  cattle  to the grazing  rotation  in order  to reduce  larval  ingestion  by 
sheep.  In this way, it is considered  that the worm  parasite  cycle  for sheep  can 
be broken.  From  lambing  until weaning  at 12 weeks  of age, cattle  are grazed  
on part of the farm, with the ewes plus lambs  grazing  behind  them in a leader/  
follower  fashion.  After  weaning,  the lambs  are transferred  to fresh pasture  on 
the remainder  of the farm.
Fig. 1 shows  the results  of a trial in which  equal numbers  of lambs  sired by 
resistant  and non-resistant  rams were managed  together  in the same grazing

system.  In the early  part of the sheep production  year  there  was little difference  
between  the two categories  of lambs  either  in faecal  egg count  or in liveweight  
gain, because  the pasture  was relatively  clean. After weaning  in February,  
however,  non-resistant  lambs  had up to 2000  eggs  per gram  compared  with  under  
500 eggs in resistant  lambs.  As a result,  the liveweight  gains of non-resistant  
lambs  declined  whereas  resistant  lambs  continued  to thrive.  The non-resistant  
lambs  were eventually  drenched  for welfare  reasons.
As there are no new types of worm  drenches  on the horizon  this research  
will be watched  with interest.

Introduction
The purpose  of my visit to New Zealand  in February  1993 was threefold;-
(1) To attend  the XVII  International  Grassland  Congress  which  was held at 
Massey  University,  Palmerston  North  and subsequently  at Hamilton.
(2) To visit  research  organisations  and university  faculties  engaged  in research  
on grassland  and animal  production,  particularly  dairying.
(3) To visit dairy farms in the North and South  Islands  and observe  New  
Zealand  grassland  farming  in practice.
International  Grassland  Congress
There  was  a large  attendance  (1400) at the Congress  from all over  the world.  
The main theme  of the Congress  was sustainable  animal  production  from the 
grasslands  of the world. The grassland  systems  discussed  varied widely  in 
nature,  e.g. intensive  temperate  grassland,  arid/semi-arid  zones,  distinct  wet/dry  
zones, humid  subtropical/tropical  zones, winter  cold temperate  rangelands.  
Separate  sessions  dealt  with  various  aspects  of grassland  production  and utilisa ­
tion, e.g. plant growth  and physiology,  plant breeding,  nutrition,  pests and 
diseases,  nutritive  value of forages,  grassland  management,  utilisation  and 
animal  production  systems.  In the underdeveloped  countries  the main concern  
was to sustain  viable  systems  of grassland  farming  against  a background  of an 
expansion  in population  and climatic  changes. In the developed  countries  where  
intensive  production  is practised  concern  was focussed  on the detrimental  effects  
on the environment  and the high  reliance  of inputs  from outside  the system,  e.g. 
nitrogen  fertiliser,  fossil fuel, imported  feeds and irrigation  to sustain  high 
levels  of production  in an era when many of these countries  are more than 
self-sufficient  in the main products  of grassland,  i.e. dairy produce,  meat and 
fibre.
Animal  production  from  most  grassland  systems  in the world  is low due to the 
extensive  systems  of grazing  adopted  to maintain  the systems  and the high  cost 
or impracticability  of using inputs,  e.g. fertiliser  or supplementary  feed. High  
levels  of production  from  grassland  are mainly associated  with the temperate  or 
continental  grassland  zones  of the developed  world,  e.g. North  West Europe,  
South East Australia,  New Zealand,  East Coast and Mid-West  of U.S.A.  
However,  much  of this production  is dependent  on feeds  other  than grass,  e.g. 
maize,  sorghum,  cereal  grains,  lucerne  and fodder  crops,  often  constituting  more  
than  half  of the animal ’s diet. Ireland  and New  Zealand  are the only  two  countries  
where intensive  animal  production  systems  are largely  based on grassland.  
Intensive  animal  production  mainly  from grassland  is the exception  rather  than 
the rule on a worldwide  scale.

Weather  and grass  growth  in New Zealand
New  Zealand  is located  about  1600  km east  of Southern  Australia  between  34- 
47° south of the equator  and is therefore  much  more favourably  located  than 
Ireland  (51-56°N)  in terms  of solar  radiation  and winter  temperature.  Aspects  of 
weather  and  grass  growth  in New  Zealand  are dealt  with  in detail  in another  paper  
in this proceedings  (E. G. O’Riordan,  Grange)  and only  will be outlined  briefly  
in this paper.  The total sunshine  hours/annum  range  from 1600-2100  hrs in New  
Zealand  (Southlands  - Auckland)  compared  with a range  of 1200-1500  hrs in 
Ireland.  Mean  daily  air temperature  in the North  Island  (Hamilton  and Palmerston  
North)  range  from  8-9°C in winter  (June-August)  to 17-19°C  in summer  (Dec.-  
Feb.)  compared  with  5°C  in winter  (Dec.-Feb.)  and 14°C  in summer  (June-Aug.)  
at Moorepark.  In the Southlands,  i.e. the southern  part  of the South  Island,  which  
most  resembles  Ireland  climatically,  temperatures  in spring  and early summer  
are 1-2°C  higher  than at Moorepark  and consequently  is more favourable  for 
early spring grass growth.  During  late summer,  autumn  and early winter  
temperatures  at Southland  are similar  to Moorepark  but the duration  of sunshine  
is significantly  higher  at Southland  (Fig. 1).
The distribution  of rainfall  in New Zealand  is very much  influenced  by the 
mountainy  terrain  in the centre  of the North  Island  and the Southern  Alps  running  
along  the entire  length  of the South  Island.  Rain-bearing  South  westerly  winds  
blowing  in from  the Tasman  sea provide  a good distribution  of rain, i.e. 1000-  
1200 mm (40-50  ins) in the western  part of the North  Island,  except  in mid­
summer  in inland  areas,  whereas  the eastern  areas  (Hawkes  Bay) receive  5(X)- 
700 mm (20-30  ins) and are very dry in summer.  In the South  Island  rainfall  is 
extremely  variable  between  the west and east coast. The west coast area 
(Westland)  receives  a very  high  rainfall  of2500-4000  mm (100-150  ins) whereas  
the east coast  (Canterbury  and Otago)  which  are sheltered  by the Alps receive  
very  little,  particularly  in inland  areas,  i.e. 400-800  mm (15-30  ins) and is usually  
subject  to a prolonged  summer  drought.  The Southlands  area which is not 
sheltered  by the Alps  receives  a higher  rainfall  of about  1000  mm (40 ins),  similar  
to the South  of Ireland.
Due to the higher  temperature  and solar  radiation  the pattern  of grass  growth  
in New  Zealand  is much more  uniform  than in Ireland.  In the North  Island grass  
growth  in winter  is in the range  of 15-20  kg DM/ha  and rises  gradually  to a peak  
of 50-70  kg DM/ha  by early  summer  (October/November).  Grass  growth  often  
declines  to 20-30  kg DM/ha  due  to midsummer  drought  and rises  again  in autumn  
to 30  kg DM/ha.  This  pattern  is in marked  contrast  to the pattern  of grass  growth  
in Ireland,  e.g. Moorepark  which is characterised  by little  growth  in winter  (5 kg 
DM/ha)  until early March,  followed  by rapid growth  to a peak of 100-120  kg 
DM/ha  in May and a steady  decline  thereafter  to less than 20 kg DM/ha  in 
October/November  (See Figs.  3-4 in E. O’Riordan ’s paper).  In terms of animal  
feed requirements  there  is therefore  far less need  or scope  for grass  conservation  
as hay or silage  in late spring/early  summer  in the North  Island  of New  Zealand  
and less need for winter  feed compared  with Ireland.  In the south  of the South  
Island  the pattern  of grass  growth  at Invermay  (near  Dunedin)  is slower  in spring,  
rising  to a peak  of 60 kg DM/ha  in October,  declines  steadily  to about  20 kg DM/

ha in autumn  (April)  and to less than 10 kg DM/ha  in winter. Thus  grass growth  
in the South  Island  is fairly  similar  to Moorepark  in winter  but is much  earlier  in 
spring and doesn ’t produce  as much growth  in summer  (See Fig. 5 in E. 
O’Riordan ’s paper).  There  is considerable  variation  in the amount  and pattern  of 
grass  growth  in New Zealand  due to location  and the wide  variation  in rainfall  
(Fig. 2). Sustained  levels  of grass  growth  are achieved  from September  to April  
in areas  which  receive  adequate  rainfall  in summer,  e.g. Northlands  and Southlands 
whereas  in the dry areas,  e.g. Canterbury  and Otago  summer  growth  can be poor  
and variable.  Irrigation  is practised  on many dairy farms  in the Canterbury  area 
to ensure  grass  growth.  Conserved  grass  in the form  of hay/silage  or bought-in  
feed is used as much  to supplement  poor  pasture  growth  in mid summer  in the 
drier  areas  as it is for supplementing  winter  pasture.
Milk  production  in New Zealand
Most  of the livestock  in New  Zealand  are located  in the North  Island,  i.e. 90% 
of the dairy  cattle,  80% of the beef  cattle  and 50% of the sheep.  Three-quarters  
of the people  also live there.  Consequently,  from an agricultural  and economic  
perspective  the North  Island  is by far the most  important.  There  are 14,500  dairy  
farms in New Zealand  and three-quarters  (77%)  of those are located  on the 
western  side of the North  Island,  i.e. Northlands,  Waikato  and Tarinaki.  The 
biggest  concentration  of dairy  farmers  (6,300  - 45%)  occur  in the Waikato  area. 
There  are only 1,200  dairy  farms  (9%)  in the South  Island.  These  are located  in 
three  main  areas,  i.e. Westland/Nelson  area  (620),  Canterbury  (280)  and Southland  
(300).  However,  the number  of dairy  farmers  in the South  Island  is growing  as 
more  dairy  farmers  and sharemilkers  move  south  to either  start  up or expand  their  
operation  with larger  herds,  due to the cheaper  price  of land.
The number  of dairy  farms  has declined  from 18,500  in 1974/75  while  cow 
numbers  have increased  from 2.08 to 2.44 million  (Table  1) resulting  in an 
increase  of 43% in the amount  of milk  delivered  for processing.  This  represents  
96%  of all milk  produced.  The average  herd  size is 170 cows,  producing  157 kg 
milk  fat/cow  (=930  gls at 3.6%  fat) at a stocking  rate of 2.4 cows/ha.  Herd size 
and milk fat production  per cow and per hectare  have increased  progressively  
over the last 20 years (Table  2). There is considerable  emphasis  on milk 
recording  and currently  60% of herds involving  66% of all cows are milk-

recorded.  This level has increased  progressively  over the years except  for a 
period  in the late 80’s. Milk  production  per cow in recorded  herds has increased  
from 1970/71  but only to a small  extent  since 1980/81  (Table  3). This may be a 
reflection  of a dilution  effect  by the increasing  numbers  of herds  of average  or 
below  average  production  which  are now being  tested.  Milk  fat composition  is 
quite  high (4.8%)  and has  changed  little  over  the years,  possibly  due to a change  
in breeding  policy  from  Jerseys  to Friesians.  Milk  protein  content  is high  at 3.7%.
Over half of the recorded  cows are Friesian  (53%)  while Jerseys  (21%),  
crossbred  Friesian  x Jersey  cows  (12%)  and other  breeds,  mainly  Ayrshire  and 
Shorthorn  (14%)  represent  the main  breed  types  (Table  4). The highest  concen-

tration  of Jersey  cows  and crossbreds  (48%)  are found  in the Taranaki  area,  while  
the highest  concentration  of Friesians  occur  in the South  Island.  In these  herds  
the average  lactation  length  is similar  for the different  breeds  (226 days).  The 
Friesians  produce  more milk than the Jerseys  but of a lower  fat and protein  
content  while  the crossbred  cows  are intermediate  (Table  5). However,  the three  
breed  types  produce  a similar  yield of milk  fat while  protein  yield  is less for the 
Jerseys.  The fat and protein  composition  of the Friesian  cows is quite high by 
Irish standards  and may be a reflection  of a Jersey  ancestry  coupled  with a 
breeding  policy  to improve  fat content  over the past 30 years. Milk protein  
content  is becoming  of increasing  importance  and in that  regard  the fat to protein  
ratio  of milk  is better  for Friesians  (0.78)  than  for Jerseys  (0.72)  or the crossbred  
cows (0.75).
Milk  processing  for export
The pattern  of milk  production  is even more  seasonal  in New  2^aland  than in 
Ireland.  Virtually  no milk is produced  in the winter  months  of June/July  other  
than for the liquid  trade.  Milk  processing  rises to a peak in October/November,  
i.e. 50 million  kg milk fat/month  and declines  gradually  thereafter.  Milk is 
processed  by 16 co-operatives,  5 large  and 11 small  cooperatives,  9 of which  are 
located  in the South  Island.  Over  7 million  tonnes  of milk  is processed  annually.  
The main dairy products  are butter,  milk powder,  cheese,  casein and food  
ingredients.  About  80% of dairy  products  are exported  exclusively  through  the 
New  Zealand  Dairy Board  which  has a number  of subsidiary  companies  located  
around  the world.  New Zealand  accounts  for only a small  proportion  (1.5%)  of 
total world  milk production.  Nevertheless  its exports  of dairy produce,  which  
represent  only 1.2% of world  milk production,  accounts  for about  25% of the 
world  market  trade, which  is dominated  by the European  Union  and U.S.A.  
International  trade in dairy produce  accounts  for only a small  fraction  (5%) of 
world  milk production.
The New Zealand  Dairy  Board,  which  is farmer  owned,  controls  all exports  
of dairy  produce,  co-ordinates  the type  of product  required  for foreign  markets  
and determines  the direction  of research  and development  into new products  for 
these  markets.  A subsidiary company,  the Livestock  Improvement  Corporation
139
(LIC)  is responsible  for on-farm  developments  such as dairy herd recording,  
breeding,  selection  and  progeny  testing  of bulls,  A.L, special  advisory  service  to 
farmers  via the Consulting  Officers,  processing  of farm  data  and providing  farm 
management  information.
Main  features  of dairy  farming  in New Zealand
There  are a number  of features  which  characterise  the type of dairy  farming  
and system  of milk production  which  has developed  in New Zealand.
(1) Low cost system  of milk  production
The milk  price  paid to farmers  is dependent  solely  on world  market  prices.  
There  are no subsidies  or price  supports  since  the mid-eighties.  Milk  prices  at 
farm level have fluctuated  from NZ$ 4-6/kg  milk fat (= 24-38  IRp/gallon)  in 
recent  years.  The cost of milk  production,  based  on a recent  survey of 200 dairy  
farms,  ranged  from  NZ$2.46  to 4.46/kg  milk  fat, equivalent  to 15-27  IRp/gallon  
from  the top 25% to the bottom  25% of the sample,  based  on profitability.  The 
net profit  margin  or economic  farm  surplus  ranged  from  NZ$  1.70-3.87/kg milk  
fat, equivalent  to 10-23  IR p/gallon  (Deane,  1993).
(2) Grass/clover  based  systems  of milk  production
Most  of the milk is produced  during  the active  grass-growing  season.  Cows  
start to calve 6-8 weeks  ahead  of the point where  grass growth  equals  feed 
demand.  Calving  starts in mid-late  July in the North  Island  and mid-August  in 
the South  Island.  These  cows  graze  on pasture  built  up in the previous  autumn/  
early winter.  Most cows will be calved  by the time grass growth  takes off 
Generally  no concentrates  are fed and conserved  hay, silage  or maize  is fed 
during  periods  of feed deficit,  e.g. during  a summer  drought,  early  winter  or in 
a late spring.  Nitrogen  is applied  (25-50  kg N/ha)  on most  dairy  farms  to boost  
grass  growth  in early spring  and in autumn.  White  clover  is relied  on to supply  
nitrogen  during  most  of the season  but fertiliser  nitrogen  is being  increasingly  
used on intensive  dairy farms  in recent  years.
(3) Large  herd  size - high output  per labour  unit
By Irish  standards  dairy  herds  are quite  large.  A typical  herd  contains  150-200 
cows,  managed  by one family  unit. Only 20% of herds  are less than 100 cows.  
Herd  sizes  are increasing  and a number  of very large  herds  (4(X)-800  cows)  exist.  
There  is a considerable  emphasis  on a high throughput  of cows through  the 
milking  parlour,  e.g. 150 cows  per labour  unit in 1.5 hours.
(4) Compact  calving
To maximise  milk  production  from  grass  considerable  emphasis  is placed  on 
compact  calving  so that the bulk of the herd have calved  down before  grass  
growth  takes  off in spring.  Tailpainting  before  and during  the breeding  season  
is widely  practised  to achieve  a high submission  rate (90%).  A.l. is widely  used 
during  the first 6 weeks  followed  by natural  service  for the next 6 weeks.  Over  
70% of cows  calve  in the first 4 weeks.  Late calving  cows  are induced  to calve  
prematurely  in many  herds to shorten  the calving  season.  These  cows  represent
140
0-20%  of cows  in a herd. Heifers,  late calvers  and cows  not detected  in heat are 
synchronised  to induce  oestrus  in many  herds.
(S ) High  genetic  merit  herds
A high  proportion  of cows  (66%)  are milk-recorded.  Dairy  herd  replacements  
are generally  bred from  the top 50% of cows  on a genetic  breeding  index  basis.  
High genetic  merit bulls are widely  used. These  are selected  from 150 bulls  
submitted  annually  for performance  and progeny  testing.  The top herds may 
breed  all cows  to dairy  bulls  to produce  surplus  heifcrs  for sale.  Herd  replacement  
rates are 20-25%,  resulting  in fairly  rapid  genetic  progress.
(6) Off-wintering  of  dry cows  on drystock  farms
Off-wintering  of dry cows  is practised  by many  intensive  dairy  farmers. This 
practice  permits  higher  stocking  rates  on the home  farm,  reduces  conserved  feed 
requirements,  allows  for a longer  lactation  and the whole  farm is rested  until 
calving.  Heifers  are also contract-reared  on outside  farms.
(7) Capital  investment  priorities
The main  capital  investment  in New Zealand  dairy  farms,  apart  from  cows,  
is in providing  a good milking  facility,  collection  yard, roads and fencing.  
Investment  in other  types  of housing  and machinery  is minimal.  Usually  a hay 
bam is used for storing  hay, rearing  calves,  storing  machinery,  etc. On some  
farms  there may be a feeding  pad for feeding  cows  off the pasture.  Machinery  
usually  consists  of a low HP tractor,  fertiliser  spreader,  silage  feeding  wagon,  
sprayer,  pick-up  truck  and motor  bike. The main emphasis  is to obtain  a good  
return  on investment  and to increase  the net worth  of the farm.
(8) Share  milking  system
A very successful  share  milking system  has operated  for many years  and has 
facilitated  the entry  of new  blood  from  many  sources  into dairy  farming.  Various  
schemes  exist,  e.g. 29-50%  arrangements,  whereby  the share  milker  owns  part 
or all of the herd, the land and facilities  are supplied  by the owner,  and the 
expenses  and profits  are divided  on an agreed  basis.  In due course  sharemilkers  
move  onto bigger  farms  and eventually  purchase  their  own farms.  This system  
builds  up a highly  skilled  and motivated  labour  force,  enables  older  established  
farmers  to phase  out of active  farming  and ensures  mobility  and expansion  in the 
industry.  However,  the high  cost  of land  is limiting  the opportunity  for  sharemilkers  
to purchase  their  own farms.
Year-round  grassland  management  on New Zealand  dairy  farms
Despite  the wide  variation  in soil type  and rainfall  in New  Zealand,  the system  
of grassland  management  on most dairy farms  follow  a general  pattern,  with 
some  local variations.  The main  objective  on all farms  is to convert  grazed  grass  
into milk with the minimum  of supplementary  feeding  and to winter  the cows  
during  the dry period  as cheaply  as possible.  During  the dry period  (May/July)  
on farms  where  cows  are wintered  on the home  farm,  cows  are grazed  restrictedly  
on winter pasture  and supplemented  with hay/silage  to maintain  them in 
moderate  condition  until  calving.  Pasture  cover  is built  up in the autumn  as cows  
are dried  off or culled  and restricted  grazing  begins, following  an application  of
141

on a New  Zealand  dairy  farm.
142
nitrogen  (30-50  kg/ha)  to provide  an average  cover  of 2000  kg DM/ha  over  the 
whole  farm  at the start of calving  (Fig. 3). The cows  are strip grazed  using  back  
fences  in a long  rotation  over  the winter  (90-120  days).  Supplementary  feed,  e.g. 
hay/silage  or other  crops,  tend  to be fed in early winter  until the required  pasture  
cover is reached,  usually  on the grazed  area, but in some cases in specially  
constructed  feeding  areas. Wintering  pads  are provided  on some  farms  in wetter  
areas  or heavy  soils to which  cows  are moved  after grazing.  When  cows  calve  
down  in spring  (July/August  in North  Island)  the pasture  allocation  is increased  
to provide  16 kg DWcow/day  to the milking  cows  and the pasture  cover  on the 
farm  is gradually  reduced  to about  1500  kg DMlha  by September.  Hay or silage  
supplements  are fed during  this period  if grass  cover  is not adequate  to sustain  
milk  production.  Nitrogen  is applied  (25-50  kg N/ha)  to boost  grass  growth  in the 
grazed  area. From  mid-September  onwards  grass  growth  is usually  adequate  in 
the North  Island  to meet  the level of feed required  at peak lactation.  Cows  are 
rotationally  grazed  (16-24  day rotation)  during  October/November  to achieve  
maximum  milk production  from grass and to ensure  a high intake  during  the 
breeding  season.  Pasture  cover  gradually  increases  to 1800-20(X)  kg DM/ha.  
Surplus  grass (usually  10-30%  of the farm) is conserved  as hay or silage  but 
preference  is given  to the cows  and on some  farms  no grass is conserved.  Maize  
is grown  on some farms  as a green feed during  summer  drought.  In summer  
(December/February)  grass growth  is often poor (10-30  kg DM/ha)  due to a 
moisture  deficit  and supplementary  feeds,  e.g. hay,  silage  or green  maize  are fed 
to maintain  milk  production.  Deferred  pasture  accumulated  from spring  is strip 
grazed  in certain  areas,  e.g. Tarinaki.  Irrigation  is practised  in dry areas,  e.g. 
Canterbury.
In autumn  (March/April)  there is usually  a flush of growth  as the moisture  
deficit  is reduced.  However,  the emphasis  is switched  from maintaining  milk  
production  to building  up grass  reserves  for the winter,  even  at the expense  of the 
current  yield. Grazing  is restricted  to extend  the rotation  (30-50  days). Feed  
demand  is reduced  by selling  off cull cows,  drying  off low yielding  cows  and 
heifers  and grass growth  is boosted  by applying  nitrogen fertiliser  (25-50  kg N/ 
ha). Cow  body  condition  is improved  to achieve  a moderate  score  of 5 (= 2.5 Irish 
score). In early winter  (May)  the remaining  cows  are dried  off and the pasture  
is rationed  and grazed  tightly  down to less than  KXX)  kg DM/ha  over  the winter  
months  in a long rotation.  On many dairy farms  the cows are off-wintered  on 
other  farms,  e.g. sheep  farms  for all or part  of the winter.  Replacement  heifers  are 
usually  reared  off the dairy  farm,  i.e. contract  reared  by other  farmers  or on an 
out-farm,  or “run off ’ area and join the herd prior to calving.  Monitoring  of 
pasture  cover  going  into the winter  is an important  aspect  of feed  budgeting  since  
conserved  feed,  e.g. hay/silage  usually represents  only a small  part (30-50%)  of 
the total winter  feed requirements.  In a recent  survey  about  half of the dairy  
farmers  who responded  aimed  for a target  pasture  cover  at calving  either  by 
regular  assessment  or extended  rotation.  Assessment  was done mainly  by eye 
appraisal  (90%), while relatively  few used plate meters (9%), or pasture  
probes  (3%). Only 22% of farmers  formally  prepared  a feed budget  (Parker  
et al., 1993).
143
Dairy  farming  in the Southlands
The Southlands,  i.e. the southern  part of the South Island,  is climatically  
closest  to Ireland.  There,  the cows  calve  later,  e.g. August/September,  due to the 
longer  winter  and later growth  in spring  compared  with the North  Island.  The 
requirements  for winter  feed  are also  much  greater.  Dairy  herds  can be classified  
into two categories,  i.e. “self-contained ” or “milking  platforms ” (Ms. Gail 
Wylie,  LIC  Consulting  Officer,  personal  communication).  On the .self-contained 
farms  all winter  feed  is made  on the farm  and replacement  stock  are reared  on the 
farm. The stocking  rates are usually  1.6-2.4  cows/ha  producing  270-440  kg 
milkfat/ha.  Winter  feed requirements  are 9-10 kg DM/cow,  since cows are 
generally  larger  (mainly  Friesian)  and weather  is colder  than in the North  Island.  
Conserved  feed requirements  are in the region  of 1000-1100 kg DM/cow.  This 
includes  an average  of 600 kg DM/cow  as hay or silage  and 200 kg DM/cow  as 
crops,  e.g. kale or swedes  for feeding  during  the winter. About  250 kg DM/cow  
of hay or silage  is fed to milking  cows  in autumn  and spring.  About  10-20%  of 
winter  feed  requirements  is obtained  from  grazed  pasture  when  soil conditions  
allow. Thus total conserved  feed requirements  for self-contained  herds in 
Southland  are equivalent  to 5-6 tonnes  silage  (20% DM), fairly similar  to the 
requirements  in the South  of Ireland.  About  half  of the dairy  farms  in Southland  
are described  as milking  platforms,  i.e. milking  cows  only  are carried  on the farm  
during  the grazing  season.  Replacement  stock  are reared  off the farm  until prior  
to calving.  Cows  are off-wintered  either  on another  farm,  e.g. a sheep  farm  or 
on a “run off ’ area which  is separate  from  the dairy  farm where  they are fed hay/ 
silage  plus brassica  crops  or they are wintered  on a stand-off  feed pad and fed 
mainly  on purchased  hay or silage.
On these farms the stocking  rates are higher,  e.g. 2.4-3.5  cows/ha  and 
consequently  milk production  is higher  (400-700  kg milkfat/ha)  and they are 
generally  more  profitable.  Conserved  feed  made  on the dairy farm  is of the order  
of200-300  kg DM/cow  to supplement  pasture  in autumn  and to provide  for a wet 
spring.  The pasture  on these  farms  is rested  over  the winter  and is grazed  only  by 
in-calf  heifers  which  are brought  home  for a month  before  calving  starts.
Limitations  and weaknesses  in New  Zealand  dairying
New Zealand  dairy farming  is often held up as a m^el  which  Irish dairy  
farmers  should  follow.  The system  of dairy  farming  in New  Zealand  has evolved  
over the years  to suit the climate,  pattern  of grass  growth,  scale of farming  and 
distance  from its main  market  outlets.  While  there  are some  similarities  there  are 
also differences  between  the two countries  which  must be taken into account.  
There  are many  progressive  and highly  motivated  dairy  farmers  in New  Zealand.  
However,  the dairy  industry there  has its own limitations  and weaknesses  which  
must  be recognised.
(/) Under-feeding  of  dairy  cows  and heifers
By Irish or European  standards.  New Zealand  dairy  cows  are quite  light and 
generally  are in poorer  condition.  Jersey  cows average  about 350 kg while  
Friesians  average  about  450 kg, except  in Southland  (500  kg). Cows  are calved  
down  in moderate  condition  (BCS  = 2.5) and are stocked  heavily  on intensive
144
dairy farms  with little supplementation.  Cows  with a high breeding  index  are 
seldom  given  an opportunity  to realise  their  potential.  Heifers  are generally  light  
at mating  (280 kg) and calve  down  at light weights  (380-400  kg). They  have  to 
compete  with the other  cows on intensively  stocked  farms  and consequently  
about  25% of heifers  are culled  annually.  There  is a growing  awareness  of the 
need to feed cows  better.
(2) Extremely  seasonal  pattern  of milk  production
The concentrated  pattern  of calving  and limited  supplementary  feeding  
during  early  or late lactation  results  in a very  high  seasonal  milk  production  peak  
in Oct./Nov.  This results  in a high investment  in processing  capacity  which  is 
severely  stretched  during  the peak period  and is poorly  utilized  during  the 
remainder  of the season. The current  expansion  in milk  production  will  put even  
more pressure  on the existing  processing  capacity.  The short lactation  length  
(220-230  days)  of most  dairy  herds  contributes  to this problem.  Better  feeding,  
particularly  in mid/late  lactation  would  help to round  out the seasonal  pattern  of 
milk  production.  Winter  milk  production  is never  likely  to be economical  in New  
2^aland  apart  from  domestic  liquid  milk requirements.
(3) Variation  in pasture  production  and quality
Apart  from seasonal  and regional  variation  in grass growth,  many of the 
swards  are very open,  presumably  due to repeated  hard grazing  in winter  and 
during  summer  drought.  Ingress  of weeds  are a problem,  i.e. dandelion,  docks  
and  ragworth  in the South  Island.  In dry areas  perennial  ryegrass  performs  poorly  
and other  more  drought-resistant  species  are being  introduced,  e.g. tall fescue,  
cocksfoot,  paspalum.  The white  clover  content  of many  swards  is often  less than 
expected  (0-20%)  and in many  cases  makes  only a small  contribution  to sward  
fertility  and productivity.  Many  dairy farmers  are increasingly  using fertiliser  
nitrogen  throughout  the season  to overcome  their  dependence  on clover.  The use 
of nitrogen  fertilizers  has increased  four-fold  in recent  years.
(4) Pasture  pests  and animal  diseases
The roots  of grass  and clover  are susceptible  to attack  from  “grass  grub ” in the 
North  Island,  resulting  in reduced  productivity.  The base of grass plants are 
subject  to attack  by Argentinian  stem  weevil. This  problem  can be overcome  by 
sowing  ryegrass  varieties  containing  an endophyte  (a fungus)  which  makes  the 
plant  resistant  to attack  from stem weevil.  However  the endophyte  contains  a 
toxin which  gives  rise to a neuromuscular  disorder  in cattle  and sheep  known  as 
grass  staggers.  Cows  are also susceptible  to other  disorders,  e.g. grass  tetany  in 
spring,  bloat  on high clover  swards  and facial  eczema.  Preventative  measures  
usually  involve  continuous  drenching  in the milking  parlour  during  the periods  
of susceptibility.
(5) A conservative  approach  to dairying
Most  dairy  farmers  have  become  accustomed  to the “all grass ” system  of milk 
production  which  has evolved  over  the years  with its emphasis  on low cost milk  
production.  They are reluctant  to make changes  in that system  and there is a 
strong  resistance  to feeding  supplements  especially  concentrates,  which  might  
increase  feed costs.  However,  this attitude  is beginning  to change  and given  a
145
period  of stable  or rising  world  market  prices  for dairy  products,  better  feeding  
regimes,  including  more  supplementation,  are likely  to be adopted.
(6) High  priced  land
In the intensive  dairying  regions  of the North  Island  farmland  suitable  for 
dairying  is becoming  very  expensive.  Existing  dairy  farms  are sold on the basis  
of current  levels  of production,  i.e. NZ$30-40/kg  milkfat  which  is equivalent  to 
IR£ 1,500-2,000/acre,  due to competition  between  dairy farmers,  other land 
users, e.g. stud farmers,  horticulturists  and “hobby  farmers ” near towns and 
cities.  This  results  in a high  level  of  borrowings  for new  entrants,  e.g. sharemilkers  
and is beginning  to limit  their  numbers. As a result  there  is a movement  by such 
people  to the South  Island  and other  less traditional  areas  to start up dairying  in 
areas  where  land is cheaper  and larger  farms  can be established.
Milk  production  on New  Zealand  dairy  farms
Recent  trials  carried  out at one of the Dairy  Research  Corporation  farms  at 
Ruakura  have  shown  that high levels  of milk  production,  e.g. 700 kg milkfat/ha  
and 500 kg milk  protein/ha  can be achieved  when  cows  are intensively  stocked  
at levels  where  milk  production  per  cow  was reduced  when  no supplements  were  
fed during  lactation.  The  maximum  production  of milk  solids  and income/ha  was 
achieved  at stocking  rates of 3.0 Friesian  cows/ha  and 3.8-4.0  Jersey  cows/ha.  
Higher  levels  of milkfat  production/ha  were  achieved  with  Jersey  cows  than  with 
Friesian  cows as milk  production/cow  was depressed  to a lesser  extent  at high 
stocking  rates with Jersey  cows  compared  with Friesians.
A recent  survey  of milk  production  costs  and profitability  from  a representa ­
tive sample  of 198 dairy  farmers  throughout  New Zealand  has been carried  out 
in the 1991/92  season  by the Livestock  Improvement  Corporation  (Deane,  
1993).  The  farms  involved  represented  a wide  range  in farming  conditions,  levels  
of  production  and farming  ability.  There  was a strong  linear  relationship  between  
stocking  rate and milk  fat production/ha  (Fig.  4). The stocking  rate ranged  from  
1-4 cows/ha  (2.5-0.6  acs/cow)  and milk  fat production  ranged  from  <100  to 750

butterfat.  There  was no indication,  over the wide range  of farming  conditions,  
cow potential  and managerial  ability  involved,  that milk yield per cow was 
depressed  as stocking  rate was reduced  (Fig.  5). It may  be surprising  to many  that 
such a wide range in stocking  rate and production  exists in New Zealand  
dairying.  Farm receipts  (income)  per hectare  were highly  related  to milk fat 
production/ha  but farm  expenses  and overhead  costs  also increased  (Fig.  6). The 
economic  farm surplus  or net profit  margin/ha  (i.e. money  available  to service  
debt, personal  drawings,  tax and reinvestment)  also increased  with increased  
milkfat  production/ha  but the relationship  was weak,  indicating  that the same  
level of income  was achieved  at vastly  different  levels  of production  (Fig. 7).

potential  in terms  of milk  production  the top 10% of milk  producers  produce  25- 
35% more  milkfat  + protein/ha  than the district  average  while  they produce  61- 
86% more  than  the bottom  25% (Table  7). These  differences  are likely to be due 
to a number  of factors,  e.g. higher  stocking  rates,  differences  in breed  type or 
genetic  potential  of the cows,  whether  replacements  are reared  on or off  the farm,  
off-wintering  of dry cows,  and differences  in managerial  ability,  stockmanship  
and ambitions  of the individual  farmers.
The main factors  determining  a high output  of milk solids/ha  have been  
established  from  research  at Ruakura  and other  centres.  These  are (1) stocking  
rate, (2) calving  date and spread,  (3) cow quality  and (4) drying-off  decisions  in 
relation  to feed supply.  Other  factors,  including  the management  of feed supply  
are of minor  importance  compared  with those  listed  above  (Bryant,  1993).
Agricultural  research  in New  Zealand
Government  funding  for “public  good ” research  is channelled  through  an 
agency  called  the Foundation  for Research,  Science  and Technology  (FRST).  
The funds are administered  through  ten Crown  Research  Institutes  which  are 
responsible  for the various  research  organisations  involved  in agriculture,  
industry,  environment,  etc. The research  organisations  most relevant  to grass ­
land, animal  production  and dairying  are as follows:
Ag Research  - NZ Pastoral  Agricultural  Research  Institute.
It is responsible  for all aspects  of grassland  and animal  production  research,  
other  than dairying.  It is divided  into five main divisions  located  at different  
centres  in New Zealand.
rn Riiakiira  Research  Centre  (Hamilton)  - animal  production,
physiology,  nutrition

Each of these centres  have a large team of research  personnel,  extensive  
laboratory  and farm facilities  at the main campus.  There  are also a number  of 
research  stations  attached  to these  centres,  located  in strategic  soil type/climatic  
areas  with  a team  of research  and technical  staff  at each  station  to develop  animal  
production  systems  suited  to those  areas.
Dairy  Research  Corporation  (DRC)
This  organisation  is a joint  venture  between  the New  Zealand  Dairy  Board  and 
the Ministry  of Agriculture.  It is responsible  for all dairy farm production  
research.  The staff and facilities  include  those formerly  involved  in dairv  
production  research  at the Ruakura  Research  Centre,  Tarinaki  Agricultural  
Research  Station  and the Lactation  Physiology  Dept, based  at Ruakura  Research  
Centre.  Its mam goal is to promote  innovation  in New Zealand  dairy farm 
production  and to enhance  its competitiveness  by increased  production  from 
existing  systems  (1750  kg milk  solids/ha)  through  improved  pasture  production  
better  cow  nutrition  by strategic  supplementation,  control  of metabolic  diseases ’

Dairy  Research  Institute  (DRI)
This  institute,  which  is based  at Palmerston  North,  is responsible  for research  
into milk processing  and product  development.  It is mainly  funded  by the New  
Zealand  Dairy Board (90%) and the research  programme  is driven by the 
requirements  of the export  market.  It is involved  in the development  of a wide  
range  of products  and processes,  e.g. casein  products,  milk powders,  milk fat 
products,  cheese  technology,  food  ingredients,  starters,  whey  products,  flavours  
protein  chemistry,  etc. ’
Massey  University  and Lincoln  University
These  two universities  provide  degree  and diploma  courses  in agriculture,  
ost-graduate  degree  courses  (M.Sc.)  are also provided  at Massey.  Massey  
University  has extensive  land and animal  facilities  for educational  and research  
purposes  m dairying,  beef, sheep  and deer production.  Lincoln  University  has 
more limited  facilities.  Prospective  young  farmers  can undertake  certificate  
courses  in farimng  and farm business  management  at Community  Colleges  and 
Polytechnical  Colleges  throughout  the country.

Advisory  Service
The  M  AF advisory  service,  which  was formerly  available  free  to farmers,  has 
been considerably  reduced  from  320 to 125 staff  currently  and is now available  
on a fee paying  basis  only.  Management  and financial  advice  is also provided  by 
commercial  consultants  (90),  company  advisers  and the Consulting  Officers  (33) 
of the Livestock  Improvement  Corporation.  These  have  to provide  a service  to 
56,000  livestock  and crop farmers  and 9,000  horticulturists.
Dairy  Research  and Development  Funding
Funding  for dairy production  and processing  research  and development  in 
New Zealand  is largely  paid for by the dairy industry  and amounts  to NZ$40  
million,  equivalent  to 1^14  million  per annum.  This represents  an average  
contribution  of £1,000  per farmer  or £6 per cow, or 0.8p per gallon  of milk  
compared  with  the Dairy  Research  Levy  in Ireland  of O.lp per gallon.  The total 
investment  in agricultural  research  in New Zealand,  despite  recent  cutbacks,  
would  be at least 3-4 times  greater  than in Ireland.  This gives  New Zealand  a 
considerable  advantage  to expand  their  production,  develop  new products  and 
gain access  to world  markets  at the expense  of Irish and other  producers.
Conclusions
There are some similarities  between  the Irish and New Zealand  dairy  
industries  in that both  are largely  based  on grassland,  are seasonal  producers  and 
are largely  export  oriented.  However,  the North  Island  of New Zealand,  where  
most of the dairy farming  occurs,  does have a climatic  advantage  in terms  of 
temperature  and sunshine.  Grass  production  is more  evenly  distributed  (except  
in mid-summer)  and grass  growth  in winter  is far higher  in New  Zealand,  thereby  
considerably  reducing  the need for expensive  winter  feed. The ability  to out- 
winter  cows  results  in a considerable  saving  in terms  of housing,  slurry  storage  
and disposal.  This  saving  in winter  feed and housing  coupled  with  a much larger  
herd  size  enables  New  Zealand  dairy  farmers  to produce  milk  at an extremely  low 
price  and survive  at low world  market  prices.  In the Southlands,  the climate  is 
more  similar  to that along  the south  coast  of Ireland,  but temperatures  in early  
spring  are higher  in Southland,  resulting  in earlier  grass  growth.  The amount  of 
sunshine  is also higher  in Southland  throughout  the winter  and this helps  to dry 
out the soil as well as favouring  grass growth.  Self-contained  dairy farms in 
Southland  produce  a lot of winter  feed, approximately  similar  to dairy  farms  in 
the South  of Ireland.
While  there  are these  differences  in climate,  pattern  of grass  growth  and the 
scale of operation  between  Irish and New Zealand  dairy farming,  there are, 
nevertheless,  certain  aspects  of New Zealand  dairy farming  which  are quite  
relevant  to Irish dairy farmers.  These  are (1) the ability  to match  the overall  
stocking  rate to the grass production  potential  of the farm so as to maximise  
production  per hectare,  where  quota  constraints  do not operate,  (2) calving  the 
cows  in a compact  manner  about  a month  ahead  of the point  where grass growth  
is expected  to take off (i.e. February/March),  (3) manage  the pasture  so as to 
maximise  milk production  through  the main growing  season,  (4) extend  the
151
grazing  season,  where  the stocking  rate and soil type  allows,  by building  up grass  
cover  in autumn  for grazing  in early winter  (November/December)  and early  
spring  (February/March),  (5) milk  recording  of more  herds,  to identify  the better  
cows  for breeding  and use of high  RBI  bulls  to improve  the genetic  quality  of the 
herd,  (6) manage  the farming  operation  as a business  so as to maximise  the farm 
net income  and increase  the net worth  of the farm,  (7) greater  mobility  into and 
out of dairy  farming,  which  is a regular  feature  of New  Zealand  dairying,  and the 
inflow  of young  blood  via farm apprenticeship  or sharemilking  arrangements.  
The right  to build  up entitlement  to a reasonable  sized quota  and transfer  it onto 
their own farm ultimately  would  be essential  if such a system  is to operate  
successfully.

Milk  Production  Systems  - Management  
and Economic  Considerations
S. CROSSE  and P. DILLON
Teagasc,  Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
The long-term  viability  of the dairy industry  is dependent  both  upon  the milk  
producer  receiving  sufficient  return  for his inputs  of labour,  capital,  and the 
consumer  being  offered  a quality  product  at a price which  is realistic  enough  
to ensure  an adequate  demand.  For the dairy farmer  this implies  making  Ihe 
maximum  use of grass  in the system  of milk  production  since  it is a cheap  source  
of high quality  feed.
This paper  will deal with 4 main topics  which  have a large  influence  on the 
viability of the dairy  farm.  These  include  (i) quota  size and quota  management,  
(ii) milk price,  (iii) calving  date, (iv) stocking  rate, and (v) milk yield  per cow.
In order  to discuss  these topics,  a model  farm will be used as illustrated  in 
Table 1.
Table 1 
Farm  Profile
Farm size (ac) 80
Farm milk quota (gallons) 50,000
Milk yield/cow (gallons) 1,100
Farm liabilities (£) 40,000
Farm/Family  drawings 20,000
The farm enterprises  will include  dairying  and beef. The discussion  will 
mainly  focus  on the opportunity  to increase  the farm margin.  In order  to pursue  
any of these options  at farm level, a more detailed  analysis  is required.
(1) Milk  quota  and quota  management
Since  the introduction  of milk  quotas,  the size of quota  on the farm  is a major  
determinant  of farm income.  The data in Table  2 show  the effect  of quota  size 
on farm gross margin.
Table  2
Effect  of quota  size on farm gross margin
Quota  Size Farm Gross
Gallons Margin
40,000 37,547
50,000 44,934
60,000 52,321
70,000 59,707
If the farm  quota  could  be increased  from  50,000  to 70,000  gallons,  this would  
result in an increase  in farm gross margin  from £44,934  to £59,707.  This 
represents  an increase  of £14,773  or £7,400  for an additional  10,000  of quota.  
Quota  management  is also important.  Many  dairy  farmers  have  too many  cows  
for the quota  on the farm. In the early years after the introduction  of quotas,  
it was  possible  to avail  of “flexi ” milk.  But in recent  years,  this policy  has proved  
to result  in high risk farming.  Many  farmers  now have to dry off cows early  
and reduce  feeding  especially  in the early spring  period.  This is resulting  in 
reduced  farm  profit.  It should  also be recognised  that the quota  size per holding  
in Ireland  is relatively  small as can be seen from Table  3.

The additional  gross margin  return  per gallon  of milk quota  as influenced  
by milk yield per cow and milk price is shown  in Table  4.

It is evident  from these data that the value of an additional  gallon  of milk 
quota  is very much  dependent  on the yield level of the herd and the prevailing  
milk price at the time. This must be considered  if additional  milk quota  is to 
be leased.
Milk price
The relatively  high income  from dairying  in Ireland  in recent  years is due 
to a large extent  to a high milk price. The effect  of milk price on farm gross  
margin  and net margin  is shown  in Table  5.

80 39,841 4,841
90 44,934 9,934
100 50,075 15,075
The farm gross margin  for a milk price of 70, 80, 90 and 100 p/gallon  is 
£34,698,  £39,841,  £44,934  and £50,075  respectively.  When  fixed costs and 
living expenses  are considered  the net margin  is -£302,  £4,841,  £9,934  and 
£15,075  respectively.  If milk price  drops  to 70p/gallon  then there will be very 
little surplus  cash available.  This emphasises  the extent  to which  farms with 
a small milk quota  are dependent  on milk price.
Calving  date
The effect of calving  month  on the cost of milk production/cow  and on 
margin/cow  is shown  in Table  6.

Calving  date has a large influence  on the seasonality  of milk supply,  on the 
cost of milk production  and on farm profit. The spread  of calvings  is also 
important.  If no milk bonus payments  are available  then the calving  date 
(compact  calving  essential)  should  be concentrated  just prior to the start of the 
grazing  season  (early  March  in the south  of Ireland).  Calving  in January  will 
add £44/cow  to costs  and calving  in October  will add  £ 114/cow  to costs.  January  
calving  will reduce  margin  by £23/cow  while October  calving  will reduce
margin  per cow by £57 (if no milk bonus  is paid).  Systems  of milk  production  
based  on March  calving  result  in a highly  seasonal  milk supply  pattern.  This 
is not suitable  for the full range  of product  mix in Ireland.  Some  autumn  calving  
is consequently  necessary  and winter  milk  bonuses  are paid  to encourage  farmers  
to produce  out of season  milk. Winter  milk schemes  can best be exploited  by 
concentrating  the majority  of calving  to the start  of the grazing  season  and then  
calving  the remainder  of the herd in late September/early  October.  Generally,  
a ratio of 60% spring  and 40% autumn  calving  results  in profitable  systems  of 
milk  production  where  up to 35%  of total  milk  supply  is required  by the processor  
in the period  from October  to February.  All the advantages  of the extra  bonus  
can easily  be eroded  by a scattered  calving  pattern.  The milk processor  might  
best be advised  to encourage  100% autumn  calving  using selected  farms  and 
then combine  the milk from the total pool of milk in the factory.
Stocking  rate
Traditionally  milk  production  systems  in Ireland  were  driven  by high  output  
per acre even if this resulted  in a depression  in milk yield per cow. Since  the 
advent  of milk  quota,  this situation  has changed.  The  farm  quota  is now  generally  
more  limiting  than  the land  area.  There  is now  no need  to have  very  high  stocking  
rates for the dairy  cows  especially  since  the return  from allocating  excess  land 
to other enterprises  is low. Performance  per cow has now assumed  more  
importance  than performance  per acre.
The effect  of calving  month  and stocking  rate on cost of milk production/  
cow and on margin/cow  is shown  in Table  7.

A reduction  in stocking  rate from 0.85 ac/cow  to 0.95 ac/cow  for March  
calving  cows  reduces  costs  by £7/cow  but it increases  the margin/cow  by £49. 
This is due mainly  to extra  performance  by allocating  more  grass to the cow. 
It is possible  now to have a plentiful  supply  of high quality  grass available  to 
the dairy  cow and this can  be easily  achieved  by reducing  the stocking  rate. The 
benefits  are mainly  seen  from mid season  onwards.  Lowering  the stocking  rates,  
however,  presents  many  challenges  to the farmer  in order  to maintain  quality  
grass to the cow at all times.
Milk yield/cow
High genetic  merit cows are very important  for profitable  dairying.  The 
continued  improvement  of the genetic  merit  of the herd is achieved  by breeding
the cows  to the best sires available.  It is important  that the genetic  potential  of 
these  animals  is fully  exploited  by having  them  well  fed and with  a major  portion  
of the feed coming  from grazed  grass. There are indications  now that dairy  
farmers  are neglecting  milk  yield  per cow  with  a consequent  loss in farm  income.  
This is due in part to poor quota  management  (too many cows for the quota  
available)  and  an over-emphasis  on reducing  the variable  cost  of milk  production  
which  can result  in a loss in milk receipts.  When  considering  milk yield per 
cow, cognizance  must be taken  of its effect  on the numbers  of cows  to fill the 
quota,  the capital  investment  in livestock  and buildings,  the opportunity  cost 
of this capital  as well as the land, labour,  etc.
The effect  of milk yield/cow  on farm profitability  is shown  in Table  8. The 
milk yield per cow is allowed  to vary without  a change  in variable  costs per 
cow (better  management).

Farm  income  can be increased  by up to £3,000  or 6 p/gallon  of quota  by having  
a 1,200 gallon  herd vs a 1000 gallon  herd. The variable  costs for the dairy  
enterprise  can be reduced  by up to 5 p/gallon  by having  a 12(X) gallon  herd vs
a 1000  gallon  herd. The exploitation  of the potential  of a herd should  also result  
in the following  additional  benefits:  1) Sale of surplus  cows  releases  capital,  2) 
Lower  labour  requirement,  3) Less demand  for additional  dairy facilities,  4) 
Opportunity  to use the released  land  to reduce  further  the cost  of milk  production.
It is not clear if it will be profitable  for Irish dairy farmers  to continue  to 
breed  their  cows  to the best sires available  in the world.  Our low cost systems  
of milk production  based  on grass and silage  may not be adequate  for these  
animals.  They may have the effect  of pulling  in high cost systems.  This is an 
issue which  needs  to be researched.
Summary
Traditionally  milk  production  systems  in Ireland  (pre-quota)  were  driven  by 
the achievement  of high  output/acre  and generally  resulted  in a highly  seasonal  
milk  supply  pattern.  With  the introduction  of milk  quotas,  the decision-making  
process  to devise  the optimum  system  on dairy farms  became  more  complex.  
There  is less emphasis  now  on very  high  stocking  rates.  To achieve  the maximum  
return  from  the milk  quota  available  on the farm,  the dairy  farmer  has to consider  
the milk  supply  and milk  quality  requirement  of the food  industry. High  margins  
can be achieved  by maximising  the receipts  from  the farm  as well as  controlling  
costs.  Milk  yield/cow,  milk price and a high price  for calves  and cull cows  are 
of critical  importance.  Costs (variable,  fixed and depreciation  costs)  are also 
very important  and need to be continuously  reviewed.  Care must be taken in 
the drive to reduce  costs so as not to reduce  the receipts/cow  on the farm too 
much.  The goal should  be to maximise  net margin  from the farm. Losses  due 
to reproductive  wastage,  animal  health,  etc. need to be controlled.  The milk 
production  system  will need to be sustainable  economically  and in terms  of its 
impact  on the environment  and on the quality  of life for the farm family.
Achieving  High  Performance  from  Dairy  
Cows on Grazed  Pastures

Before  the introduction  of milk quotas  in Ireland,  profitable  dairying  was 
driven  by the objective  of increasing  farm sales of milk. This was mainly  
dependent  on using  high stocking  rates (3.0 to 3.5 cows/ha),  medium  levels  of 
N (300 kg/ha),  2 cuts of silage,  early and compact  calving  6-8 weeks  prior  to 
turn-out  to spring  pasture  and high genetic  merit  cows.  The use of such high 
stocking  rates depressed  cow milk  yields  by 10-20%  but maximised  the yields  
of milk/ha  by around  8-10%.  The requirement  for winter  feed as silage  placed  
a limit  on stocking  rate because  as stocking  rates increased  it became  increas ­
ingly difficult  to conserve  sufficient  winter  feed from the available  hectares.  
Approximately  6-7 tonnes  of silage  per cow were required  on dry land farms.  
An extra 2 tonnes  of silage  was required  on wet land farms  and therefore  the 
optimum  stocking  was some  20% lower.  The adequate  feeding  of the cow on 
grazed  grass  is now of central  importance.  The constraints  to intake  at pasture,  
feed requirement  of the cow,  feed  supply  at pasture,  supplementary  feeding  and 
the digestion  of grass  as well  as nutrient  supply  to the small  intestine  from  grass  
are major  issues  with regard  to potential  milk production  from pasture.  The 
research  programme  of the Dairy  Husbandry  Department  since  the quotas  has 
reflected  this change  of objectives.
Potential  production  from grazed  pasture
Many  factors  are well known to affect  production  of grazing  cows. The most  
important  sward  factors  are the quantity  and  quality  of grass  available  for grazing  
and the daily herbage  allowance  (stocking  rate) as well as the provision  of 
supplementary  feeds. In addition,  cow factors  play a major  role. Cows have  
different  milk production  potentials  (based  on genetic  indices).  Individual  cow 
intake  studies  at Moorepark  have shown  that for each extra 1 kg of FC milk  
production  at pasture,  the cow will consume  0.4 kg of extra  pasture  dry matter  
under  ad libitum  feeding  conditions  (Stakelum  and Connolly,  1987).  Genetic  
selection  for milk yield will produce  cows of high intake  potential  as well as 
higher  efficiency.  To fully exploit  the extra  feed demand,  these  cows need to 
be better  fed at pasture.
Farmers  often ask “What yields of milk will pastures  support  if I do 
everything  right and control  quality  and quantity  of herbage  throughout  the 
lactation? ” Experiments  at Moorepark  in 1985  with  early  February  calving  cows  
established,  when  daily  herbage  allowance  was twice  the daily  intake level  with 
high digestibility  pastures  (regrowths  of 4 weeks  after cutting)  throughout  the 
lactation,  that yields  of 204 and 183 kg of milk  fat and protein respectively  could  
be achieved  per cow (Stakelum,  1991). Higher  intakes  caused  no further  
increases  in milk  fat or protein  yields  but resulted  in increases  in cow  li veweights.

The results  indicated  that the herds  were  being  fed on pasture  to produce  milk 
at or near their potential.  Higher  genetic  material  would  be needed  to further  
increase  milk  production  from  pasture  under  these  conditions.  It is not intended  
to deal with  this subject  here  but  to describe  the recent  advances  in our  knowledge  
of pasture  feeding  of cows under  rotational  grazing.
Grass  supply  and cow demand  during  grazing
The traditional  system  of seasonal  milk  production  from  pasture  was based  
on high  stocking  rates  and compact  calving  6-8 weeks  prior  to turn-out  to spring  
pasture.  The  concentrate  input  in this system  was around  0.5 tonnes.  This  system  
was capable  of producing  70% of the milk from grazed  pasture  with the 
remaining  coming  from  silage  and concentrate.  The figure  of 70% refers  to the  
intake  of a lactating  cow from  calving  to drying  off. In this system  (see Figure  
1) grass supply  is not sufficient  to meet the feed requirement  of the cow in 
January  to March  or from October  through  to December.  There is a small  
deficiency  of grass  in April and  September.  Some  concentrate  feeding  at pasture  
was necessitated  in early April to sustain  yields  immediately  after turn-out  to 
pasture.  This  feeding  usually  ceased  by mid-April.  The first  grazing  cycle  lasted  
up to 10 April (normal  grass  growth  pattern)  and at this time  current  grass  growth  
rate was sufficient  to feed the cows when 45% of the farm was closed  up for 
silage.  The May/June  period  usually  produced  an oversupply  of grass  in those  
months  and this factor  was responsible  for poor on pasture  performance  later 
in the season.
The experiments  run at Curtins  farm since 1990 (Dillon  and Crosse,  1992)  
have examined  two major  factors  controlling  this supply  and demand  relation ­
ship, namely,  calving  date and stocking  rate. Altering  the calving  date changes  
the seasonal  demand  pattern  for grass  and reducing  stocking  rate increases  the

feed supply from grazed  grass. Figure  2 outlines  the supply and demand  
relationship  for a situation  where  cows  calve  6-8 weeks  later (ie. much  closer  
to the commencement  of grass  growth  at a 10% reduced  stocking  rate). It is now 
apparent  that the April and September  deficits  are eliminated  and the March  
and October  deficits  are reduced  substantially.  The feed  demand  in the January-  
April period  is reduced  because  there are less cows  in milk but the demand  is 
higher in September  to November  because  of lactation  stage.  With  this system,  
85% of the milk is produced  from grazed  grass compared  to the traditional

system  described  above.  This  means  that during  lactation  more  grazed  grass  was 
fed to the cows  and less of silage  and concentrate.  The problem  with the May/  
June surplus  continues  to exist in this system.  Figures  3 and 4 show the 
proportions  of milk  produced  from  the three  feed  sources  for the traditional  early  
calving  and the later March  calving  cows.
The later calving  system  at 2.6 cows/ha  produced  215 and 195 kg of milk  
fat and protein/cow,  respectively,  in 5600  L of milk. To achieve  this level of 
production  some  important  targets  with  regard  to cow and grazing  management  
need to be attained.  Compact  calving  of cows at the desired  date is essential.  
Grassland  management  is now more  critical  as a greater  proportion  of the cows  
diet during  lactation  is coming  from  grazed  grass.  Some  of the more  important  
factors  controlling  feed intake  at pasture  and milk yield of cows will now be 
considered.
Herbage  quality  and grazing  pressure
Grazing  experiments  during  1986-1990  (Stakelum  and Dillon,  1991)  using  
post-grazing  sward surface  height as a measure  of grazing  severity  under  
rotational  grazing,  established  the importance  of herbage  digestibility  on milk 
production  per cow. The overall  result from these experiments  was that the 
response  of dairy  cows  for the second  half  of lactation  to an extra 1 kg of DMI  
of pasture  was the production  of 1 kg of extra milk. This is at least the best 
response  possible  from  feeding  concentrates  at pasture  under  normal  conditions.  
This extra DMI from pasture  is achieved  by controlling  grazing  conditions  in 
order  to produce  dense  leafy  pastures  for the cows.  The financial  cost associated  
with this amounts  to zero because  it is not associated  with the purchase  of extra  
feed or the conservation  of forage  on the farm. In fact the benefits  are greater  
than  the extra  per  cow  production  achieved  because  pastures  which  are not either

concentrate  for early  March  calving  cows
12
Figure 5: Effect  of poor  grass  quality from July onwards
over or under  grazed  grow  much  better  and achieve  higher  spring  growth  rates  
in subsequent  years.  Additionally,  there  are also benefits  to be derived  in silage  
making  costs  as a greater  proportion  of total silage  can now be harvested  from  
the first cut in May.
One of the main  influences  on pasture  digestibility  is the proportion  of stem  
and dead material  present.  When  pastures  are under-grazed  during  April and 
May in a mistaken  effort  by farmers  to increase  intake,  stem elongation  occurs  
and the sward  achieves  a high rate of gross  herbage  production.  However,  the 
rate of pasture  senescence  also increases  dramatically  and the digestibility  of 
the pasture  declines.
Figure  5 outlines  the effect  of reduced  pasture  digestibility  on milk yield  per 
cow. The results  are an overall  summary  of 5 separate  whole  season  grazing  
experiments  where  different  pasture  digestibilities  were  evaluated  at a number  
of grazing pressures.  Cows  produced  about  an extra  50 kg (10 gals)  milk  during  
April-May  when  post-grazing  height  is at 8 cm or greater  compared  to tighter  
grazing.  However,  at equal grazing  pressure  later, cows lose 450 kg of milk 
(approx.  100 gals) due to the lower  pasture  digestibility.  This highlights  the 
importance  of grazing  relatively  tightly  (to 6 cm) in the period  of very active  
grass growth  (April-June).  The cows,  because  of the early  stage  of lactation  and 
the very high nutritive  value  of the herbage,  are well able to buffer  the effects  
of the high grazing  pressure.
Figure  6 outlines  what happens  where  grazing  pressure  is pitched  too high 
from  late June  onwards.  This means  grazing  below  8 cm. Cows  lose on average  
375 kg of milk  (80 gals).  This happens  whether  pasture  digestibility  is high or 
low. Too high  a grazing  pressure  is being  applied  on some  dairy  farms  in Ireland  
from July onwards  in an effort  to lengthen  the rotation  in order  to push grass
13
Figure  6: Effect  of too high a stocking  rate from  Juiy onwards
ahead  of the cows  into  the September-October  period.  Milk  production  per cow 
will suffer  as a result.  The logical  way to reduce  the autumn  deficit  is to use 
the correct  overall  stocking  rate and graze  the cows in such a way as to avoid  
depressing  their milk production  by large amounts.  This means  reducing  the 
grazing  pressure  from July onwards  (post-grazing  height  of 8 cm). The higher  
post-grazing  herbage  masses  will respond  by higher  growth  rates  in the recovery  
period.  The rotation  length  in the late summer/early  autumn  period  can only 
be lengthened  if grass supply  is high enough  to allow  for it. Otherwise  it will 
only be achieved  by low post-grazing  pasture  height  (or mass)  and a consequent  
reduction  in cow performance.
Figure  7 shows  what happens  if grazing  pressure  is lenient  in early season  
(>8 cm) and this reduced  quality  pasture  is subsequently  grazed  out by having  
a fairly high grazing  pressure  later on. This is not an uncommon  situation  on 
many  dairy farms  where  a buildup  of pasture  mass  occurs  in mid-summer  and 
this is eventually  grazed  out by the following  November/December.  In this 
situation  cows can lose up to 750 kg of milk (160 gals). The DMI is reduced  
by up to 4-5 kg mainly  because  of changes  in the ingestive  behaviour  of the 
cow. Prehension  of herbage  becomes  increasingly  difficult  for the cows  on the 
long  grass  due to the presence  of stem  and  dead  material  mixed  through  the green  
leaf canopy.  The digestibility  of the selected  material  falls (not as large as the 
depression  in the sward  digestibility).  Figure  8 shows  the milk production  per 
cow profile  for 4 farms  in the Cork area from pasture  from March  to August.  
These  farms  have  similar  calving  dates,  stocking  rates,  N input  and cow genetic  
merit  and yet by August  there is a difference  in milk production  of 7 kg/cow/  
day between  the farms. One succeeded  in achieving  high  production  throughout  
the whole  period.  The significant  point illustrated  here is that, by applying  the
14
Figure  7: Effect  of too high a stocking  rate and poor  grass  quality  from  July onwards
principles  outlined  of correct  grazing  height  during  the April/May  period  and 
from July onwards,  per cow performance  levels from pasture  similar  to the 
Curtins  farm can be achieved.
Topping  of pastures
Where  pastures  are undergrazed  by choice  in the April  to June  period  because  
of an unwillingness  of the farmer  to do so or because  it is physically  too difficult
Figure  8: Performance  for four farms  from  pasture
15
Figure  9: Effect  of very high grass  qualilty  on milk  yield
to do so because  of ground  conditions  and late turn-out,  topping  pastures  to 6 
cm can have a role in maintaining  pasture  digestibility.  Figure  9 outlines  the 
results  of recent  Moorepark  experiments  on this subject. Very  high  digestibility  
can be maintained  in the pastures  by mechanical  topping  during  stem  extension.  
It is vitally  important,  however,  to graze  these  pastures  at the correct  intensity  
later  on. Because  the tall grass  in close  proximity  to the faecal  deposits  has been  
defoliated  by topping  there will be less herbage  mass available  for grazing.  If 
previously  topped  swards  are grazed  at 8 cm from July onwards  an extra 375 
kg of milk (80 gals) per cow can be produced  compared  to the standard  milk 
production  profile  of the spring  calver.  Cows  grazing  these  swards  however  are 
more sensitive  to grazing  pressure  because  of the lower  available  herbage.  If 
grazing  is at 6 cm, cows  will lose about  84 kg of milk (18 gals).  The technique  
is most  suitable  on farms  which  have  below  optimum  stocking  rates  and  produce  
big surpluses  of grass in May. The toppings  can usefully  be grazed  in situ by 
other stock  on the farm.
Summary
Since the introduction  of milk quotas  the emphasis  has now shifted  to 
achieving  higher  performance  from  cows  and doing  this through  grazed  grass.  
Results  from  the present  experiment  at Curtins  has shown  that by a better  match  
of the feed demand  curve  to the grass  supply  curve,  a higher  proportion  of the 
milk  can be produced  during  the grazing  season  with much  reduced  concentrate  
inputs.  This means  calving  the cows closer  to the start of the grazing  season  
in March.  Also, by giving  the cows more land (10%),  the extra grass can be 
successfully  used to increase  performance  of the cows.
The most important  factors  which  affect  milk yield at pasture  (intake  and
16
digestibility  of the sward),  therefore,  need to be considered.  High intakes  at 
pasture  will occur  if the grazing  pressure  is very low. But because  of the nature  
of grass growth,  very lenient  grazing  pressures  will cause  large  declines  in the 
digestibility  of the sward  with  consequent  depressions  in intake  and  performance  
of cows.  Moorepark  grazing  experiments  over  the last 7 years  have  established  
the following  important  biological  responses:
1. Poor sward  digestibility  from July onwards  will cause  a loss of 90-100  
gallons  of milk per cow.
2. Too high a grazing  pressure  from July onwards  will cause  a loss of 80 
gallons  of milk per cow.
3. Imposing  too high a grazing  pressure  on poorer  quality  swards  will cause  
a loss of 160 gallons  of milk per cow.
4. Creating  very high digestibility  swards  by mechanical  topping  will give 
an extra  80 gallons  per cow from  July onwards  if those  swards  are grazed  
leniently  (>8 cm).  If they  are grazed  too tightly  (<8 cm) a loss  of 20 gallons  
per cow will result.
5. Grazing  paddocks  to the correct  height  from  April to  June  will create  high 
quality  pastures  for the remainder  of the grazing  season.  A penalty  of 10 
gallons  per cow results  from this compared  to leniently  grazing  those  
pastures  at that time.
It is, therefore,  a central  issue in grazing  management  for milk production,  
to graze  pastures  at the correct  severity  during  the first half  and the second  half 
of the grazing  season.  This can be done by using  feed budgeting.  This means  
making  decisions  on the overall  stocking  rate firstly.  Then the silage  conser ­
vation  programme  is decided.  These  two decisions  will determine  the effective  
stocking  rate during  the major  periods  of the grazing  season.  During  the season,  
day to day decisions  are made  on the basis of herbage  amount  or height  in the 
paddock  after  grazing.  Keeping  cows  longer  or shorter  in the paddock  to achieve  
this optimum  grazing  severity  is the corner  stone  of feed  budgeting.  A knowledge  
of grass supply  ahead  of the cows is important  in order  to anticipate  the onset  
of large  surpluses  or deficits.  This is got by a visual  assessment  of the amount  
of grass,  current  grass  growth  rate bulletins  from Teagasc  and the experience  
of the farmer  himself.
The  current  recommendation  from  Moorepark  to increase  the amount  of grass  
eaten by cows and increase  their milk production  is to allocate  more land to 
cows,  ie. drop  stocking  rate by 10% from 3.0 to 2.6 ha/cow  and continue  to use 
350 kg of N/ha to support  this. The post-grazing  severity  should  be 6 cm up 
to end of June and 8 cm later. The extra  land will allow  the grazing  season  to 
be significantly  extended.  For seasonal  milk production,  tbe cows  should  now 
be calved  closer  to grass.  This  also  allows  for an earlier  start  to the grazing  season  
because  of the lower  feed demand  (less cows now in milk in early March)  in 
early spring.
The challenge  is to get the parameters  which  adequately  describe  grazing  
severity  (height  of tall and short  grass and proportion  of each in the paddock)
17
communicated  clearly  at farm  level  so that farmers  can put these  very important  
grazing  principles  into practice  and increase  the productivity  of their cows  on 
pasture  and therefore  the returns  from dairying.

The Effects  of Ensiling  on Dry Matter  
Intake  and Animal  Performance

The maximum  profitability  from  Irish  dairying  in a quota  situation  will occur  
from the economical  production  of each litre of quota.  Therefore  in the mild 
Irish temperate  climate  which is favourable  to grass production,  maximum  
utilisation  of grazed  grass and conserved  forage  will be important  to achieve  
maximum  profitability.  Even with indications  of reductions  in cereal  prices,  
home produced  forage will still be competitive.  Fitzgerald  (1992) valued  
concentrates  and silage  on a metabolisable  energy  (M.E.)  basis.  He concluded  
that relative  to high quality  silage  (DMD  = 750 g/kg and M.E. = 10.8 mj/kg  
DM),  for concentrates  to be competitive  on a per unit M.E. basis,  prices  would  
have  to be in the region  of £71 or £99/tonne  depending  on whether  a land  charge  
was included  or not. Today  on most  intensive  dairy  and calf-to-beef  farms  silage  
accounts  for 25-35%  of the annual  feed dry matter  intake  while  grazed  grass  
and concentrates  represent  approximately  55-70%  and 5-10% respectively.  
These proportions  may change  in the future  due to an extended  grazing  season,  
lower  stocking  rates,  animals  of higher  genetic  merit,  cheaper  substitutes  or milk  
price  reductions.  However,  conserved  forage  is always  likely  to be a major  part 
of Irish  livestock  production  systems  bridging  a feeding  period  from  2-4 months  
on southerly  dry soils to 6 plus months  on wet drumlin  soil in the northern  half 
of the country.
Over  20 million  tonnes  of fresh  herbage  is ensiled  annually  in the Republic  
of Ireland  (Fig. 1). Grass  accounts  for over  99%  of forage  ensiled,  the remainder  
being  made  up of crops  such as maize,  whole  crop fodder  beet and whole  crop 
cereals.  The feeding  value of silage varies depending  on factors such as 
digestibility,  initial  rate of fermentation,  final fermentation  quality,  etc., which  
ultimately  affects  its intake  characteristics.
Grazed  grass v silage
Intake  by dairy  cattle  grazing  grass  during  a 21 day rotation  can be as high 
as 15-17  kg DM while  that for silage  is only  9-13 kg DM supporting  milk  yields  
of up to 26 and 16 kg/hd/day  respectively.  However,  such a simple  comparison  
is not scientifically  valid because  animal,  feed and management  factors  (Table  
1) are not standard.  In a grazing  situation  animals  have  the opportunity  to select  
fresh  leaf  and reject  stem,  dead  material,  and growth  around  dung  pads. However  
when  offered  precision  chopped  silage,  which  is usually  lower  in digestibility  
than grass,  the animal  is not able to select  leaf from stem and may eat pieces  
from the total botanical  mass,  i.e. leaf, stem,  dead material,  weed species,  etc. 
in one mouthfull.
During  the ensiling  process  herbage  is changed  from  its fresh  state  to a pickled  
one resulting  in many changes  in its chemical  composition  (Table  2). Two  main
19

Figure  1 - Changes  in forage  production  in Ireland  1975-1990
changes  occur  in the chemical  composition  of the herbage  during  the ensiling  
process.  Firstly  the water  soluble  carbohydrates  are broken down  to lactic  acid 
and volatile  fatty acids.  Secondly  the true protein  concentration  is reduced  from  
approximately  80% of the crude  protein  in the  parent  material  to approximately  
59% in silage.  These  changes  may have big effects  on the intake  and animal  
performance  potential  of the resultant  silage.  Feed  value  of any forage  is affected  
firstly  by its voluntary  intake  and secondly  by its efficiency  of utilisation.
As silage  is a fermented  feed containing  quantities  of volatile  fatty acids  and 
alcohols,  dry matter  can be underestimated  by oven  drying  at high  temperatures

due to loss of volatile  components.  In order  to account  for losses  in volatile  fatty  
acids and alcohols  the determination  of dry matter  of the silages  should  be 
estimated  using a toluene  distillation  technique,  e.g. that proposed  by Dewar  
and McDonald  (1961),  corrected  for losses  of alcohols.  The difference  in dry 
matter  concentration  between  oven drying  and toluene  distillation  varies  de­
pending  on many  factors  including  fermentation  quality  of the silage,  dry matter  
concentration,  additive  used, etc. Keady  (1991 - unpublished  data) noted  that 
the dry matter  concentration  of 20 silages  varied  from  6.1 to 14.3%  higher  when 
estimated  using  the toluene  distillation  method  of Dewar  and McDonald  (1961)  
relative  to oven drying  at 85°C for 24 hours.
Ensiling  and its effect  on intake  
Sheep
Most of the initial  work carried  out examining  the effects  of ensiling  per­
se on forage  dry matter  intake was carried  out using sheep. Data from 65 
comparisons  in which  the intakes  of the parent  herbage  and the resultant  silages  
were compared  are presented  in Table  3. Intake  of silage  dry matter  by sheep  
varied  from as low as 38% (Harris  and Raymond,  1963) to as high as 84% 
(Demarquilly  and Dulphy,  1977)  of that of the parent  herbage.  From  the mean  
of 24 comparisons  in which  the silages  were well preserved,  as measured  by 
pH being  less than 4.2, ensiling  per-se  decreased  forage  dry matter  intake  of 
sheep  by 30%.  However  when the silages  were  poorly preserved  from  the mean 
of 41 comparisons  ensiling  per-se  decreased  dry matter  intake  of sheep  by 41 %. 
Ensiling  had little effect  on dry matter  digestibility  increasing  it by 1% and 
decreasing  it by 2%, for well and poorly  preserved  silages  respectively.
However  these data need to be interpreted  cautiously  when using them to

draw  conclusions  on the effect  of ensiling  on intake.  Some  of the comparisons  
were confounded  firstly  by poor fermentation  quality  of the resultant  silages  
and secondly  by the method  of determination  of the dry matter  concentration  
of the silage.  Also,  sheep  are more  sensitive  than cattle  to factors  such as silage  
fermentation  quality,  dry matter  concentration,  chop  length,  etc. Michalet  (1975)  
reported  that relative  to the fresh  herbage  sheep  ingested  59 and 20% less dry 
matter  when offered  the resultant  flail cut and precision  chop silages  respec ­
tively.  Possible  positive  effects  of the shorter  chop length  on intake  are firstly  
improvements  in silage  fermentation  quality,  secondly  increased  rates of pas­
sage  of the forage  through  the intestine  and thirdly  decreases  in the time  between  
the end of eating  and the beginning  of rumination.
Sheep  relative  to cattle
Data  from  seven  comparisons  in which  the same  parent  herbage  and resultant  
silages  were  fed to both sheep  and heifers  are presented  in Table  4. These  data, 
in which  the silages  were  of a good  fermentation  quality  and precision  chopped,  
illustrate  two important  points.  Firstly,  heifers  consumed  approximately  the 
same quantity  of dry matter  when the parent  herbage  was offered  in the fresh

or ensiled  form. Secondly,  using  the same forages  sheep  consumed  18% less 
forage  dry matter  in the ensiled  relative  to the fresh  state. Therefore  it is clear  
from the  data  presented  in Table  4 that  the sheep  is a poor  indicator  of the intake  
characteristics  of the mature  bovine  in a production  system  based on silage  
feeding.
Growing  and finishing  cattle
The  data  from  12 comparisons  in which  the effects  of ensiling  per-se  on forage  
dry matter  intake  and animal  performance  was investigated  are presented  in 
Table 5. All silages  were well preserved  as measured  by ammonia  nitrogen  
concentrations.  It should  be noted that one of the silages  reported  by Flynn  
(1978)  which  had a pH of 4.6 was wilted  prior  to ensiling.  Ensiling  tended  to 
reduce  forage  dry matter  intake  by 6% relative  to that of the parent  herbage.  
Other  than the  trial of Noller  etal.  (1963)  who  reported  a decrease  in dry matter  
intake  of 29% due to ensiling,  the 11 other  comparisons  reported  variations  in 
intake  from  -11 % to +6%. From  the data  of the six comparisons  in which  animal  
performance  was measured  as daily liveweight  gain, ensiling  per-se  reduced  
daily liveweight  gain by 25%, varying  from -35% (Wilkinson  et al., 1976)  to 
-11% (O’Kiely  and Flynn,  1982).  However  in the four comparisons  in which  
carcass  gain  was measured  ensiling  reduced  animal  performance  by 8%, ranging  
from -15% (Flynn,  1978) to an increase  of 1% (Flynn,  1978).
Current  research  at Moorepark
There  are little data available  in the literature  on the effects  of ensiling  on 
forage  intake  and animal performance  of lactating  dairy cattle.  Therefore  as part 
of an ongoing  series of studies  at Moorepark  investigating  intake  and perform ­
ance on grass silage diets an experiment  was initiated  using dairy cows to 
examine  the effects  of ensiling  per se on
(1) forage  dry matter  intake
(2) efficiency  of utilisation  of forage  for milk production,  and
(3) digestibility  of forages.
During April  and May 1992  herbage  from a silage  sward  which had not been 
grazed  since the previous  autumn  was zero grazed  by cows in late lactation  
indoors.  During  the same  time similar  herbage  was harvested  with a precision

chop harvester.  Alternative  loads were ensiled  unwilted,  using good ensiling  
techniques  in 100 1 unwalled  clamps  either  untreated  or treated  with  formic  acid 
at 2.5 l/t. Eight  weeks  after  ensiling  the silages  were  fed as the sole diet to cows  
of equal  parity,  liveweight,  at a similar  milk yield level and stage  of lactation  
as those fed the parent  herbage  previously.
At ensiling  the grass was of moderate  ensilability  having  dry matter,  water  
soluble  carbohydrate  and nitrate  concentrations  and buffering  capacity  of 163 
g/kg, 154 g/kg DM, 1000  mg/kg  juice  and 590 mEq/kg  D.M.  respectively.  The 
chemical  composition  of the diets at feeding  are presented  in Table 6. The 
untreated  and formic  acid treated  silages  were well preserved,  having  pH’s of 
3.94 and 3.93 and ammonia  nitrogen  concentrations  of 95 and 75 g/kg total 
nitrogen  respectively.  Both silage  treatments  tended  to have higher  concentra ­
tions of dry matter,  modified  acid detergent  fibre and crude  fibre, and lower  
concentrations  of neutral  detergent  fibre compared  to the parent  herbage.
The effects  of ensiling  on forage  dry matter  intake  and animal  performance  
are presented  in Table  7. Compared  to the parent  herbage,  the untreated  silage  
significantly  decreased  forage  dry matter  intake  by 9% whereas  the decrease  
of 5% with formic  acid treatment  was not significant.  The decrease  in intake  
of the formic  acid treated  silage  is in accordance  with  the data  reported  in Table  
5; from  the mean  of 12 comparisons  silage  dry matter  intake  was decreased  by 
6%. Relative  to the parent  herbage  the untreated  and formic  acid treatments  
significantly  decreased  milk  yield  by 22%  and 20%;  milk  protein  concentration  
by 9.1% and 8.8%;  fat and protein  yield  by 28% and 24%;  and the yield of fat 
plus protein  per kg dry matter  intake  by 25 and 25% respectively.  The decrease  
in animal  performance  due to ensiling  is probably  due to two factors.  Firstly,  
silage  only  diets  result  in a lower  microbial  nitrogen  flow from the rumen.  ARC

(1984)  reported  microbial  nitrogen  flows in sheep of 1.43, 0.71 and 1.15 g 
nitrogen  incorporated  to microbial  nitrogen  per  MJ metabolisable  energy  in diets  
consisting  of grass,  silage  and silage  plus concentrates  respectively.  Secondly,  
apparently  ensiling  results  in a lower  efficiency  of utilisation  of metabolisable  
energy  for animal  production.  Similarly  the decreases  in animal  performance  
of the dairy cow recorded  in the present  study are in line with the data from  
six comparisons  reported  in Table  5 in which  the performance  of beef cattle  
was measured  as daily liveweight  gain.
At present,  in Moorepark,  there  is on-going  research  into verifying  the effects  
of ensiling  per-se  on forage  dry matter  intake  and animal  performance.  An 
understanding  of the factors  affecting  silage  intake  may in the future  result  in 
the development  of technology  to increase  animal  product  output  from con­
served  forage.  Also,  work  is ongoing  evaluating  possible  ways  of reducing  the 
difference  in animal  performance  obtained  when  the parent  herbage  is offered  
in the fresh or ensiled  state.
Conclusions
A large proportion  of the previous  work comparing  grass and silage  used 
sheep  as the experimental  animal.  Sheep  are more sensitive  than cattle  to the 
effects  of ensiling  on forage  intake,  being  sensitive  to factors  such  as chop  length,  
dry matter  concentration,  volatile  fatty acid concentrations,  digestibility,  etc. 
and have now been shown  not to be reliable  indicators  of intake  in the bovine.  
Some  comparisons  with beef cattle  reported  effects  on intake  due to ensiling  
of -29 to 6% and on liveweight  gain of -35 to -11%.  From  the current  work  at 
Moorepark  ensiling  reduces  the efficiency  of utilisation  of forage  for milk  
production.  The Moorepark  experiment  reported  has shown  that with lactating  
dairy cattle  a well preserved  formic  acid treated  silage  compared  to the parent  
herbage  did not significantly  reduce  dry matter  intake  but reduced  fat and protein  
yield by 24 percent.  Further  work is ongoing  to identify  ways of improving  
animal  product  output  from  silage.  Strategies  employed  could  involve  different  
types  of supplements,  better  management  of the grass  crop for ensiling  and on 
the day of harvesting  and the use of particular  additives  at ensiling.  Some  
bacterial  inoculants  have given  improvements  in animal  performance  through  
increases  in forage  intake  (Gordon,  1989; Mayne,  1990; Keady  and Steen, 
1993b),  digestibility  (Keady  et al., 1993; Keady  and Steen, 1993b)  and in 
efficiency  of utilisation  of digestible  energy  (Keady  and Steen, 1993a).

Trace  Element  Deficiency  in Irish Dairy  
Herds

The sheep  and cattle  are just not doing  well, even though  they seem  to be 
getting  plenty  of feed. Do you think  it could  be a mineral  deficiency? ’ Although  
this quote  is from New ^aland  (Clark  and Towers,  1983) it could  easily  be 
attributed  to an Irish  farmer.  While  nutritional  disorders,  including  deficiencies,  
are of more  significant  consequence  than are infectious  diseases  in developing  
countries  (McDowell,  1987),  their economic  significance  in developed  coun ­
tries is contested.  Kitwood  0991)  stated  that the understanding  of the impor ­
tance of adequate  trace element  status and the availability  of trace element  
supplements  is such that deficiencies  seldom  occur on British  dairy farms.  
However,  Howie  (1992)  observed  that management  changes  in recent  years  in 
the U.K. have seen much greater  utilization  of home-grown  feed, more spe­
cialized  pasture  grasses  and fertilizer  regimes,  more  purchase  of supplementary  
feed in “straight ” form, more use of maize  silage  and significant  changes  in 
calving  patterns,  with more cows calving  in late summer  without  receiving  
concentrate  feeding  during  the dry period.  All of these  factors  may predispose  
to mineral  deficiencies  in dairy herds.
The national  averages  for trace-element  composition  (mg/kg  DM) of Irish  
herbages  indicate  that, in general,  Irish  herbages  are low  in copper  (6.9),  iodine  
(0.19)  and selenium  (0.095)  and high in molybdenum  (2.1),  (Rogers,  Fleming  
and Gately,  1989).  Assuming  90 to 95  per cent  of the feed  intake  of dairy  cows  
consists  of grazed  or conserved  herbage  then the trace element  status  of dairy  
cows is dependent  primarily  on forage  trace  element  status.  This is particularly  
important  during  the latter  part of the grazing  season  and during  the dry period  
when supplementation  is generally  not practised.
According  to Rogers  et al. (1989) the most  important  trace  element  deficien ­
cies affecting  Irish  cattle  are those  of copper,  selenium,  iodine  and cobalt. Three  
surveys  of blood  vitamin  B 12 status  (inferential  cobalt  status)  of Irish cattle  
have shown  that between  7 and 12 per cent of herds  had a very low (< 100 pg/ 
ml)  B12 status,  (Poole,  O’Connor  and  Rogers,  1983;  Poole,  Rogers  and O’Connor,  
1984;  Rogers  and Poole,  1984).  However,  Rogers  and Poole  (1984)  stated  that 
there  are technical  problems  in cattle  plasma  vitamin  B12 analysis  which  restrict  
its value as a confirmatory  test of cobalt  deficiency.  In the only study of the 
plasma  inorganic  iodine  status  of Irish herds,  Rogers  (1992)  found  that 19 per 
cent of 158 herds had a very low (<100  ng/ml)  iodine  status  (Table  1). These  
data were  compiled  from  routine  analyses  conducted  on samples  received  from  
veterinary practitioners  and, as such,  may not be representative  of normal herds  
not under  veterinary  investigation.

selenium  status  (Table  1). In contradistinction,  selenium  toxicity  is rare in Irish 
cattle  (Rogers,  Arora,  Fleming,  Crinion  and McLaughlin,  1990).  Results  from  
routine  analysis  on samples  collected  by veterinary  practitioners  between  1984  
and 1987 indicate  no consistent  trend or change  over time in cattle blood  
selenium  status (Poole  and Rogers,  1987a).
While the base-line  surveys  of cattle blood copper  status (copper  or 
ceruloplasmin)  conducted  in the Republic  of Ireland  showed  that the majority  
of herds have a suboptimal  copper  status (Table 1), studies  conducted  in 
Northern  Ireland  found  a much  lower  prevalence  of copper  deficiency  (Table
1).
Results  from routine  analysis  of samples  from veterinary  practitioners  be­
tween 1984 and 1987 in Grange  Research  Centre  show no consistent  changes  
over time in cattle blood  copper  status (Poole  and Rogers,  1987a).

This  review  of the available  published  data  on the blood  trace  elements  status  
of Irish cattle shows  that no base-line  survey  of Irish cattle  plasma  inorganic  
iodine  status  has been conducted  and the most  recent  base line surveys  of Irish  
cattle blood copper  and selenium  status were conducted  ten years ago. The 
objective  of this project  was to establish  the iodine,  copper  and selenium  status  
of dairy herds in the South  of Ireland  during  the spring  and autumn  of 1991.
Materials  and methods
Herd  selection:  The 50 dairy  herds  sampled  were  selected  because  they were  
participating  in a computerized  management  information  system  (DAIRYMIS),  
(Crosse,  1986).  As this was a base-line  study,  a farm  history  of clinical  problems  
or trace element  deficiency  was not used as a selection  criterion.  Farms  were  
located  in counties  Cork  (n=26),  Tipperary  (n=20),  Waterford  (n=3)  and Clare  
(n=l). These are predominantly  spring-calving  (December  to May) herds  
varying  in size from 33 to 293 cows. The physical  performance,  grassland  
management  and calving  and fertility  records  of these  farms  in 1991 are shown  
in Tables  2, 3, 4 and 5.
Sample  collection:  Samples  were  collected  during  the spring  of 1991 from  
dry cows only, and during  the autumn  of 1991 from lactating  cows only.  
Approximately  ten cows  per herd were sampled  in the spring  and ten cows  or 
ten per cent of the herd, which  ever  was the greater,  was sampled  in the autumn  
(Tables  6 and 7). The farmer  was asked to present  cows of different  ages,  
excluding  maiden  heifers.
All samples  were  collected  during  the morning  (8.00  -13.00  hrs)  by coccygeal  
venepuncture  into vacutainer  tubes containing  lithium  heparin.
Laboratory  analyses  : All samples  were analyzed  at Grange  Research  
Centre.  The copper  concentration  of whole  blood  samples  was determined  by 
atomic  absorption  spectrophotometry  (Spillane,  1966; Hilliard,  1979). The

activity  of  erythrocyte  glutathione  peroxidase  was  measured  by spectrophotometry  
based  on the method  of Paglia  and Valentine  ( 1967). Plasma  inorganic  iodine  
was determined  by a chromatographic  and colorimetric  technique  developed  
by Aumont  (1986).  The method  used for haemoglobin  measurement  (Anon,  
1969) was based  on the cyanmethaemoglobin  procedure.
Herd  classification:  The trace element  status  of each herd was classified  
based  on the mean  value  of the individual  sample  results  into  one  of six categories  
(Table  8). These  are the same break-points  used by the Teagasc  laboratory  at 
Grange  Research  Centre  to classify  the status  of samples  routinely  submitted  
by veterinary  practitioners.
Results
The mean (SD), minimum  and maximum  individual  animal  blood trace  
element  values  in spring  and autumn  1991 are shown  in Table  9. The data in 
Table  10 show  that only three  of the herds had a low copper  status  in the spring  
while  none had a very low copper  status.  Almost  half (n=24)  of all herds  had 
a normal  copper  status  during  the spring.  The  copper  status  of herds  in Tipperary  
was better  (16/20  herds  normal)  than that of herds  in Cork  (5/26  herds  normal).  
Over  one third of herds  had a very low selenium  status  in the spring  (Table  10) 
with a further  18 per cent  classified  as low selenium  status. The selenium  status  
of herds  in Tipperary  was better  (9/20  herds  normal)  than that of herds  in Cork
33
(5/26 herds normal).  Approximately  three-quarters  (72%)  of herds  had a low 
or very low iodine  status  in the spring  (Table  10). The iodine  status  of herds  
in Tipperary  was better  (7/20  herds  normal  or high)  than that of herds  in Cork  
(4/26 herds normal).
Two  of the low copper  status  herds  in the spring  also had very low selenium  
and iodine  status  while  the third low copper  status  herd had also had very low 
selenium  status.  Eight  of the very low selenium  status  herds  in the spring  did 
not have very low copper  or iodine  status  and ten had very low iodine  status  
also.  Nine  of the very  low iodine  herds  did not have  a very  low  copper  or selenium  
status.  Thus,  over half (54%)  of all herds were classified  as very low in one 
or more trace elements  in the spring.

The results  from the blood  sampling  survey  conducted  in autumn  1991 are 
shown  in Table 11. None  of the farms  had a very low copper  status  and only 
two farms  had a low blood  copper  status.  The copper  status  of herds in Cork  
was better  (10/16  herds normal)  than that of herds in Tipperary  (4/20 herds  
normal).  Half  of all herds  had a low or very low selenium  status  in the autumn  
(Table  11). The selenium  status  of herds  in Tipperary  was better  (11/20  herds  
normal)  than that of herds  in Cork  (4/26  herds  normal).  Almost  ninety  per cent 
(86%)  of herds  had a low or very low blood  iodine  status  in the autumn  (Table  
11). The percentage  of herds  with low or very low blood  iodine  status  did not 
differ  greatly  between  counties.
One of the low copper  status  herds in the autumn  also had very low iodine  
status  and the other also had very low selenium  status.  Three  of the very low 
selenium  status  herds  in the autumn  did not have  very  low copper  or iodine  status  
and twelve  also had very low iodine  status. Twenty  three  of the very  low iodine  
status  herds  in the autumn  did not have a very low copper  or selenium  status.  
Thus,  over three-quarters  (76%)  of all herds  were classified  as very low in one 
or more trace elements  in the autumn.
The distribution  of herds in the autumn  which  were classified  as normal,  
marginal,  low or very  low trace  elements  status  in the spring  is shown  in Table  
12. While  the majority  (96%)  of herds  classified  as normal  or rharginal  copper  
status  in the spring  were again  classified  as normal  or marginal  copper  status  
in the autumn,  none  of the three  herds  classified  as low copper  status  in the spring  
had a low copper  status  in the autumn  (Table  12). Approximately  three-quarters

(74%)  of herds  classified  as normal  or marginal  selenium  status  in the spring  
had a similar  status  in the autumn  (Table  12). Likewise,  77% of herds  classified  
as low or very low selenium  status in the spring  were classified  in the same  
categories  in the autumn.  While  only 14 per cent of herds  classified  as normal  
or marginal  iodine  status  in the spring  had a similar  autumn  status,  eighty  six 
per cent of herds  classified  as low or very low iodine  status  in the spring  had 
a similar  autumn  status (Table  12).
Discussion
The data presented  on the physical  performance  and grassland  management  
of the farms  sampled  (Tables  2, 3, 4 and 5) show that these farms  are repre ­
sentative  of intensive  progressive  dairy farming  in the south  of Ireland,  which  
is the main dairying  area of Ireland.  Their  farming  performance  is comparable  
with the top twenty  five per cent (ranked  on margin  over  feed and fertilizer  per 
1000 gallons)  of all farm data recorded  on the DAIRYMIS  management  
information  system  (Cliffe,  1990).
The proportion  of herds  with a low or marginal  copper  status  (0.44-0.68  ug/ 
ml) in both the spring  and autumn  in this study (52-72%)  is similar  to the 
proportion  of herds  (35-80%)  with a marginal  or low copper  status  (0.40-0.75  
ug/ml)  reported  in previous  Irish studies  (Table  1 ). However,  the absence  of 
very low copper  status  herds  (<0.44  ug/ml)  in this study  is in contrast  with all 
of the earlier  Irish studies  which  found  that between  10 and 26 per cent of herds  
had a very low copper  status  (Table  1). The data reported  here are similar  to 
more recent  Irish data which  showed  that only one to two per cent of herds  had 
a very low copper  status  (Poole  and Rogers,  1987a).  Differences  between  this 
and previous  studies  reflect  differences  in survey  location,  sample  collection  
procedures  and possibly  increased  awareness  of hypocuprosis.
The proportion  of herds  with a very low inferential  selenium  status  (<35 iu 
GPX/g  HB) in both the spring  and autumn  in this study (30-36%)  is similar  to 
that reported  by Poole  et al. (1983)  and Rogers  and Poole  (1984)  for very low 
selenium  status (<25 iu GPX/g  Hb) herds. Both Poole et al. (1984) and 
McMurray and Rice  (1982)  found  a much  higher  proportion  of herds  with  a very 
low selenium  status,  76% and 85%,  respectively,  in mainly  dairy  farms  around  
the Shannon  estuary  and suckler  farms  in the North  of Ireland.  These  differences  
reflect  differences  in geographical  location,  animal type and management  
practices.
While  there  are no comparable  data available  on the plasma  inorganic  iodine  
status of Irish dairy herds,  Rogers  (1992)  stated that over a two year period  
between  33% and 70% of herds from twelve  counties  had a low or very low 
iodine  status. Previously,  Rogers  and Poole  (1989)  had confirmed  severe  iodine  
deficiency  (<20  PII ug/ml)  in eight  counties.  The  prevalence  of goitre  and thyroid  
hyperplasia  in cases  of bovine  perinatal  mortality  reported  by Mee (1991a  and 
1991b)  provide  additional  evidence  of iodine  deficiency  in Irish dairy herds.
In all herds  where  a low copper  status  was detected  there was a concurrent
37
very low iodine  or very low selenium  status.  This reflects  the high prevalence  
of very low iodine  and very low selenium  herds  in the survey.  While  combined  
very low selenium  and iodine  herd status  occurred  twice  as frequently  as very 
low selenium  status  alone,  22 and 11 herds  respectively,  very low iodine  status  
alone  (32 herds)  was more  frequently  detected  than combined  very low iodine  
and selenium  (22 herds).  This  reflects  the greater  prevalence  of very low iodine  
than very low iodine  and selenium  status  herds  in this study.  While  Rogers  et 
al. (1989)  stated that deficiencies  of trace elements  may arise singly or in 
combination,  there  are no published  data  on the combined  deficiencies  detected  
here in Irish herds.
Herd  copper  status  did not vary greatly  between  spring  and autumn  (Table  
12). This reflects  the fact that at both sampling  periods  cows were generally  
not fed concentrate  ration.  Poole  etal. (1983)  found  that while  herd  copper  status  
declined  during  the summer,  with  higher  values  from  January  to June,  they  noted  
that these data referred  to different  farms  and different  locations  in Kerry  for 
each  monthly  mean  value.  O’ Farrell,  MacCarthy , Crinion  and Sherington  (1986)  
reported  that blood  copper  concentration  declined  from  a peak  in May  to a trough  
in November  in a single  dairy  herd monitored  over a year and a half.  Although  
there  was  considerable  variation  in selenium  status  of herds  between  spring and 
autumn  in this study  (Table  12) normal/marginal  herds  in the spring  tended  to 
remain  so in the autumn  and low/very  low herds  in the spring  tended  to have  
a similar  status  in the autumn.  Poole  et al. (1983)  showed  that selenium  status  
tended  to be relatively  high and rising  in spring  and declined  over the summer  
to a trough  in August  or September.  There  was a trend  in the present  data  towards  
a lower iodine status in the autumn  compared  to the spring (Table  12). 
This  may be  due to differences  in iodine  intake, seasonal  effects  and physiologi ­
cal status.
The finding  that over half of all herds  in the spring  and over three  -quarters  
of all herds in the autumn  were classified  as very low in one or more trace  
elements  is perhaps  surprising  considering  the levels  of physical,  calving  and 
fertility  performance  achieved  on these  farms  (Tables  2, 3,4 and 5). However,  
healthy  herds  often show abnormal  blood  or feed tests (Rogers  et al., 1989),  
hence,  blood  tests alone will not identify  deficient  herds. Diagnosis  of trace  
element  responsive-disorders  should  be based on the presence  of clinical  or 
subclinical  signs  together  with low or very low mineral  status  in blood  and on 
the response  to specific  mineral  supplementation.

Systems  of Beef Production  Using  
Continental  Cross Cattle  from the 
Suckler  Herd
M. J. DRENNAN
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath
Where  clearly  demonstrated  financial  benefits  are shown,  beef  farmers  have  
responded by making the necessary changes.  One such  example  in recent  years  
has been the'change  to continental  breeds.  Estimates  made  in the late seventies  
showed  that  only  6 to 8% of the national  calf  crop  were  continental  crosses  which  
increased to 17% in 1985 and 48% in 1993 (Figure  1). In fact, recent  estimates  
(Drennan  and Power,  1993)  show that 84% of mature  suckler  cows and 50% 
of suckler  replacement  heifers  are bred to continental  sire breeds.  This major  
change  in breeding  policy  was  due  to the high  growth  potential  of the continentals  
and the higher  prices  for the better  quality  carcasses,  i.e., leaner  and of good  
conformation  (Keane,  1992).  The introduction  of milk quotas  in 1984 resulted  
in decreased  calf supplies  from the dairy  herd resulting  in increased  calf prices  
which  lead to an increase  in suckler  cow numbers.  This increase  subsequently  
gained  momentum  following  improved  suckler  cow premiums.  As a result,  
suckler  cow numbers  have increased  from  0.44 million  in 1984 to 0.98 million  
in 1993 (Table  1).
While  financial  benefits  could be clearly  shown  for increasing  the use of 
continental  sire breeds  and increasing  suckler  cow numbers  the financial  gain 
to the individual  producer  as a result  of opting  for a specific  production  system  
were not as clear. The main reason  was the uncertainty  and variation  in beef 
prices  throughout  the year. A further  complication  at present  is eligibility  for 
cattle  premiums  which  is influenced  by stocking  rate requirements,  quotas  in 
the case of suckler  cow numbers,  a maximum  of 90 animals  in the case of beef 
premia  and for the slaughter  premium  period  of slaughter  (January  1 to April  
30). In this paper,  it is attempted  to provide  guidelines  for non-disadvantaged  
areas  of optimum  production  systems  for suckler  herds  within  which  the progeny  
are taken  to slaughter  or where  male  progeny  are purchased  at weaning  and taken  
to slaughter.

Distribution  of slaughterings
Before  discussing  details  of systems  it is necessary  to briefly  discuss  the 
impact  of the Common  Agricultural  Policy  Reforms  (1992). These  reforms  will 
involve  a reduction  in intervention  purchases  and lower  intervention  prices.  This 
will be offset  by increased  payments  directly  to farmers  in the form  of the various  
premia.  Because  of the high proportion  of Irish beef which  must be exported  
and the distance  from the main markets  of Europe,  Ireland  has relied  heavily  
on intervention  in the past.  In the future,  a greater  proportion  of beef  will have  
to be marketed  directly  rather  than through  intervention.  For orderly  marketing  
a relatively  even supply  of beef  throughout  the year is important.  While  heifer  
and cow slaughterings  at meat export  premises  have been relatively  evenly  
spread  throughout  the year there has been a pronounced  seasonality  in steer  
slaughterings with a  larger  proportion  in autumn  (Figure  2). In fact the position  
has deteriorated  over the years in that 32% were slaughtered  in the October/  
December  period  in the years 1973 to 1978, while  the corresponding  figures  
were  37% for the years 1979  to 1984,47%  for 1985 to 1990 and 41%  for 1991 
and 1992.  Economic  factors  were  the major  reasons  for this change.  Intervention,  
aids to private  storage  (APS)  and export  refunds  in recent  years ensured  a 
satisfactory  price  for finished  animals  in autumn  and resulted  in an escalation  
in store  prices  thereby  reducing  the economic  returns  from  winter  finishing.  The 
slaughter  premium  payable  on steers  slaughtered  during  the first four months  
of the year  should  improve  the distribution  of steer  slaughterings  but if removed  
there is the danger  of a return  to the original  position.
Suckler  cow systems
The systems  examined  are based  on Grange  data using  Limousin  x Friesian  
cows.  Sires  of the larger  continental  breeds  (Charolais)  are used  on mature  cows  
and easy calving  Limousin  sires on heifers.  High quality  silage  (ensiled  May 
20 to 27, DMD  74%)  is fed to the progeny  in winter  while  cows  receive  lower  
quality material  (ensiled  late July,  DMD  64%).  Cows  are fed a mineral/vitamin  
supplement  with silage  in winter.
Three  spring  calving  systems  are compared  and high animal  performance  
is assumed.  In each system  heifers  are taken  to slaughter  at 20 months  of age. 
The systems  involve  different  slaughter  ages for the male progeny.
The systems  are:
steers  slaughtered  at 24 months,  1.9 acres (0.77 ha) of 
grassland  per cow unit
steers slaughtered  at 29 months,  2.2 acres (0.89 ha) of 
grassland  per cow unit
bulls slaughtered  at 16 months,  1.6 acres (0.65 ha) of 
grassland  per cow unit
All systems  are at a similar  stocking  density  and the total input  of nitrogenous  
fertiliser  is approximately  95 kg per acre (235 kg per ha). In system  A, steers  
are finished  at the end of their second  winter,  whereas  in system  B, steers  are 
put to grass  for a third  grazing  season.  In system  C, young  bulls  are slaughteredA. (Steers  24 m)

following  an extended  winter  feeding  period  of 8 months.  Daily concentrate  
feeding  levels  are: 1 kg for weanlings  (steers  and heifers),  4.5 kg for young  bulls,  
4 kg for finishing  steers  and 3 kg for finishing  heifers.  Where  steers  are let to 
pasture  for a third  grazing  season  (system  B) no concentrates  are fed during  the 
second  winter  period.
Carcass  weight  (kg) of males  for systems  A, B and C are 390, 420 and 350 
kg, respectively.  Heifers  in all systems  have  carcass  weights  of 300 kg. Carcass  
prices  are 229.3  and 220.5  p/kg  for males  and heifers,  respectively.  This  assumes  
that young  bulls obtain  a similar  price to steers  and that there is no effect  of 
time of year when slaughtered  on price obtained.
The premia  payable  for each system  are those  applicable  in 1994  and amount  
to £113,  £84 and £93 per acre for systems  A, B and C, respectively  (Table  2). 
In addition  to the suckler  cow premium,  system  A receives  the beef  premium  
for males  at 10 and 22 months  of age and the slaughter  premium,  system  B 
receives  the beef  premium  at 10 and 22 months  while system C  (bulls)  receives  
only  the beef  premium  at 10 months.  The  extensification  premium  is not included  
for any system.  As actual  grass  acreage  is used, it is reasonable  to assume  that 
on most  farms  this amounts  to about  90% of map acres.  Using  this adjustment  
the stocking  rates  for all three  systems  are below  the 0.81 livestock  units (L.U.)  
per acre (2 L.U. per ha) necessary  for premia  in the final (1996)  eligibility  
specifications.  It is noticeable  that with inclusion  of replacements  the stocking  
rate of system  B would  approach  eligibility  for the extensification  premium.  
It is assumed  that the premia  shown  are actually  obtained  and in this respect  
there is very little freedom  regarding  the 22 month  beef premium  and the 
slaughter  premium  when animals  are slaughtered  at 2 years (System  A).
Interest  is charged  on all working  capital  but no charge  for housing  or labour  
is included  in the calculations.  Inclusion  of the slaughter  premium  for steers

the absence  of the slaughter  premium  if there was a price  differential  of 15 p/ 
kg of carcass  for steers  slaughtered  in March  above  that for steers  slaughtered  
in the July/September  period.  The bull system  (C) had a considerably  lower  
income  per cow than the other  two systems  and an income  per acre of £142.  
However,  with a fixed cow quota  and assuming  that land is not limiting  then 
the bull system  would  result  in reduced  premia  (no 22 month  beef  premium  or 
slaughter  premium)  and lower  total income  on a farm basis.
Total  costs  per kg of liveweight  and carcass  weight  produced  are shown  in 
Table  4. Due to differences  in killing-out  percentage,  carcass  weight  provides  
a better  assessment  than liveweight.  The system  (B) producing  steers at 29 
months  of age produced  beef at lower  cost per kg than the other  two systems.  
This is expected  as concentrate  inputs  (and costs)  were lower  for this system  
although  interest  on animals  were  higher  as animals  were retained  for a longer  
period.  The higher  premia  for the 24 month  system  (received  the slaughter  
premium)  resulted  in higher  incomes  from the spring system  (System  A). 
Therefore,  while  grass  finishing  systems  with  lower  variable  costs  result  in lower  
costs  per kg of carcass  produced  cattle  prices  and premia  also have  a major  effect  
on incomes  and in this instance  more than offset  the higher  production  costs.

Weaning  to slaughter  systems  for steers  or bulls
Many producers  purchase  suckled  weanlings  and take them through  to 
slaughter.  Assuming  similar  slaughter  ages, weights  and prices  as shown  for 
systems  A, B and C the grassland  area required  for systems  Al (steers  24 
months),  B1 (steers  29 months)  and Cl (bulls 16 months)  from weaning  at 8 
months  of age to slaughter  are 1.0 (0.40),  1.6 (0.65)  and 0.27 (0.11)  acres  (ha), 
respectively.  While  both steer systems  qualify  for the total premia  in 1994 at 
both the 10 and 22 months  only 60% of bulls  qualify  for the 10 month  premium  
(1.21 livestock  units per acre) assuming  no other  animals  are available  on the 
farm and actual  rather  than adjusted  acres  are used.  It is assumed  that steers  and 
bulls are purchased  at 300 kg liveweight  at a cost of £480 per head.
The incomes  per acre are £174,  £107 and £141 for steers  slaughtered  at 24 
months  (Al),  steers  slaughtered  at 29 months  (Bl) and bulls slaughtered  at 16 
months  (Cl), respectively  (Table 5). The results again indicate  the better

Changing  the sale price  by 10 p/kg  of carcass  changes  incomes  per acre by £39, 
£26 and £130 from weanling  to beef systems  Al, Bl and Cl, respectively.  
Likewise,  changing  purchase  price  would  have a far greater  effect  on incomes  
per acre from the bull system  than from the two steer systems.
Total  costs  per kg of carcass  gain is £1.98,  £1.80  and £1.78  for systems  Al, 
Bl and Cl, respectively  (Table  6). This again  shows  that production  costs are

steers  slaughtered  at 24 months  give a considerably  higher  income  per acre than 
the other two systems.
In 1996, the special  beef premium  will be increased  to £87.9  per head on 
each occasion  and stocking  rate requirements  will be 0.81 LU per acre. An 
examination  of incomes  for the three  weanling  to beef  systems  for 1996 shows  
that 74% of the animals  in the 24 month  steer  system  and only 40%  of the bulls  
would  qualify.  In these  circumstances,  the 24 month  old steer  system  would  still 
provide  the highest  income  per acre  while  the difference  between  systems  would  
be reduced  (Table  7). The bull system  would  give the lowest  income  per acre. 
As an indication  of the importance  of the beef  premium  and its effects  on system  
comparisons  the total  premia  per acre  from  the weanling  to beef  systems  in 1996  
amounts  to £189,  £110 and £130 for systems  Al, Bl and Cl when only 74% 
of the animals  in system  Al and 40% in system  Cl qualified  for premia  due to 
stocking  rate limitations.  However,  if all animals  were eligible  for premia  then 
the corresponding  total premia  for 1996 would  be £234,  £110 and £326.  The 
higher  premia  payments  could  be achieved  if there were animals  produced  on 
the farm which  are not eligible  for premia  (and are thus not included  in the LU 
calculations)  such as heifers.
Conclusions  !
1. The various  beef premia  have a major  effect  on beef incomes.
2. In  both  suckling  to beef  and weaning  to beef  systems,  inclusion  of the winter  
slaughter  premium  (for animals  slaughtered  between  January  1 and April  
30) results  in higher  incomes  from the 24 month  steer system.
3. Higher  sale prices (or cheaper  weanlings)  have a far greater  effect on 
incomes  from the young  bull system  than from the two steer systems.
4. In both suckling  to beef  systems  and weanling  to beef  systems  the cost per 
kg of carcass  was lower  for the 29 month  than for the 24 month  system,  
although  incomes  were higher  for the latter.  This shows  that in addition  
to production  costs animal  prices  and premia  are important  determinants  
of profitability.
48
5. The spring  slaughter  premium  improves  the profitability  of winter  finishing  
and as a result  leads  to a better  distribution  of slaughterings  throughout  the 
year.  Higher  cattle  prices  in spring  than later  in the year would  have  similar  
effects.

Farm  profile
The farm consists  of 500 acres  (300 adjusted)  in four divisions.  Herding  the 
four divisions  involves  a round  trip of twenty  four miles.  Of the 250 acres in 
the home  farm only 55 acres  can be cut.  This is cut twice;  30 acres  are also cut 
twice  on one of the outside  farms.  Due to the limited  amount  of land suitable  
for cutting  it is important  to graze extra  cattle  in summertime.  This is one of 
the reasons  for opting  for a 2.5 year old cattle system.

A slatted  house  was built  on the farm in 1978. A slatted  house  for cows  on 
the home  farm and a slatted  cattle house  on an outside  farm were completed  
by 1988. All cattle  are now housed  on slats.
Over 100 acres  of the home  farm have been  drained  and developed  over  the 
years.
Clare  Leader  now proposes  to fund a pilot project  proposed  by Clare  Marts  
to improve  the quality  of cows and bulls in suckler  herds.
I believe  that beef now has to be produced  for the real markets  and that 
intervention  specification  should  not influence  anyone  when planning  their  
longterm  breeding  programme.  We have  already  seen  Intervention  become  less 
attractive  to factories  and I expect  we will have little or no meat going  to this 
outlet  in a few years time. My programme  is planned  to produce  very large  
lean animals  that will give carcase  weights  of 440 - 500 kg and Grade  U.
Niche  Market
With  the very high price  of top quality  calves  and weanlings  it makes  sense  
to carry  them  to high weights  provided  they have  the potential  to do this without  
getting  too fat. I have got a premium  for this type of animal  over the last few 
years. The market  for heavy Lf Grade  carcases  is a niche market  and will 
probably  remain  so but I believe  that there will be a market  for animals  that 
produce  large quantities  of good quality  uniform  lean meat.
Seasonality
Due to my farm structure  much  of my production  is geared  towards  autumn 
slaughtering.  This has been very satisfactory  in the past when  intervention  was
50
open ended  and provided  an outlet  for all the beef  that came  on the market.  I 
now think that I will have to plan to spread  my slaughtering  over the year or 
at least move it away from the autumn  glut.
Development  of suckler  enterprise
In the mid-eighties  I had 30 suckler  cows;  mainly  Hereford  X with a few 
Angus  X and Continental  X. These  were  crossed  with a Simmental  bull. I also 
reared  30 calves  and bought  in about 100 stores  each year. At that stage  the 
calves  were Hereford  X, Friesian  and Continental  X. These  were satisfactory  
but the declining  quality  and high  prices  of the calves  available  and the demand  
for higher  quality  in the market  place  pushed  me into  breeding  more  of my own  
cattle.
The numbers  were increased  by buying  in some Angus  heifer  calves  and 
Angus  breeding  heifers.  These  were  crossed  with  a good  Simmental  bull (except  
for first calvers).  The best heifers  from this herd were kept for breeding.
Two herds
I now have two herds.  The old Hereford  X and  Angus  X herd now produces  
replacements  for the main herd. This herd is grazed  on a wet peaty  area of the 
farm.
The main herd consists  almost  completely  of Simmental  X cows  bred on the 
farm.  These  are crossed  with a large  muscular  Charolais  bull specially  selected  
to breed  large  fast growing  cattle  with  good  conformation.  This  herd  is still being  
expanded.
Calving  difficulty
In spring  of 1992 the first Charolais  calves  were born. The cows had been 
on high  quality  silage  with  little or no rationing.  The calves  were  very large and 
we had many difficult  calvings  with five losses.
In 1993 silage  quality  was poorer  and some moderate  quality  hay was also 
fed. The feed was also rationed.  The result  was that only one calf was lost at 
calving  from 50 calvings.
Plans  for the future
The final size of the cow herd will depend  on the price of store cattle  over 
the next  few years.  I would  not rule out buying  quota  to keep extra  cows.  More  
buildings  will be required  if the cow herd is increased.
There  is also more reclamation  to be carried  out.
I expect  to get the bullocks  now coming  from the Charolais  bull to reach  
850 kg at 2.5 years and the heifers  up to 650 kg at 2 years.

in Scotland

Introduction
Beef  from the suckler  herd accounts  for two-thirds  of overall  Scottish  beef 
production,  unlike  the UK where  suckler  herds account  for only one-third  of 
beef  supplies.  The importance  of the suckler  herd  in Scotland  may  partly  explain  
the reputation  Scotch  beef has developed  as a quality  product  in overseas  
markets.  Certainly  the export  of prime  Scottish  beef plays a significant  part 
in maintaining  higher  prices  for finished  cattle  in Scotland  compared  with the 
rest of the UK. In addition,  the recent  increase  in exports  has revived  competi ­
tiveness  in the Scottish  beef market  which  previously  was increasingly  being  
dominated  by the five main UK supermarkets.
Two aspects  have been important  in successfully  marketing  Scottish  beef. 
First  its perceived  high  eating  quality  - beef  with  excellent  eating  quality  is never  
expensive  whatever  it costs. The second  has been the "naturalness  and whole ­
someness"  of Scottish  beef  - suckled  calf production  being  based  in the scenic  
Scottish  hills and uplands  and recently  reinforced  with the introduction  of a 
Scottish  Farm Assured  Scheme  - FASL.
The general  specification  for Scotch  beef exports  is :
* steers  or heifers
* under  30 months  of age
* 280-340  kg carcass  weight
* carcass  conformation  R or better
* fat class 4L
The  overall  philosophy  in exporting  Scotch  beef  has been  to provide  a unique,  
labelled,  top quality  product  which  cannot  be provided  elsewhere,  rather  than 
the conventional  approach  of exporting  a product  which  other  countries  already  
produce  themselves.
To meet  these  specifications,  particularly  in terms  of high eating  quality  and 
good  conformation,  even  well  bred  suckled  calves  must  remain  healthy  through ­
out their life. For the suckled  calf  the most  common  cause  of ill health  occurs  
post weaning,  particularly  infectious  diseases  such as pneumonia.
Trials  monitoring  the effect  of pneumonia  in an intensive  bull beef system  
show that as well as reducing  lifetime  performance,  i.e. growth  rate and food 
conversion,  pneumonia  has an equally  expensive  effect  in reducing  eventual  
carcass  conformation.
The weaning  check
After  birth,  weaning  is the next most  traumatic  day in the life of the suckled  
calf. In many cases all aspects  of the calfs life changes  completely  in a few
52
short  hours  - its diet, its environment  and its social contacts!  As a  consequence  
most  calves,  if they are lucky  , lose 1-2 months  performance  and the ones who 
aie unlucky get pneumonia!  Fortunately,  careful  management  around  weaning  
can minimise  the weaning  check,  maintain  calf performance  and minimse  the 
risk of pneumonia  with benefits  in the eventual  quality  of the carcass  they 
produce.
As with any disease,  the two important  aspects  to consider  with pneumonia  
are the resistance  of the animal  and the level of infection  to which  it is exposed.  
Effectively,  this simply  means minimising  the weaning  check. Important  
management  points  to consider  are;
1. Age at weaning.  The older/heavier  the calf is at weaning  the less the 
weaning  check  will be.
For example,  for calves  growing  at 1 kg/head/day,  at 3 months  of age the 
calf might  be drinking  9 kg of milk/day  which  would  represent  65% of its 
total energy  intake. In comparison  a 9 month  old calf might only be 
receiving  4 kg of milk/day  equivalent  to only  20% of its total daily  energy  
intake. As a general  rule of thumb  calves  should  NOT he weaned  until 
they are over 5 months  old or over 200 kg liveweight.
2. The importance  of milk. Milk is a unique  feed  for the calf, going  directly  
into its own  "special  stomach"  the abomasum.  All other  feed goes into the  
main stomach  - the rumen. Hence  the more milk calves  are drinking  pre 
weaning,  the less normal  feed (grass,  concentrates,  etc.) they have to eat 
to maintain  liveweight  gains  of around  1 kg/day and  the smaller  their  rumen  
capacity.  As a consequence  the day after  the calf is weaned  its feed intake  
is limited  by its restricted  rumen  capacity  so that in many cases energy  
intakes  are only  sufficient  to maintain  the calf with no energy  available  for 
growth.  Research  shows  that in general  it can take up to about  2 months  
for the rumen  to expand  sufficiently  for weaned  calves  to have normal  dry 
matter  intakes.
The way to overcome  the initial low intake  of weaned  suckled  calves  is 
to feed  a ration  with  a high  energy  concentration  immediately  post  weaning.  
As a general  rule  of thumb,  for weaned  spring  born  calves  wintered  on silage  
rations,  a minimum  of I'h kg of concentrates/head/day  should  be fed post 
weaning.
As the dry matter  intake  of the calf increases  during  the 3 months  after  
weaning  the energy  concentration  of the ration  can gradually  be reduced,  
e.g. concentrate  supplementation  gradually  reduced  to around  only 1 kg/ 
head/day  and still maintain  liveweight  gain. In many  situations  this high/  
low level of concentrate  feeding  results in similar  overall  concentrate  
intakes  over the winter  but can improve  total winter  gains by around  30 
kg/head.
3. Creep  feeding  pre weaning.  Abrupt  weaning  and housing  of spring  born 
suckled  calves  means  a complete  change  in their diet - pre weaning  they 
will be receiving  milk  and grass  and post weaning  silage  and possibly  some  
concentrates.  This abrupt  change  is a major  stress to the calf - it has to
53
4.find where  the new feed is "hidden",  has to get accustomed  to eating  the 
new feeds  as do the bugs in its rumen  which  research  work has  shown  will 
take 2 to 3 weeks  to adjust  fully to the new diet. This stress  is made  worse  
with calves  likely  to be short of feed (grass)  pre weaning.
Trials  investigating  creep  feeding  spring  born  calves  shows  that introducing  
supplementary  concentrates  approximately  2 months  pre weaning  increases  
calf  weaning  weights  by around  25 kg/head  and improves  overall  perform ­
ance  during  the following  winter  with the calves  having  been acclimatised  
to at least  one of their  subsequent  winter  feeds. Creep  feeding  is therefore  
the basis of a successful  weaning  programme  for spring  born calves.
It also has the advantage  that calves  will regulate  their intake  of creep  
depending  on grass supplies  - if adequate  grass (a target  grass height  of 9 
cm) is available  calves  will graze  rather  than eat creep.
Clipping  the backs  of weaned  calves. In the autumn  cattle  begin  to grow  
their  winter  coat, yet the majority  of weaned  calves  will be housed  indoors  
over  the winter.  In this situation  the biggest  problem  facing  cattle  is keeping  
cool, not keeping  warm!
Cattle  like humans,  control  their  body  temperature  by sweating,  particularly  
along  their back. However  with a full winter  coat it is difficult  for sweat  
to evaporate  so that body temperatures  rise, again stressing  the animal. 
Simply  clipping  the back  of weaned  calves  at housing  enables  them  to sweat  
freely  and hence  maintain  a more constant  body temperature,  helping  to 
minimise  the risk of pneumonia.
Trials  in the north of Scotland  showed  that simply  clipping  the backs  of 
weaned  calves  increased  overall  winter  gains by 7 kg/head.
Reducing  the infection  to which  the weaned  calf is exposed
1. Reducing  relative  humidity
Most of the pneumonia-causing  organisms  are airborne  so that animals  
become  infected  by breathing  in the organisms.  Hence  how long these  
organisms  survive  in the air will determine  the level of infection  animals  
breathe  in. The moisture  content  of the air is critical  to the survival  of these  
organisms.  Research  work has shown  that in damp  air (relative  humidity  
above  75%) their life-span  is many hours whereas  in a dry atmosphere  
(below  75% relative  humidity)  their life-span  is much  shorter,  in terms  of 
minutes  rather  than hours. This is why pneumonia  is a major  problem  in 
damp,  muggy  weather.
To minimise  the risk of pneumonia  it is therefore  essential  that buildings  
are kept  as dry as possible  and this is the main function  of good  ventilation.  
It is probably  true to say that the majority,  if not all, cattle buildings  are 
under-ventilated.  The principle  to successfully  ventilating  cattle  buildings  
is to get as much  air change  as possible  over  the heads  of the cattle  without  
draughts  occurring  amongst  the cattle. One method  for improving  the 
ventilation  of existing  buildings  which has been successfully  used in 
Scotland  over recent  years has been slotting  of roofs.
54
2. Frequent  bedding
One way of helping  to reduce  moisture  levels  in buildings  soon after  cattle  
are housed  is to bed them frequently.  Hence,  most Scottish  producers  
housing  cattle  in straw  yards  now bed  weaned calves  daily for the first one 
to 2 weeks  after  they are weaned.  Producers  in Northern  Ireland  have  taken  
this a step further  and actually  bed slatted  pens for weaned  calves  for the 
first 2 to 3 weeks  of the winter.
3. Stocking  rates
The level of infection  an animal  faces depends  on how much  infection  is 
being  produced  around  about  it. An animal  housed  by itself  is most  unlikely  
to suffer  from  pneumonia  whereas  animals  heavily  stocked  are most  at risk. 
Ideally  therefore  newly  weaned  calves  should  be housed  at as low a stocking  
rate as possible  - stocking  rates  can gradually  be increased  once  the calves  
are fully settled  down  and have got over the worst  of the weaning  check.  
In slatted  buildings  this could  be reasonably  easily  achieved  by initially  only 
stocking  every  other  pen and utilising  other  sheds,  e.g. buildings  which  will 
eventually  house  dry cows.
It is not only the level of infection  but also the type of infection  to which  
weaned  calves  are exposed  which  influence  the risk of pneumonia.
Pneumonia  organisms  are commonly  found  in all situations  so that during  
the suckling  period  calves  will have  developed  some  resistance  to the organisms  
they have come in contact  with. However  should  they be faced with new 
organisms  to which  they have no resistance  when  they are being  stressed,  i.e. 
post weaning,  then there is a real risk of pneumonia  occurring.  To avoid  this 
occurring  :
1. Don  'tmix  stock  in the same  building.  Ideally  newly  weaned  suckled  calves  
should  be housed  by themselves  in a separate  building.  The exception  to 
this would  be housing  weaned  calves  alongside  the mature  cows who, in 
general,  are reasonably  resistant  to pneumonia  and do not produce  large  
levels  of infection.  The  common  problem  on many  farms  is to house  newly  
weaned  calves  in the same  shed as the "tail end" calves  from the previous  
year. Often  these tail end calves  also had pneumonia  earlier  in their life 
and hence  are an ideal source  of infection  to this year ’s crop of weaned  
calves.
2. Don't  mix with purchased  stock. The other major  risk is mixing  newly 
weaned  homebred  calves  with purchased  stock. In this situation  it will 
almost  be essential  to vaccinate  both purchased  animals  and homebred  
calves. To ensure  the homebred  calves  have developed  full resistance  
before  they are challenged,  it is essential  that the vaccination  programme  
is carried  out pre weaning  at grass.
Conclusions
To successfully  market  beef it is essential  that it has high eating  quality  to 
give maximum  consumer  satisfaction.  An important  component  in achieving  
this objective  is to maintain  a high  health status  throughout  the animal's  lifetime.
Careful  planning  the weaning  programme  can:
55
ensure  that the major  cause  of ill health  in suckled  calves  is avoided,  with 
considerable  benefits,  both to the efficiency  and hence  profitability  of the 
system.
ensuring  a high value  carcass  which  can compete  in terms  of eating  quality  
with the wide range  of other foods available  to the modern  consumer.

Increasing  Reproductive  Efficiency  in 
Suckler  Herds
M. G. DISKIN
Teagasc,  Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam, Co. Galway.
Both the biological  and economic  efficiency  of suckler  herds depend  on 
calving  the cows  at the optimum  time  each  year, on the cow’s reproductive  rate, 
one calf per cow per year and on the rate of gain of the calf. Reproductive  
efficiency  is, clearly,  very important.
In terms  of reproduction  suckler  cows  are distinctly  different  to dairy cows  
in a number  of important  aspects.  Firstly,  the interval  from calving  to the 
resumption  of cycles  or first heat averages  about  60 days for suckler  cows as 
opposed  to about  30 days for dairy cows.  This long interval  from calving  to 
resumption  of cyclicity  has serious  implications  for maintaining  a 365 day 
calving  interval.  Secondly,  because  of the suckling  effect  of the calf  and indeed  
the presence  of the calves,  suckler  cows  display  less intense  signs  of behaviourial  
heat thus making  heat detection  very difficult  for farmers  who use A.I. These  
and other factors  that affect  herd reproductive  performance  are discussed.
Reproductive  targets
The reproductive  targets  for a suckler  herd are: 1) 90% of the cows should  
calve  in 80 days,  2) less than  5% of cows  should  be culled  for reproductive  failure  
and, 3) the calving-to-calving  interval  should  not exceed  365 days. Good  
management  is required  in order  to achieve  these targets.
Areas  for improving  reproductive  efficiency
In suckler  herds  there  are 3 potential  areas  to improve  reproductive  efficiency  
viz., shortening  the interval  from calving  to first heat, 2) improving  heat 
detection  efficiency  and 3) improving  cow conception  rate.
Interval  between  calving  and resumption  of cycles
The interval  from calving  to first heat (post-partum  interval)  largely  deter ­
mines  the likelihood  of cows becoming  pregnant  during  a compact  breeding  
season.  There are a number  of key physiological  factors  resulting  from the 
suckling  effect  of the calf and from interactions  between  the cow and her calf 
that affect  herd reproductive  efficiency.  A better  understanding  of how these  
factors  operate  is being  obtained  from experiments  at Belclare.  The results  of 
experiments  on cows in poor  body  condition  at calving  and on different  levels  
of post-calving  nutrition,  suckling  restriction  and cow-calf  interaction  are 
presented  in Table 1. In these indoor  experiments  suckling  restriction  (once  
daily)  and/or  cow-calf  isolation  were  started  30 days after  calving.  The experi ­
mental  cows were allowed  to be suckled  once per day starting  30 days after  
calving.  When  cyclicity  was resumed  calves  were  returned  to full-time  access.

Restricting  suckling  frequency  while the cows were adjacent  to the other  
cows  and calves  shortened  the post partum  interval  by 15 days (from  78 to 63 
days).  The combination  of restricting  suckling  frequency  and of isolating  the 
cows  from  their  calves  shortened  the post-partum  interval  by 24 days.  In a further  
experiment  with cows  in different  body condition  scores  at calving,  restricted  
suckling  combined  with calf isolation  also significantly  shortened  the post­
partum  interval  (see Table  2) with the greatest  effect  seen in cows that were  
in poor body score (1.75)  at calving.

It is clear  irrespective  of factors  such  as feeding  level  or body  condition  score  
at calving  that the suckling  process  itself  contributes  significantly  to the delay  
in resumption  of cylicity  in suckler  cows.  Furthermore,  there  appears  to be two 
components  to the suckling  effects  1) the direct  stimulus  of the teat or udder  
when the calf suckles  the cow and 2) non-tactile  stimulation  (visual,  auditory  
or olfactory  cues)  from the calf, or indeed  other  calves  or other  adjacent  cows  
being suckled.
58
The other  major  factor  that effects  resumption  of cyclicity  is nutrition  and 
is currently  the major  focus  of the Belclare  programme.  Nutrition,  particularly  
pre-partum,  has important  implications  when cows resume  cyclicity  after 
calving  (see Table 2). In the ad libitum  group,  the cows in the lowest  body  
condition  at calving  had the long intervals  (71 days) compared  with cows in 
moderate  (59 days)  and good  (55 days)  body condition  score.  These  and other  
experiments  clearly  indicate  that  cows  should  cal  ve in a moderate  body  condition  
score  and post-calving  weight  losses  should  be minimised.  Suckler  cows  should  
be body condition  scored  on a regular  basis before  calving  and cows in poor  
condition  or losing  body  condition  should  be selected  out for additional  feeding.
Heat  detection
Nearly  half of all suckler  cows are now bred by A.I. the success  of which  
is dependent  on achieving  both high and accurate  heat  detection  rates.  Because  
the average  duration  of standing  heat is short, at about  9 hours,  and because  
the signs  of heat  are less intense, heat  detection  is more  difficult  in suckler  cows  
than in either  dairy cows or heifers.  Successful  heat detection  requires  firstly  
that the farmer  clearly  recognises  the signs  of heat, and secondly  has a definite  
commitment  to at least  3 heat  checks  daily  for the duration  of the breeding  period.  
These  cheeks  must  be carried  out early  morning  and late evening  because  these  
are the times  of greatest  heat activity.
Signs  of heat
1. Standing  to be mounted  by herd mate or bull is the most definite  sign.
2. Discharge  of clear mucus:  this originates  in the uterus and is a good  
indication  of imminent  heat.
3. Restlessness  and  mounting  behaviour:  signs of restlessness  are character ­
istic of individual  cows that are either  approaching  or are in heat.
4. Swelling  of vulva:  hormonal  changes  associated  with heat cause an in­
creased  blood supply  to the reproductive  organs  which in turn causes  
swelling  and reddening  of the vulva.
5. Hair  loss and  dirt  marks:  as a result  of continuous  mounting  by herd mates,  
the hair on the tailhead  is usually  removed  and the skin on either  side of 
the tail-head  is often scarred  and dirty.
6. Blood  stains  on the tail or vulval  area are indicative  of a recent  heat.
Techniques  which  may  be of assistance  to improve  heat  detection  efficiency  
Tail-painting:  This works  well in dairy  cows  but is more  variable  in suckler  
cows.  Due to the lower  intensity  of heat activity  there  is less complete  removal  
of paint.
Teaser:  Active,  vasectomized  or teaser  bulls  can be useful  in identifying  cows  
either  coming  into  or on heat. However,  there  is considerable  variation  in libido  
among  bulls and they require  the same management  as full bulls without  any 
of the advantages.
59
Steers:  Steers,  particularly  if recently  castrated,  can be useful  in identifying  
cows coming  into or on heat.
Calf  removal:  The presence  of the calf  reduces  the intensity  of heat as well 
as delaying  the onset  of cycles.  Restricting  suckling  frequency  to either  once  
or twice  per day for a period  of 14 to 20 days may be an option  to both initiate  
cyclicity  and increase  the signs of heat activity  thus facilitating  detection  and 
the A.I. of a higher  proportion  of cows early in the season.  This may not be 
readily  practical  but in acute situations  for example  with late calving  cows,  
young  cows  or with  cows  in poor  body  condition  at calving  this may  be an option  
worth  considering.  Wliere  this approach  is contemplated,  to either  hasten  the 
onset  of cyclicity  or to improve  the behavioral  signs of heat, cows should  be 
separated  not only from their own calves  but also from other cows and their  
calves.
Heat  synchronisation
Control  of the cycle,  or synchronisation  as it is popularly  known,  combined  
with fixed time A.I. can reduce  the amount  of heat checking,  allow  A.I. at a 
preplanned  time and induce  earlier  resumption  of cycles  after calving.  There  
are two categories  of synchronisation  treatment.
1) Prostaglandins:  These  are only effective  in cyclic  cows  and are incapable  
of inducing  cyclicity.  Because  a high  proportion  of suckler  cows  are likely  
to be non-cyclic  prostaglandin  treatment  is not recommended.
2) Progestagens:  PRIDs  (Sanofi)  and Crestar  ear implants  (Intervet))  are 
capable  of inducing  cyclicity  in a proportion  of cows as well as synchro ­
nising  heat and are the treatments  of choice  for suckler  cows.
Advantages  of synchronisation  in breeding  management
Synchronisation  has certain  benefits  in tenns  of shortening  the calving-to-  
conception  interval,  achieving  more  compact  calving,  reducing  the amount  of 
heat detection  and facilitating  A.I. thus giving  access  to proven  sires.
Shortening  the calving-to-conception  interval:  In herds with a seasonal  
calving  pattern  late calving  cows do not have sufficient  time and opportunity  
to become  pregnant  within  a restricted  breeding  season.  Because  of this, more  
late calving  than  early  calving  cows  are culled  for infertility.  Treating  individual  
late calving  cows with a progestagen  (PRID  or Crestar  Implant)  can induce  
ovarian  cyclicity  and reduce  the calving-to-service  and conception  intervals.  
Late calvers  can be treated  with a PRID  or Crestar  implant  from Day 30 after 
calving  to allow  A.I. from 41 days after calving.  While  the conception  rate at 
this early stage post-partum  is low, nevertheless  it still leaves  2 further  repeat  
opportunities  for successful  A.I. within  an 83-day  period,  the time required  for 
the cow to calve within 12 months.  This would  reduce  the culling  rate for 
apparent  infertility.  In herds already  using A.I. individual  cows not observed  
in heat,  due to missed  heat  or true anoestrum,  may be treated  with  either  a PRID  
or Crestar  implant.
Compact  calving:  One of the potential  benefits  envisaged  initially  was
60
synchronisation  of groups  of cows,  particularly  in herds  with  a scattered  calving  
pattern.  Because  cows  should  be calved  35 days  before  treatment  the proportion  
of cows  available  on any given  day is restricted  necessitating  the treatment  of 
groups  of cows at intervals.  Thus,  where  the requirement  is greatest,  the role 
for synchronisation  is least effective.
Reducing  the amount  of  heat  detection:  Inability  to accurately  detect  a high 
proportion  of cows in heat leads to disappointing  conception  rates and to the 
use of A.I. for a longer  period  than  should  be necessary.  If efficient  heat  detection  
is not possible  an alternative  strategy  would  be to synchronise  all cows  calved  
at least 35 days at the start of the breeding  period  which  would  allow fixed-  
time A.I. without  reference  to heat. Most of the repeat  heats would  fall over 
a confined  period,  facilitating  heat detection.  However,  as already  indicated,  
if detection  of repeats  is poor any advantage  will be easily  lost. An alternative  
strategy  would  be to introduce  a bull to cover  late and repeat  heats.  However,  
for a  small  number  of cows  the economics  of such a system  would  be doubtful.
Disadvantages  of synchronisation
1) It is important  to realise that treatment  for oestrous  cycle control  
necessitates  assembly  of animals  up to four  times,  viz., for progestagen  insertion  
and removal  or for two prostaglandin  injections  and again  for two fixed-time  
A.I.s. This requires  good basic cattle handling  facilities.
2) Both  Crestar  ear implants  and PRIDs  cost approximately  £8-10  per cow  
treated  plus a veterinary  call fee. The actual  cost may depend  on the number  
of cows to be synchronised.
3) Where  reproductive  efficiency  is already  low because  of underlying  causes  
such  as poor  nutrition,  synchronisation  treatments  will not improve  fertility  until 
the underlying  causes  are corrected.  Synchronisation  treatments  are only suc­
cessful  when used with good management.  They must always  be considered  
as an aid and never  as a substitute  for good breeding  management.
Factors  affecting  conception  rate
Even when heat detection  and A.I. are properly  carried  out, a significant  
amount  of reproductive  wastage  still occurs.  On average  only 55%-60%  of 
inseminations  (natural  or artificial)  result  in the birth  of a calf. This low calving  
rate is seldom  caused  by fertilisation,  rather  is due to death of the embryo  at 
a later  stage. When  embryo  death  occurs  before  the time  of maternal  recognition  
of pregnancy  at days 16-17  after breeding  the cow repeats  at between  18 and 
24 days after breeding.  However,  when  death  of the embryo  occurs  later than 
16 or 17 days  after  breeding,  repeat  occur  at long  and irregular  intervals.  Between  
days 50 days and 8 months  after  breeding  the incidence  of foetal  loss is about  
5-8%.
A number  of factors  are known  to affect  calving  rate including  calving-to-  
service  interval,  accuracy  of heat detection,  level of nutrition  and many  others.
Calving-to-service  interval:  Calving  rate reaches  a normal 60%  in cows  bred 
at 60 or more  days after calving.  When  cows are bred at 40 days or less after
61
calving  or indeed  at their  first post-calving  heat conception  rate is as low as 20-  
40%.  Clearly,  it is essential  that cows  return  to cyclicity  as quickly  as possible  
after calving  in order  to be inseminated  at their second  or subsequent  insemi ­
nation.
Heat  detection  accuracy:  Unless  the cow submitted  for A.I. is in “true” heat 
there is no chance  of conception.  Accuracy  of heat detection  is a problem  in 
herds.  Even in some  dairy  herds  up to 20% of cows submitted  for A.I. are not 
in “true” heat.
Timing  of  A.I: Calving  rate is highest  following  A.I. at 12-18 hours  after  
heat onset  but not greatly  reduced  following  early A.I. However,  A.I. (e.g.,  24 
hours  after onset  of standing  heat) should  be avoided.
Calving  difficulty:  Besides  its effects  on cow and calf mortality  calving  
difficulty  also decreases  rebreeding  performance.  As the severity  of calving  
difficulty  increases  conception  rate decreases.  This  reduction  in conception  rate 
is due to abnormalities  arising  from  calving  difficulty,  including  delayed  uterine  
involution  and increased  infection,  damage  to the tract and the development  of 
uterine  and ovarian  adhesions.  Therefore,  calving  difficulty  should  be mini ­
mised.  Two factors  that greatly  affect  the incidence  of calving  difficulty  are 
cow's  age and calf sire. The incidence  of calving  difficulty  is 4-8 times  higher  
in first calvers  than in mature  cows and about  twice  as high in second  calvers  
than in mature  cows. Breed  of sire and indeed  sire within  a breed should  be 
carefully  selected  for use on heifers  and young  cows. Cows with a uterine  
infection  should  be treated  at an early stage.
Minerals:  Mineral  deficiencies  and imbalances  are frequently  implicated  as 
a likely  cause  of low conception  rate. However,  scientific  data to substantiate  
this claim  is lacking.  Because  of the low cost of mineral  supplements  it is best 
to supplement  cows during  the dry period  by feeding  a pre-calving  mineral  
supplement  and after calving  a post-calving  mineral  supplement.  Any further  
supplementation  should  be based  on blood,  herbage/feed  and soil analysis.
Season:  A drop of conception  is frequently  seen in dairy herds and in a 
proportion  of suckler  herds following  turn-out  in spring.  This may be related  
to excessive  intakes  of rumen-degradable  protein,  the level of which  is high in 
spring  grass. On-going  Teagasc  experiments  at Belclare  suggest  that the feeding  
of 0.75 kg of fishmeal,  to cows on spring  pasture,  improves  conception  rate.
CoH ’ age: While  heifers  acquire  the ability  to reproduce  once they reach  
puberty,  calving  rate is as low as 20-30%  following  breeding  at the first  or second  
heats  and only reaches  a normal  level (60%)  at the third and subsequent  heats. 
Replacement  heifers  should  be well grown  and regularly  cyclic  before  the start 
of the breeding  season.  Between  5 and 15% of heifers  may have genetic  or 
anatomical  abnormalities  which  prevent  conception.
When heifers  calve as 2-year  olds their post-calving  conception  rates are 
lower  compared  with mature  cows.  This is a reflection  of the increased  demands  
on the young  cow at this time to support  maintenance,  lactation,  growth  and 
reproduction;  hence  the need to have replacements  well grown  at the time of
62
first calving.  Similarly,  old cows nearing  the end of their productive  life tend 
to have a lower  level of fertility.
A.I. vs natural service:  If heat is accurate  and A.I. timed  and carried  out 
correctly,  conception  rate is similar  following  A.I. or natural  service.
Bull  fertility:  Natural  service  bulls can have a major  impact  on pregnancy  
rate and calving  spread.  Unfortunately,  a bull’s infertility  is not usually  discov ­
ered  until  at least  one repeat  interval  has elapsed  since  joining  the herd.  In Ireland  
there is no documented  information  on the fertility  of bulls in natural  service  
but U.K and American  data indicate  that 3-5%  of bulls  are completely  infertile  
and a further  30% are “unsatisfactory ” in terms of semen  quality,  abnormalities  
of the penis and libido.
A veterinary  examination  combined  with a semen  evaluation  one month  
before  the start of the breeding  season  identifies  the majority  of infertile  bulls  
though  not sub-fertile  bulls.  A bull may not remain  fertile  throughout  all of his 
working  life or indeed  throughout  a single  breeding  season.
During  the breeding  season  the farmer  should  check  cows regularly  for 
repeats  and also to check  bulls periodically  for serving  ability.  Where  a bull 
is expected  to serve  a large herd of cows (>50)  it is important  that the bull is 
active  and has a  high  libido.  Because  bulls  vary in libido,  semen  production  and 
mating  ability,  it is difficult  to be precise  about  cow to bull ratio. However,  a 
mature  bull will  generally  cover  up to 40 cows  and a yearling  bull up to 25 cows.
Herd replacements
To avoid  delayed  resumption  of cycles  after  first their  first  calving,  replace ­
ments  should  be 350-t- kg at mating  and 550 kg at calving.  Heifers  should  be 
bred to an easy calving  sire, and should  be bred to calve early in the season.  
Late calving  heifers  will on average  be late calving  cows.

Relative  Tissue Growth  Patterns  and 
Carcass  Composition  in Beef Cattle
M. G. KEANE
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
The main  objective  of the beef  breed  evaluation  programme  which  has been  
carried  out at Grange  Research  Centre  over the past number  of years  has been  
to evaluate  all the common  breed  types  under  Irish condition.  The programme  
was designed  primarily  to provide  information  on the productive  characteristics  
of the different  beef  crosses  out of Friesian  cows  but in the course  of the work  
much  additional  information  was also acquired  on growth  patterns  of body  parts  
and tissues  and how they determine  body composition.
Cattle  can be categorised  into 3 main breed  types:  (1) early maturing  types  
such as the Angus  and Hereford  and their crosses,  (2) dairy types such as the 
Friesian,  Holstein  and Meuse-Rhine  Issel (MRI),  and (3) late maturing  or 
continental  breed  types  such as Limousin,  Blonde  D’Aquitaine,  Charolais  and 
their crosses.  Throughout  this paper the results  from an experiment  which  
compared  Friesians  (dairy  type),  Hereford  x Friesians  (early maturing  type)  and 
Charolais  x Friesians  (late maturing  type)  will be used to indicate  or represent  
the differences  between  these three categories.  The subject  matter  will be 
discussed  under  the following  headings:  (1) non-carcass  parts and kill-out,  (2) 
carcass  physical  composition,  (3) muscle  chemical  composition,  (4) sex type 
and dairy breed  type in relation  to carcass  composition  and classification,  and 
(5) carcass  classification  as an indicator  of carcass  composition. ,
Non-carcass  parts  and kill-out
The non-carcass  parts of beef cattle  are sources  of food and industrial  raw 
materials  in their own right, but the main interest  in them by beef producers  
is in how they influence  killing  out proportion  since this determines  carcass  
weight  on which  payment  is based.  The mean weights  and proportions  of the 
non-carcass  parts for Friesian,  Hereford  x Friesian  and Charolais  x Friesian  
steers  are shown  in Table 1. Taken  together,  transport  weight  loss and weight  
of rumen  contents  ranged  from 99 g/kg for the Charolais  crosses  to 110 g/kg 
for the Friesians.  The higher  value  for the Friesians  over the beef  crosses  was 
due to their  greater  feed intake  and consequently  their  greater  weight  of rumen  
and intestinal  contents.  Thus,  as aproportion  of full liveweight,  empty  liveweight  
ranged  from 890 g/kg for the Friesians  to 901 g/kg for the Charolais  crosses.  
Gastro  intestinal  tract (rumen,  reticulum  and abomasum  empty  plus omasum  
and intestines  with  contents)  as a proportion  of empty  bodyweight  ranged  from  
99 g/kg for the Hereford  crosses  to 110 g/kg for the Friesians,  the higher  value 
for Friesians  being  again  a function  of their  higher  intake  capacity.  Hide,  head  
and feet combined,  ranged  from 124 g/kg for Friesians  to 139 g/kg  for Hereford  
crosses,  the higher  value  for Herefords  being  due  to their  greater  hide  proportion.

to 99 g/kg for Friesians,  94 g/kg for Hereford  crosses  and 95 g/kg for Charolais  
crosses.  The higher  value for the Friesians  reflects  the potential  of this dairy  
breed  for higher  metabolic  turnover.  Trimmed  fats (kidney,  channel,  caul, cod 
and topside)  amounted  to 68 g/kg for Friesians,  62 g/kg for Hereford  crosses  
and 55 g/kg for Charolais  crosses.  The higher  value for the Friesians  is in 
agreement  with the known  greater  deposition  of internal  fats in dairy than in 
beef  breeds  and the higher  value  for Hereford  than Charolais  crosses  is in line 
with the generally  greater  fatness  of the Hereford  than the Charolais  breed.
As proportions  of empty  bodyweight,  all the non-carcass  parts (plus chill 
weight  loss) amounted  to 412 g/kg for Friesians,  406 g/kg  for Hereford  crosses  
and 398 g/kg for Charolais  crosses.  This left carcass  weight  (cold)  at 588, 594 
and 602 g/kg for the three  breed  types,  respectively.  Based  on slaughter  weight,  
the conventional  kill-out  proportions  were 533, 543 and 553 g/kg for the 
Friesians;  Hereford  and Charolais  crosses,  respectively.  Thus, at  approximately  
the same liveweight  (570 kg), the cold carcass  weights  for Friesian,  Hereford  
and Charolais  crosses  would  be 304, 310 and 315 kg, respectively.

types  would  be slaughtered  at different  weights  and slaughter  weight  affects  the 
proportions  of non-carcass  parts and consequently  kill-out  proportion.  Thus,  
carcass  weights  and kill-out  proportions  were calculated  for three different  
slaughter  weights  for each  of the breed  types  (Table  2). The  thre^  weights  chosen  
were 500, 600 and 700 kg, empty  bodyweight.  These  gave slaughter  weights  
which  were similar  for the Hereford  and Charolais  crosses,  but which  were  
somewhat  higher  for Friesians  because  of their greater  gastro-intestinal  tract 
contents.  Over  the range  500 to 700 kg empty  bodyweight,  kill-out  proportion  
increased  by about  20 g/kg for all three breed  types.  At a slaughter  weight  of 
about 670 kg, carcass  weights  were 359, 368 and 373 kg for the Friesians,  
Hereford  and Charolais  crosses,  respectively.  Corresponding  carcass  weights  
at slaughter  weights  of about  770 kg were  420, 430 and 435 kg, respectively.  
In brief, the kill-out  proportion  of Hereford  crosses  was about 10 g/kg higher  
than that of Friesians  and the kill-out  proportion  of Charolais  crosses  was about  
10 g/kg higher  than that of Hereford  crosses.  Kill-out  increased  by about 10 
g/kg  for each 100 kg increase  in slaughter  weight  and this was reasonably  similar  
for the different  breed  types.
Carcass  composition
Carcass  composition  is defined  as the proportions  of fat, muscle,  bone and 
other tissue in the carcass.  Other tissue includes  tendons,  ligaments,  fascia,  
glands  and large blood vessels  and is generally  included  with bone in the 
presentation  of compositional  data. Fat is generally  partitioned  into the subcu ­
taneous  and intermuscular  depots.  Subcutaneous  fat is that which  is visible  and 
overlies  the muscle  on the surface  of the carcass.  Intermuscular  fat comprises  
the seams  of separable  fat lying  beneath  and between  the muscles.  It should  not 
be confused  with intramuscular  fat or marbling  fat which  is the fat between  the 
muscle  fibres within the muscle.  This can only be quantified  by chemical  
analysis  and is then defined  as lipid.
Carcass  composition  changes  continuously  with increasing  weight.  Conse ­
quently  a single  point  estimate  of composition  at a particular  carcass  weight  is
66
of little value  because  it gives no information  on what composition  would  be 
at a different  carcass  weight.  Therefore,  what  is required  is measurement  of the 
growth  rates  of the different  tissues.  This  then permits  estimation  of the weights  
(and hence  the proportions)  of the different  tissues  at any carcass  weight.  Based  
on such tissue growth  measurements,  the proportions  of subcutaneous  fat, 
intermuscular  fat, bone (including  “other tissue ”) and muscle  were estimated  
for all the common  breed  types  at 280,340  and  400 kg carcass  weight.  The  results  
are shown  in Table  3. At 280 kg carcass  weight,  Friesians  had about 18% fat, 
20% bone and 62% muscle.  Corresponding  proportions  were 20%, 19% and 
61% for Hereford  crosses,  15%, 19% and 66% for Limousin  crosses,  14%, 19% 
and 67%  for Charolais  crosses  and 13%, 19% and 68%  for Belgian  Blue  crosses.  
Thus, at the same carcass  weight,  muscle  proportion  ranged  from 61% for 
Herefords  to 68% for Belgian  Blue crosses.  As carcass  weight  increased,  
proportions  of fat increased  and proportions  of muscle  and bone decreased.  
Compared  with at 280 kg, at 400 kg carcass  weight,  fat had increased  by 9% 
and bone and muscle  had decreased  by 3% and 6%, respectively  in Friesians.  
Corresponding  changes  were 11%, 3% and 8% for Hereford  crosses,  7%, 3% 
and 4% for Charolais  crosses  and 7%, 4% and 3% for Belgian  Blue crosses.
The  changes  in fat and muscle  proportions  per 10 kg change  in carcass  weight  
are shown  in Table  4. Rates  of fat change  varied  from 8.2 g per 10 kg carcass  
weight  for Hereford  crosses  to 5.5 g per 10 kg carcass  weight  for Belgian  Blue  
crosses.  Rates  of muscle  change  were lower  and varied  from  -6.3 for Hereford  
crosses  to -2.4 for Belgian  Blue  crosses.  Weights  at similar  total carcass  fatness  
(210  g/kg)  ranged  from 286 kg for Hereford  crosses  to 427  kg for Belgian  Blue  
crosses.  Compared  with Friesians,  Hereford  crosses  were about  30 kg carcass  
lighter  and MRI, Limousin,  Simmental,  Charolais,  Blonde  d’Aquitaine  and 
Belgian  Blue crosses  were about 10, 40, 60, 90, 100 and 110 kg heavier,  
respectively  at the same  carcass  fat proportion.  Muscle  proportion  at constant  
fatness was similar for Friesians,  Hereford  and MRI crosses,  and was

approximately  20, 30, 30, 40 and 50 g/kg higher  for Simmental,  Limousin,  
Blonde  d’Aquitaine,  Charolais  and Belgian  Blue crosses,  respectively.  Thus,  
even at constant  carcass  fatness  the continental  crosses  had a higher  proportion  
of muscle.
As well as differing  in the proportions  of tissues  in the carcass,  breeds  also 
differ in the distribution  of tissues  across  the carcass,  and this distribution  
changes  with  changes  in carcass  weight.  The distribution  of muscle  in the main  
carcass  joints for the three contrasting  breed types (Friesians,  Hereford  x 
Friesians  and Charolais  x Friesians)  at three  muscle  weights  is shown  in Table  
5. The carcass  weights  at which  these  muscle  weights occurred  are also shown. 
At any muscle  weight,  Hereford  crosses  had a lower  proportion  of muscle  in 
the hind limb and higher  proportions  in the flank and ribs than Friesians.  
Charolais  crosses  had a higher  proportion  of muscle  in the hind  limb  and thorax  
and lower  proportions  in the flank  and fore  limb  than  both  Friesians  and Hereford  
crosses.  Overall,  the breeds  did not differ  greatly  in the proportions  of muscle  
in the fore- and hindquarters.  There  were some differences  in the proportions  
of muscle  in the higher  value  joints with the Charolais  crosses  having  more  
muscle  than  Herefords  which  had “good ” conformation.  Of course  the Charolais  
crosses  which  also had “good ” conformation  did have a higher  proportion  of 
higher  value muscle.  On average  the proportion  of higher  value muscle  de­
creased  by 2.67 g per 10 kg increase  in muscle  weight.  Again,  conformation  
improved  with  increasing  (muscle)  weight,  but as already shown,  the proportion  
of higher  value muscle  declined.  In brief therefore,  there were differences  
between  breeds  in muscle  distribution  although  such differences  were small. 
Continental  type  cattle  had more  high  value  muscle  than Friesians  which  in turn 
had more high value muscle  than early maturing  breed types.  Proportions  of 
muscle  in the higher  value  joints  and in the hindquarter  decreased  with  increasing  
carcass  and muscle  weight.

Chemical  composition  of muscle
The chemical  constituents  of muscle  are moisture,  protein,  lipid (intramus ­
cular fat) and ash. Ash usually  amounts  to only about 10 g/kg and is smaller  
than the error  involved  in determining  the other  constituents.  Consequently,  it 
is generally  not measured  and is assumed  at 10 g/kg. The mean composition  
of muscle  is about  720 g/kg moisture,  220 g/kg protein,  50 g/kg lipid and 10 
g/kg ash. However,  as shown  in Table  6, the chemical  composition  of muscle  
is not constant  but varies  between  joints  across  the carcass.  In general,  protein  
proportion  remains  reasonably  constant  but lipid and moisture  proportions  vary 
inversely  with each other.
As is clear from Table 6, the hind limb and /. dorsi had the lowest  lipid 
concentrations  followed  by the fore limb and loin. The flank and thorax  had 
lipid values  almost  double  those  in the hind limb and /. dorsi and the ribs had 
the highest  lipid concentration.  The latter  high value may reflect  the fact that 
complete  separation  of the muscle  and intermuscular  fat is almost  impossible  
in the ribs. Consequently,  the high lipid value  for the ribs may be due to some  
separable  fat remaining  attached  to the muscle.  In brief, it is clear  that muscle  
lipid concentration  can vary from being very low to being quite high.
As with  physical  composition,  chemical  composition  also varies with  weight  
and breed type. The estimated  mean chemical  composition  of the 1. dorsi at 
three carcass  weights  is shown  in Table 7 for the main breed types. Lipid

concentration  varied  from as low as 16 g/kg for Blonde  d’Aquitaine,  Belgian  
Blue and Charolais  steers at 280 kg carcass  weight  to as high as 77 g/kg for 
Hereford  x Friesian  steers  at 4(X) kg carcass  weight.  Some  continental  crosses  
had similar  lipid concentrations  at 340 kg carcass  weight  to Hereford  crosses  
at 280 kg carcass  weight.  Similarly,  Charolais  and Belgian  Blue (or Blonde)  
crosses  at 400 kg carcass  weight  had similar  lipid concentratio'ns  to Friesians  
and Limousin  crosses,  respectively,  at 340 kg carcass  weight.  When  compared  
with data in Tables  3 and 4, it is clear that the differences  in carcass  weight  
between  breeds  at similar  muscle  lipid concentration  are less than at similar  
carcass  fat proportion.  In brief the Hereford  crosses  had the highest  lipid 
concentration  at any weight  followed  by the MRI  crosses  and then the Friesians.  
The Limousin  crosses  had the highest  lipid concentration  of the continentals  
followed  by the Simmental,  Charolais,  Blonde  d’Aquitaine  and Belgian  Blue  
crosses.

Steers  and heifers
Surprisingly,  there  are few reported  comparisons  of carcass  composition  in 
heifers  and steers.  Heifers  are generally  considered  to be inferior  to steers  in 
carcass  composition  and consequently  are often discounted  in price per unit 
carcass  weight.  In Ireland  the reasons  for differences  in price between  heifers  
and steers  has little to do with their respective  real value.  The price of steers  
is determined  by market  supports  such as intervention  and export  refunds  and 
by the prices  prevailing  on export  markets.  There  are no market  supports  for 
heifers  and their price is determined  largely  by conditions  in the domestic  
market.  Therefore,  it cannot  be concluded,  that because  steers  are priced  higher  
than heifers  they are of superior  carcass  composition  and of greater  real value.  
Nevertheless,  heifer  careasses  do grade  poorer  (higher  fat score  and/or  poorer  
conformation  score)  than steer  carcasses  from similar  breed  types  at the same  
age or weight  and because  of this there is the perception  that they are of poor  
quality  and lower  value  overall.
The data in Table  8 are from  a comparison  of Hereford  x Friesian  steers  and 
heifers  which  were  reared  together  from  calfhood  to slaughter.  The heifers  were  
serially  slaughtered  to ensure  that they  covered  the range  of fatness  of the steers.  
Slaughter  groups  of heifers  were  then  picked  which  had approximately  the same  
carcass  composition  as the steers.  The steers  were about  60 kg carcass  weight  
heavier  than the heifers.  The heifers  were  about  one half  class  poorer  in carcass  
conformation  than  the steers  and there  was little difference  in carcass  fat score.  
Overall,  composition  between  the two sexes was very similar  with the heifers  
having  slightly  more  bone and muscle  and less fat than the steers.  The heifers  
also had more high value muscle  than the steers. In brief, therefore,  early  
maturing  type heifers  and steers  have similar  proportions  of carcass  fat when  
the heifers  are about 50 kg carcass  weight  lighter  than the steers (the 59 kg

difference  here was excessive  because  fat proportion  was lower  for the heifers  
(204 g/kg)  than for the steers  (213 g/kg)).  The poorer  carcass  conformation  of 
heifers  was accompanied  by a slightly  higher  muscle  proportion  and a consid ­
erably  higher  proportion  of higher  value muscle.
Dairy  breeds
There has been much criticism  from beef interests  of the move towards  
Holsteins  by dairy farmers.  This is mainly  because  the Holsteins  have inferior  
carcass  grades.  As an alternative  to the Friesian-Holstein,  the MRI has been  
proposed  as a suitable  dual purpose  or dairy  breed  because  it has good  carcass  
conformation.  Both  the Holstein  (Holstein  x (Holstein  x Friesian)  and the MRI  
(MRI  X Friesian)  have been evaluated  at Grange  (Table  9). In agreement  with 
much  published  work worldwide,  the Grange  experiments  showed  that even  
though  Holsteins  had considerably  poorer  conformation  than Friesians,  there  
was very little difference  in carcass  composition  between  the two strains.  
However,  the Holsteins  did have a slightly  lower  proportion  of higher  value  
muscle.
In the comparison  between  the Friesians  and MRIs,  the MRIs had much  
superior  carcass  conformation  (0.4 class)  but there were no differences  in the 
proportions  of muscle  or of higher  value muscle.  It is clear  therefore  that in the 
dairy breeds  compared  here there was little relationship  between  carcass  con­
formation  score and the main components  of carcass  composition.

Carcass  classification  and composition
The main purposes  of a carcass  classification  scheme  are (a) to serve as a 
common  language  for the visual  description  of carcasses,  (b) to facilitate  the 
administration  of various  schemes  (i.e. intervention),  and (c) to provide  a basis 
for differential  pricing  of carcasses.  Proponents  and administrators  of carcass  
classification  schemes  do not claim  that such schemes  necessarily  discriminate
72
between  carcasses  of different  muscle  proportions  and muscle  distribution.  The 
classification  schemes  are provided  to describe  traits which  those  involved  in 
trading  and marketing  of beef  carcasses  believe  need  to be described.  However,  
many producers  and many of those involved  in the provision  of technical  
information and  services  to the cattle  and beef  industry believe  that beef  carcass  
classification  does discriminate  between  carcasses  on the basis  of real quality  
and value.
When  the original  Irish  carcass  classification  was established  a large  number  
of carcasses  were boned  out and fat trimmed  to determine  the meat  yields  for 
each  cell of the classification  grid.  Later  when  the common  EC scheme  (EUROP)  
was adopted,  the data  for the Irish  scheme  were  converted  to the EC scale.  These  
are shown  in Table 10. Very few carcasses  occurred  in conformation  class E 
or in fat class 1, so these  classes  have been omitted.  Averaged  across  the four 
fat classes  (2 to 5), mean  meat proportion  declined  from 712 to 662 g/kg or a 
mean decrease  of 16.7 g/kg per class increase  in fatness.  There  was a •trend  
towards  a greater  difference  in meat  proportion  between  fat class  as conforma ­
tion improved.  Averaged  across  the four conformation  classes  (U to P) meat  
yield declined  from 698 to 681 g/kg or a mean decrease  of 5.7 g/kg per 
conformation  class. When  examined  more closely  it is clear that there was 
virtually  no difference  in meat  yield between  conformation  class  “R” and “O” 
and over  75%  of all Irish  steer  carcasses  fall into these  two conformation  classes.  
In brief,  therefore,  the Irish data relating  carcass  classification  to composition  
showed  that fat score was three times as important  as conformation  score in 
determining  the meat  yield  of a carcass  and for the majority  of Irish carcasses  
(conformation  classes  “R” and “O”) conformation  had no significant  influence
on meat yield.  , .
From research  in Great Britain  by the Meat and Livestock  Commission  
(MLC)  and also at Grange  it has become  clear that any relationship  between  
conformation  and composition  depends  on the mix of breed types involved.  
Some  breed  types have both good conformation  and high meat yields  while  
others  have  both poor  conformation  and low meat  yields.  In cattle  populations  
where  only these two distinct  types occur,  then conformation  is closely  asso-

ciated  with meat yield.  In practice  however,  cattle  populations  are comprised  
of a wide  range  of breed  types.  In addition  to the two distinct  types  mentioned  
above  there  are also breed  types  which  have  reasonably  good  conformation  but 
have  rather  low meat  yields  and there  are breed  types  which  have  relatively  poor  
conformation  but have  fairly  high meat  yields.  Thus,  any relationship  between  
conformation  and meat yield depends  on the relative  proportions  of these  
different  breed  types  in the population.  This is evident  from some  recent  results  
from a Grange  experiment  which  compared  Friesians  with Belgian  Blue x 
Friesians  and MRI x Friesians.
The data in Table  11 show  the comparison  by conformation  class  and breed  
type. Belgian  Blue crosses  were predominantly  “R” while Friesians  were  
predominantly  “O”. Muscle  proportions  for the two breed  types/conformation  
classes  were  648 and 593 g/kg,  respectively  while  high  value  muscle  proportions  
were 404 and 394 g/kg, respectively.  Thus, on the basis of this comparison  
between  the Belgian  Blue crosses  (“R”) and the Friesians  (“O”) it would  be 
concluded  that there  was  a big difference  between  the two conformation  classes  
(“R” and “O”) in muscle  proportion  and in high value muscle.
Unlike  the Belgian  Blue crosses  and Friesians  where  each breed type fell 
into a different  conformation  class,  the MRI crosses  fell almost  half and half 
into the same  two classes.  Including  the MRI  crosses  helps  to establish  whether  
the differences  in composition  between  the Belgian  Blue crosses  and the 
Friesians  was due to breed  type or to conformation  class.  There  was essentially  
no difference  between  the “R” and “O” MRIs  in muscle  proportion  and while  
there  was some  difference  in high  value  muscle  proportion  it seems  to have  been  
largely  due to chance  because  the value for the Friesians  was midway  between  
tbe two MRI values.  In brief, if there  had only been Belgian  Blue crosses  and 
Friesians  then there would  have been big differences  in composition  between  
the “R” and “O” conformation  classes,  whereas  if there had only been MRIs,  
there would  have been little or no difference.  Thus,  the differences  in carcass  
composition  between  the conformation  classes  was a function  of the mix of breed  
types involved  and independent  of breed type, conformation  is a poor if not 
worthless  indicator  of carcass  composition,  muscle  distribution  or real carcass  
value.

The proportions  of muscle  and higher  value  muscle  as affected  by fat class  
(for  fat classes  3 and 4) are shown  in Table  12. On average  the difference  between  
the two fat classes  were 25 g/kg muscle  and 2 g/kg higher  value  muscle.  The 
proportion  of higher  value  muscle  would  not be expected  to be influenced  by 
fat class. As with conformation,  there was a breed effect. There was little  
difference  in composition  between  the MRI crosses  and the Friesians  in either  
fat class,  but the Belgian  Blue crosses  had 46 g/kg more muscle  and 10 g/kg 
more high value muscle  in fat class 3 than the mean of the MRI crosses  and 
Friesians.  The corresponding  values  for fat class  4L were 45 g/kg more  muscle  
and 6 g/kg more high value muscle.  In brief, there was an effect  of fat class  
on muscle  proportion  but the difference  between  breeds  within  a fat class was 
greater  than the difference  between  fat classes.
The mean  proportions  of muscle  and higher  value  muscle  together  with the 
ranges  around  these  means  for the four most  important  classification  cells (03, 
04L,  R3, R4L)  are shown  in Table  13. As would  be expected  from  the foregoing  
discussion,  the differences  between  the means  were  not very  large  but the ranges  
around  the means  were very large and overlapped  considerably.  For example,  
the muscle  proportion  in R4L ranged  from 525 to 656 g/kg. This covered  the 
entire  range  found  in 03 (555-621),  practically  the entire  range  found  in 04L 
(521-632)  and most  of the range  in R3 (596-682).  Therefore,  classification  did 
not really  discriminate  between  carcasses  on the basis of muscle  proportion.  
There  was also a very large  range  in proportion  of higher  value  muscle.  Again  
the range  found  in class R4L (371-428)  covered  the entire  ranges  found  in R3 
(378-420)  and 04L (373-421)  and most  of the range  found  in 03 (359-424).  In 
brief,  it is concluded  that carcass  classification  is a very  poor  indicator  of muscle  
proportion  and higher  value muscle  proportion.
While  the foregoing  tables  and discussion  clearly  show that carcass  classi ­
fication  is an unreliable  indicator  of carcass  composition,  it is nevertheless  
necessary  to give statistical  expression  to this. Consequently,  the relevant  
elements  of composition  were  regressed  on fat score  and on conformation  score  
separately  (Table  14). Both  fat proportion  and muscle  proportion  were signifi ­
cantly  related  to fat score.  On average  fat proportion  increased  by 31 g/kg and 
muscle  proportion  decreased  by 25 g/kg per unit increase  in fat class.
However,  while  these relationships  were statistically  significant,  fat score

explained  only one-third  of the variance  in fat proportion  and only one-half  in 
muscle  proportion.
Conformation  score was not significantly  related  to fat proportion,  muscle  
proportion,  high value  muscle  proportion  or muscle  size (/. dorsi  area).  The only 
element  of composition  significantly  related  to conformation  score was bone  
proportion  which  decreased  by 10 g/kg  per unit improvement  in conformation.  
In brief,  it is concluded  that fat score  was significantly  related  to fat and muscle  
proportions  but accounted  for only one-third  to one-half  of the variance.  
Conformation  score  was not significantly  related  to any carcass  trait  except  bone  
proportion  which  declined  with improving  conformation.
Conclusions
1. Carcass  weight  as a proportion  of empty  bodyweight  was 588, 594 and 
602 g/kg for Friesians,  Hereford  x Friesians  and Charolais  x Friesians,  respec ­
tively.  Corresponding  kill-out  proportions  (cold  carcass  weights  as a proportion  
of unfasted  final farm weight)  were  533, 543 and 553 g/kg.  Kill-out  proportion  
increased  by about 10 g/kg per 100 kg increase  in slaughter  weight.
2. As carcass  weight  increased,  the proportions  of bone  and muscle  decreased  
and the proportion  of fat increased,  but the rates of these changes  differed  
between  breed types.

3. Compared  with  Friesians  at 320 kg carcass  weight,  Hereford  crosses  were  
about  30 kg carcass  weight  lighter  at the same carcass  fat proportion.  Corre ­
sponding  differentials  for MRI, Limousin,  Simmental,  Charolais,  Blonde  
d’Aquitaine  and  Belgian  Blue  crosses  were 10,40,60,90,100  and 110 kg carcass  
weight  heavier.
4. Breed  types  differed  in muscle  distribution  across  the carcass.  Continental  
type cattle  had a higher  proportion  of higher  value muscle  than Friesians  and 
early maturing  breed types,  while  Friesians  had a higher  proportion  than the 
early  maturing  types  notwithstanding  the fact  that the latter  had better  conforma ­
tion.
5. Mean  muscle  chemical  composition  was about  720 g/kg moisture,  220 
g/kg protein,  50 g/kg lipid and 10 g/kg ash. Chemical  composition  varied  
between  joints  of the carcass,  lipid concentration  was lowest  for the /. dorsi,  
hind limb and fore limb and was highest  for the flank,  thorax  and ribs.
6. At any carcass  weight,  Hereford  crosses  had the highest  muscle  lipid 
concentration  followed  by MRI crosses,  Friesians,  Limousin,  Simmental,  
Charolais,  Blonde  d’Aquitaine  and Belgian  Blue crosses.  The differences  in 
carcass  weight  between  breeds  at similar  muscle  lipid concentration  were less 
than at similar  carcass  fat proportion.
7. Early maturing  breed  type steers  and heifers  had similar  proportions  of 
carcass  fat when the heifers  were about  50 kg carcass  weight  lighter  than the 
steers.  Despite  being  about  one half class poorer  in conformation,  heifers  had 
a slightly  higher  muscle  proportion  and a considerably  higher  proportion  of 
higher  value  muscle  than  steers.  Despite  big differences  in carcass  conformation  
there  was little difference  in carcass  composition  between  Friesians,  Holsteins  
and MRI crosses.
8. In the Irish cattle population,  fat score is three times as important  as 
conformation  in indicating  muscle  proportion  but both are poor indicators  of 
same.  Any relationship  between  conformation  and muscle  proportion  depends  
on the breed mix involved  but generally  there is no such relationship.
9. The range  in muscle  proportion  for classes  03, 04L, R3 and R4L was 
555 to 621, 521 to 632, 596 to 682 and 525 to 656 g/kg, respectively.  Clearly  
classification  grade  is a poor indicator  of muscle  proportion.
10. Fat score was significantly  related  to both fat proportion  and muscle  
proportion  but accounted  for only one third to one half  of the variance  in these.
Conformation  score was not significantly  related  to muscle  proportion,  fat 
proportion,  high value muscle  proportion  or muscle  size. Its only statistical  
relationship  was with bone proportion.

Exploitation  of Beef Breed  Differences
M. G. KEANE
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
The  reformed  Common  Agricultural  Policy  has introduced  a quota  on suckler  
cow and male cattle numbers  for premia  payments  and has set maximum  
stocking  densities  for premia  eligible  animals.  Therefore,  the best opportunity  
for further  increases  in productivity  and efficiency  in beef production  lies in 
the full exploitation  of the range  of beef  breeds  available.  The main  productivity  
differences  between  the various  beef breeds  have been described  previously  
(Keane,  1990).  The purpose  of this paper  is to quantify  these differences  in 
greater  detail,  and  to include  additional  information  on carcass  composition  and 
quality  differences.  The topics  discussed  here  are (1) trends  in sire breed  usage,  
(2) calving  traits  by sire  breed,  (3) relative  productivity  of progeny  from  different  
sire breeds,  (4) ranking  of approved  bulls  across  breeds,  (5) carcass  composition  
and quality,  and (6) carcass  classification.
Trends  in sire breed  usage
The distribution  of inseminations  by sire breed  since 1985 is shown in  Table  
1. With the exceptions  of 1987 and 1991, when they fell to 32%, Friesian  
inseminations  have remained  constant  at 37% to 39%. Aberdeen  Angus  
inseminations  have also remained  constant  at 9% to 10%.  The consistent  trend  
has been the substitution  of the continental  breeds  for the Hereford.  Hereford  
inseminations  declined  from  32%  in 1985  to 8% in 1992  while  in the same  period  
continental  inseminations  increased  from 19% to 42%.  Within  the continentals  
there have also been changes.  In the mid 1980s,  the proportions  of Charolais,  
Simmental  and Limousin  inseminations  were similar.  Since  then, Simmental  
inseminations  have remained  constant  at about 10%, Limousin  inseminations  
have  increased  slightly  to about  12% while  Charolais  inseminations  have  more

than doubled  to 17%.  Belgian  Blue  inseminations  have  increased  from 0 to 4%. 
Friesian  inseminations  are determined  by the need to provide  replacement  
heifers  for the dairy herd, and Angus  inseminations  appear  to be determined  
by the suitability  of the breed  for use on heifers.  Thus,  the only  real opportunity  
for change  is substitution  amongst  the beef  breeds,  and there  has been  large  scale  
substitution  of continentals  for Hereford  in recent  years.
In addition  to the national  trend it is also of interest  to examine  the trends  
for neighbouring  regions  and countries  (Table  2). Both  England  plus  Wales  and 
Scotland  have a higher proportion  of Friesian  inseminations  than Ireland  
(Republic  and North).  Despite  the decline  mentioned  above,  the Hereford  is still 
more  widely  used here (8%) than in England  plus Wales  (3%),  Scotland  (1%)  
and Northern  Ireland  (2%).  The Angus  is still more  widely  used here  also (9%)  
than in Northern  Ireland  or Britain  (3%-5%).  Thus, early maturing  breed  
inseminations  have  fallen  to 7% in Northern  Ireland,  6% in England  plus Wales  
and to 4% in Scotland  compared  with 17% here. Amongst  the continentals,  
Limousin  inseminations  are fairly  consistent  between  regions  but there  are big 
differences  in Simmental  usage  which  ranges  from 5% in England  plus Wales  
to 20%  inNorthem  Ireland.  Northern  Ireland  has 15%  of  Charolais  inseminations  
compared  with  9% in England  plus  Wales  and 11% in Scotland.  Northern  Ireland  
is also the only  region  where  the Blonde  d’Aquitaine  is fairly  widely  used (9%). 
To date all regions  have similar  usage  of Belgian  Blue (4%-7%).
Since  inseminations  account  for only 50%-60%  of total matings  and since  
more  dairy  cows  are bred by artificial  insemination  (AI) than suckler  cows,  the 
distribution  of inseminations  does  not necessarily  reflect  the distribution  of total 
matings.  Unlike  AI, there  is no national  record  of natural  matings  and the only 
way an estimate  of natural  matings  can be obtained  is by survey.  Such  a survey  
was undertaken  recently  (Drennan  and Power,  1992)  and the distribution  of AI

and total matings  is shown  in Table  3. Friesian  and Angus  constitute  smaller  
proportions  of total matings  than of total inseminations,  and the remaining  
breeds  constitute  proportionately  more. Amongst  the latter,  the Hereford shows  
the greatest  difference  between  AI (8%)  and total  matings  (15%).  The  three  main  
continental  breeds  follow  the same trend  in AI and total  matings  (17%, 9% and 
12%,  and 20%, 11% and 13% for Charolais,  Simmental  and Limousin,  respec ­
tively).  Practically  all Belgian  Blue matings  appear  to have been by AI.
From the breed  distribution  of total matings,  the breed  composition  of the 
national  calf crop for 1993 was predicted  and compared  with previous  years  
(Table  4). Prior  to 1985 Friesians  and Herefords  tended  to substitute  for each 
other  (i.e. when Friesians  decreased  Herefords  increased  and vice versa).  Since  
then however,  continentals  have substituted  for both Friesians  and Herefords.  
From  1985  to 1993  Friesian,  Angus  and Hereford  combined  decreased  from  82% 
to 49%, while continentals  (including  “other ”) increased  from 18% to 51%.  
Thus,  the national  calf crop for 1993 consists  approximately  of 30% Friesians,  
20% early maturing  breed types and 50% continental  breed types with the 
Charolais  constituting  20% of the latter.

Calving  traits by sire breed
Factors  which  have a major  influence  on the breed  of bull used particularly  
in dairy  herds  are the incidence  of calving  difficulty,  calf  mortality  and gestation  
length.  These  are shown  in Table  5 for the different  sire breeds.  In brief,  there  
is little difference  in these traits between  the Friesian,  Angus  and Hereford  
breeds.  For these  the mean  serious  calving  difficulty  percentage  is 2.1, the mean  
calf mortality  percentage  is 1.6 and the mean gestation  length  is 281 days. In 
contrast,  the continentals  have mean calving  difficulty,  calf mortality  and 
gestation  length  values  of 4.9%,  2.3%  and 285 days,  respectively.  There  are some  
differences  in these  traits  amongst  the continental  breeds  but they are not very 
large-Charolais  has the highest  (5.6%)  and Limousin  has the lowest  (4.4%)  
calving  difficulty  incidence,  Belgian  Blue has the highest  (3.0%)  and Blonde  
d’Aquitaine  has the lowest  (1.2%)  calf mortality  and Belgian  Blue has the 
shortest  (283  days)  and Blonde  d’Aquitaine  has the longest  (287  days)  gestation  
length.

Relative  productivity  of progeny  from different  sire breeds
In Ireland,  data on the productivity  of the different  breed  crosses  for beef 
production  are available  from  two sources  - the Breed  Characterisation  Research  
Programme  at Grange  Research  Centre  and the Beef  Progeny  Test Programme  
at the Department  of Agriculture  and Food. The Breed  Characterisation  Re­
search  Programme  provides  data  on a range  of traits  from  feed intake  to muscle  
chemical  composition,  whereas  the Performance  Test data are confined  to 
carcass  gain and carcass  grades.  Where  both programmes  generate  data on the 
same traits these data should  be similar  and the combined  results  from both 
programmes  should  be more  accurate  for these  traits  than the individual  results.  
The data from  the two programmes  for carcass  gain,  carcass  conformation  and 
carcass  fat score are shown  in Table  6. Because  the Breed  Characterisation  
Programme  has not included  the Angus  and the Progeny  Test Programme  has 
no data  yet on the MRI  and  Belgian  Blue,  there  is no comparison  for these  breeds.

Otherwise,  all comparisons  for carcass  gain show  remarkably  good agreement  
and are within  two percentage  points.  The only difference  of any consequence  
is the change  in ranking  of the Simmental  and Blonde  d’Aquitaine  between  the 
two programmes.  There is also very good agreement  between  the two pro­
grammes  in the ranking  for carcass  conformation  and fat score.

and the Progeny  Test  Programme  but all other  trait rankings  are from  the Breed  
Characterisation  Programme  only,  as these  traits  are not reported  for the Progeny  
Test  Programme.  Other  than the Angus  progeny  which  had a lower  value,  there  
was little  difference  in slaughter  weight  for age between  the Friesian,  Hereford,  
MRI,  Limousin  and Blonde  d’Aquitaine  progeny  while  the Simmental,  Belgian  
Blue and Charolais  progeny  were  4% to 7% superior  to these.  All beef  crosses  
had higher  kill-out  values  than Friesians  with the continentals  having  higher  
values  than the traditional  beef breeds.  Carcass  weight  for age differed  little  
between  the Friesian  and Angus  progeny. Hereford,  MRI  and Limousin  progeny  
were  4%-5%  superior  while  the Blonde  d’Aquitaine,  Simmental,  Belgian  Blue  
and Charolais  progeny  were 8%-ll%  superior.
Some  carcass  quality  traits  are also shown  in Table  7. At the same  age, Angus  
progeny  produced  6% less muscle  than  Friesian  and Hereford  progeny  produced  
only the same quantity  of muscle  even though  they had 4% greater  carcass  
weight.  MRI  progeny  produced  6% more  muscle  in line with their  5% superior  
carcass  weight,  indicating  essentially  no difference  in carcass  composition  
between  the Friesians  and MRI crosses.  All continentals  produced  11%-19% 
more  muscle  than Friesian  and Hereford  progeny,  with the Limousin  progeny  
at the lower  end of this range  and the Belgian  Blue and Charolais  progeny  at 
the upper  end. Muscle  size paralleled  muscle  weight  for age. There  was no 
difference  between  the Friesian,  Angus,  Hereford  and MRI progeny  in the 
proportion  of higher  value  muscle.  The continentals  had 2%-3%  more  of their  
muscle  as higher  value muscle.

Ranking  of approved  bulls across  breeds
The Approved  A.I. Beef  Bull List (1993)  compiled  by the Department  of 
Agriculture  and Food shows  the breeding  value  of bulls relative  to the mean  
of their  own breed  (RBV).  In addition,  breed  means  from  the Beef  Progeny  Test 
Programme  are also published.  From these two sources  a ranking  of all the 
approved  bulls  can be compiled  across  breeds.  This is shown for selected  bulls  
(generally  the best and poorest  for growth  rate within  a breed)  in Table  8. To 
generate  such a ranking  some  base must  be assumed.  For the present  purposes  
the base taken  was the mean  of the Angus  breed.  Thus,  the ranking  of the two 
Angus  bulls selected  (COO  and MLI)  did not change.  To calculate  the differ ­
ences  in carcass  weight  between  the progeny  of the various  bulls,  it was also 
assumed  that the progeny  of Friesian  cows  mated  to Angus  bulls of the breed  
mean value for growth  rate, would  have a carcass  weight  of 300 kg when 
slaughtered  at around  two years  of age. The carcass  weights  of the progeny  of 
the other  bulls were calculated  relative  to this. (It should  be kept in mind  that 
only  half  of the difference  in breeding  value  of a bull is passed  on to his progeny).
While  the ranking  of the Angus  bulls did not change  (because  the baseline  
taken was the mean of the Angus  breed),  the breeding  values  of the bulls of 
all the other  breeds  did change  when  expressed  relative  to the mein  of the Angus  
breed.  For example,  Hereford  GSE  which  has an RBV  of 117 relative  to its own 
breed  mean  has an adjusted  breeding  value  (ABV)  of 127 relative  to the mean  
of the Angus  breed.  Similarly,  Limousin  PEB and Charolais  IC27 which  have  
RBVs  of 119 and 115, respectively,  have ABVs  of 131 and 141 relative  to the 
mean of the Angus  breed.  Translated  into differences  in carcass  weight  at a 
constant  age, GSE  is +41 kg, PEB is +47 kg and IC27 is +62 kg. These  values  
indicate  the enormous  potential  in productivity  that exists both between  and 
within  breeds.
Carcass  composition  and quality
In the foregoing  discussion,  it was assumed  that all breed types were  
slaughtered  at a constant  age of about  two years.  This  was  necessary  to emphasise  
the magnitude  of the differences  between  breeds  and between  bulls within  a 
breed.  In practice  however,  animals  of the different  breed  types  are generally  
slaughtered  at different  ages and weights, although,  there  is an acceptable  range  
in composition,  generally  defined  in terms  of fatness,  within  which  carcasses  
must fall. It is widely  believed  that some  breed  types  are leaner  or fatter  than 
others.  This is so only  when  expressed  on an age or weight  constant  basis.  The 
reason  for such age or weight  constant  differences  in composition  is that the 
three  main  carcass  tissues  (muscle,  fat and bone)  have  different  relative  growth  
rates in the different  breed types. Thus, at any constant  end point there are 
differences  in composition,  but if the end point  is allowed  vary with breed  type  
then all breed  types  can have similar  composition  or at least can have similar  
proportions  of carcass  fat. This is illustrated  in Table  9 where  the proportions  
of carcass  fat at 280, 340 and 400 kg carcass  weight  is shown  for the progeny  
of the different  sire breeds  and Friesian  cows. With increasing  weight,  the 
proportion  of fat in the carcass  increased  for all breed  types  but it increased  more
84
rapidly  for some breed types than for others.  For example,  over the carcass  
weight  range  280 to 400 kg the fat concentration  of Hereford  cross carcasses  
increased  by 100 g/kg, compared  with 70 g/kg for Charolais  crosses.  Exami ­
nation  of the data  shows  that Hereford  and Charolais  crosses  had similar  carcass  
fatness  at carcass  weights  of 280 and 400 kg, respectively.  Similarly,  Friesians  
and Simmental  crosses  had similar  carcass  fatness  at carcass  weights  of 340 and 
400 kg, respectively  as did Limousin  and Belgian  Blue crosses.  It can be 
calculated  that Friesians  of 320 kg carcass  weight  had similar  carcass  fatness  
(205 g/kg)  to Hereford  crosses  at 280 kg and Charolais  crosses  at 400  kg. Clearly  
therefore,  all breed  types  can be of similar  fatness  if slaughtered  at the appro ­
priate  carcass  weight.  In the context  of exploiting  the potential  of the different  
breed  types,  substitution  of the Hereford  by the Limousin,  Charolais  and Belgian  
Blue would  permit  increases  in carcass  output  at constant  carcass  fatness  of 
proportionately  0.27,0.43  and 0.50,  respectively.  With  quotas  on cattle  numbers,  
this is a means  through  which  producers  can increase  output  and productivity.
With regard  to the proposed  340 kg carcass  weight  intervention  limit, it is 
worth  noting  that the intermediate  weight  in Table  9 is 340 kg. Where  carcass  
composition  or fatness  is important,  a single  carcass  weight  limit is not appro ­
priate  to a beef industry  which  was a range  of breed  types.  At 340 kg, carcass  
fat proportion  ranged  from 162 g/kg for Belgian  Blue crosses  to 255 g/kg for 
Hereford  crosses.  There  is no suggestion  in the data that any of the breed  types  
had insufficient  fat for general  market  purposes  at 340 kg carcass  weight.
After  the composition  of the carcass,  the next most important  quality  issue  
is the chemical  composition  of the muscle.  The mean  chemical  composition  of 
beef muscle  from the L. dorsi is approximately  720 g/kg moisture,  220 g/kg 
protein,  10 g/kg  ash and  50 g/kg  lipid  (fat).  (The  term  lipid  is used  here  to describe  
the fat which is chemically  extracted  from the muscle  and to differentiate  
between  this chemically  determined  fat and the separable  fat of the carcass).

is shown  for the various  breed  types  in Table  10. As with  separable  fat proportion,  
lipid  proportion  increased  with  increasing  carcass  weight  and  did so more  rapidly  
for some breeds  than for others.  For example,  over the carcass  weight  range  
280 to 400 kg, lipid concentration  increased  by 51 g/kg for Hereford  progeny  
compared  with an increase  of only 21 g/kg for Belgian  Blue progeny.  The 
difference  between  breed types in carcass  weight  at similar  L. dorsi lipid 
concentration  was less than the difference  at similar  carcass  fat proportion.  For 
example,  Hereford  and Charolais  crosses  had similar  muscle  lipid  concentration  
at carcass  weights  of 280 and 340 kg, respectively  compared  with carcass  
weights  of 280 and 400 kg for similar  carcass  fat proportion.  Similarly,  Friesians  
and Charolais  crosses  had similar  muscle  lipid concentrations  at 340 and 400 
kg, respectively  compared  with carcass  weights  of 320 and 400 kg for similar  
carcass  fat proportion.  In the context  of the 340 kg carcass  weight  limit for 
intervention,  it is again  apparent  that there  were  very large  differences  between  
breeds  in muscle  lipid concentration  at this carcass  weight.  For example,  the 
lipid concentration  of Hereford  progeny  muscle  was double  that of Blonde  
d’Aquitaine  and Belgian  Blue progeny  muscle.
Carcass  classification
Carcass  classification  is a widely  discussed  topic  in beef  production,  but there  
is some  confusion  on what  its real purpose  is. The most  commonly  cited  purpose  
is to serve  as a common  language  amongst  the various  sectors  of the beef  industry  
(producers,  processors,  wholesalers,  butchers,  etc.), but what such a common  
language  is supposed  to describe  has not been defined.  There  is a widespread  
belief  that the classification  score indicates  the real quality  and true value of 
a carcass  but this is not necessarily  so. Two  carcasses  with similar  classification  
scores  could  be very  different  in quality  and value  while  two carcasses  of similar  
quality  and value  could  have very different  classification  scores.  Attempts  to
86
evaluate  the usefulness  of classification  are hampered  by the fact  that the grading  
is subjective,  and there are no objectively  measurable  parameters  which  cor­
respond  to the subjective  grades.
Intuitively,  carcass  fat score  would  be considered  a predictor  of the proportion  
of fat in the carcass.  Furthermore,  it would  be expected  that the interval  between  
one class  and the next  would  be the  same for all classes  and thus, that changing  
fat score would  represent  a constant  rate of change  in carcass  fat proportion.  
While  it is generally  believed  that increasing  fat score  does indicate  increasing  
carcass  fatness,  there is nothing  to indicate  what proportion  (or range in 
proportions)  of carcass  fat is indicated  by any particular  fat score or what a 
change  in fat score represents  in terms  of changing  carcass  fat proportion.
The relevance  of conformation  score  is even more  obscure  than that of fat 
score.  One or more  of the following  traits  are generally  believed  to be indicated  
by conformation  - muscle  proportion,  muscle  and fat proportion,  bone  propor ­
tion, muscle/bone  ratio,  muscle  size and muscle  distribution  (e.g. proportion  of 
muscle  in the hind-quarter  or in the higher  value  joints).  Because  cattle are 
generally  slaughtered  within  a fairly  narrow range  of fatness  and conformation,  
it is difficult  to find a data set where  both carcass  classification  and carcass  
compiosition  were measured  over  a usefully  wide  range.  However,  a recent  data 
set from Grange  does have both composition  and classification  measured  on 
96 carcasses  varying  in fatness  and conformation.
The relationships  between  fat class and the proportions  of fat and muscle  
in the carcass are shown in Table 11. Total fat proportion  increased  
by 31 g/kg per unit increase  in fat class.  While  these  changes  were statistically  
significant,  the proportions  of variance  explained  by the regressions  were quite  
low indicating  that while  fat score  was related  to carcass  fat proportion,  it was 
nevertheless  a poor indicator  of carcass  fat proportion.
In contrast  to fat score, which  although  poorly  related,  was nevertheless  
related  to compositional  traits,  conformation  was related  to bone  proportion  only 
and even  then  it explained  only 15% of the variation  in bone  proportion  (Table  
12). Conformation  was not significantly  related  to muscle  proportion,  fat 
proportion,  muscle  size or the proportion  of muscle  in the higher  value  joints.  
For all practical  purposes  therefore,  conformation  had no relationship  with 
actual  carcass  composition  or real carcass  value.

The reason  why classification  score  is a poor indicator  of composition  and 
value is evident  from the data in Table 13 which  shows  the range in fat and 
muscle  proportions  and proportion  of higher  value  muscle  for the classes  04L, 
03, R4L and R3. For R4L, fat proportion  ranged  from 161 to 305 g/kg. This 
range  covered  all of the 03 range  and most  of the R3 and 04L ranges.  For 04L, 
muscle  proportion  ranged  from 521 to 632 g/kg, for 03, it ranged  from 555 to 
621 g/kg, for R4L, it ranged  from 525 to 656 g/kg, and for R3, it ranged  from  
596 to 682 g/kg. Therefore,  except  for the upper  end of the R3 range,  all the 
carcasses  could have fitted within  the R4L muscle  range. Similarly,  for the 
proportion  of higher  value  muscle,  except  for the upper  end of R4L,  all carcasses  
could  have fitted  within  the 03 higher  value  muscle  range.  These  data demon ­
strate  that classification  did not reasonably  differentiate  between  carcasses  on 
the basis of either  fat proportion,  muscle  proportion  or proportion  of muscle  
in the higher  value joints.
As the carcasses  in question  came  from  3 breed  types  - Friesians  (FR),  MRI  
X Friesians  (MR)  and Belgian  Blue  x Friesians  (BB),  it was of interest  to examine  
the relationship  between  fat score  and carcass  fat proportion  within  breed  type

*FR = Friesian,  MR = MRI x Friesian,  BB = Belgian  Blue x Friesian
(Table  14). At both  fat classes  3 and 4L, FR had a higher  proportion  of fat than  
MR which  in turn had a higher  proportion  of fat than BB. There  is no obvious  
explanation  why the relationship  between  fat class and carcass  fat proportion  
should  vary with breed  type. Muscle  proportion  varied  also with breed  type at 
constant  fat class,  but the differences  between  FR and MR in muscle  proportion  
and proportion  of higher  value  muscle  were  quite  smalt,  whereas  the differences  
between  these two and BB were quite large at any particular  fat class.
As well as differing  at constant  fat class, breeds  also differed  at constant  
conformation  class  (Table  15). Since  there  were  few  BB animals  in conformation  
class O and few FR animals  in conformation  class R, the comparison  at each  
conformation  class  involves  only  two breed  types.  At conformation  class  O there  
was little  difference  between  FR and MR but at conformation  class  R, BB had 
36 g/kg less fat and 44 g/kg more muscle  than MR. Thus,  there was a much  
greater  difference  between  breeds within a single conformation  class than 
between  the means  for different  conformation  classes.
There  are many  reasons  why  fat class  might  not be a good  predictor  of carcass  
fat proportion  (differences  between  graders,  variations  in grading  with prevail ­
ing levels  of fat and type of cattle,  disturbance  of fat by the operation  of the 
hide puller),  but obvious  reasons  are that less than 50% of the total fat is

subcutaneous  fat which  is visible  to the grader  and also that subcutaneous  fat 
is not a constant  proportion  of total  fat. Variation  in subcutaneous  fat with  breed  
type and carcass  weight  is shown  in Table 16. At a carcass  weight  of 280 kg 
subcutaneous  fat as a proportion  of total fat ranged  from  406 g/kg for Charolais  
crosses  to 445 g/kg for Hereford  crosses.  With increasing  carcass  weight,  
subcutaneous  fat as a proportion  of total carcass  fat increased  until at 400 kg 
carcass  weight  it ranged  from 458 g/kg for Belgian  Blue crosses  to 507 g/kg 
for Herefords.  These  variations  suggest  that the carcasses  of early maturing  
breed  types  and heavy  carcasses  appear  fatter  than they actually  are (because  
more  of their  total  fat is visible)  relative  to carcasses  of late maturing  breed  types  
and heavy  carcasses.

Land
Our farm is an all-grass  farm of 86 map acres,  adjusted  to 70 acres and 10 
acres are rented.  Ten acres are fenced  off for deer which  leaves  70 acres for 
sheep.  This land consists  of a wet peaty soil on the flat and heavy  soil on the 
hills. Thirteen  acres were reclaimed  from cut-away  bog which  floods  during  
winter  and in wet summers.  As a result  some constraints  arise: early grass is 
difficult  to produce  on this farm; flock turnout  in spring  is delayed  until late 
March  and all sheep  must be returned  to the sheds before  Christmas.
It is very good land for producing  grass  in dry summers.  Last summer  was 
difficult  due to the wet, cold conditions.
Winter  feeding
Ewes are housed  on straw and meal feeding  commences  8 weeks  prior to 
lambing  with 120 g per head per day increasing  to 700 g for the last 3 weeks  
pre-lambing.  From  lambing  to turnout  nearly  1 kg per ewe per day is fed. The 
ration  consists  of a barley/beet  pulp/soyabean  mix (18%  crude  protein)  and  sheep  
minerals.
Lambing  date
Lambing  is from March  7 to mid-April  during  which there is 24 hour  
supervision.  Fostering  lambs  on the ewes  with  single  lambs  is part  of the system.  
Lambs  are 2 weeks  old when  the flock is moved  to grass.  No meals  are fed at 
grass  post lambing  or during  the summer.  Meals  are introduced  to light lambs  
remaining  in late October  but intakes  are low until mid November.

Our pattern  of lamb  sales  is usually  2 weeks  behind  most  sheep  farmers: This  
is caused  by several  factors.  Firstly,  we have  a coccidiosis  problem.  All our  lambs  
are affected  by it between  4 and 8 weeks  of age. Mortality  is negligible  but growth  
rates are adversely  affected.  Secondly,  we ensure  that all our ewes  are suckling  
2 lambs  if they have two sound  teats. So, we have no ‘single ’ lambs.  Thirdly,  
we have  a high  percentage  of triplets  and quads  which  are slower  to mature  than 
singles  or twins.
Buffer  feed
Owing to our high stocking  rate we are vulnerable  to severe weather  
conditions.  Hence,  we always  keep a full year’s supply  of silage  on reserve  to 
act as a buffer  in these conditions.
Deer
Present  Red Deer stock consists  of 36 hinds, 16 calves  and 1 stag.
Future
We feel that the carcass  quality  of our lambs  is satisfactory.  Last  autumn  we 
introduced  a Suffolk  and a Charollais  ram into the  flock  for breeding  purposes.  
We intend  to continue  improving  the milking  ability  of our ewes.

Systems  of Early  Lamb  Production
S. FLANAGAN
Teagasc,  Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam, Co. Galway.
One  of the principal  difficulties  in managing  a high  output  grass-based  system  
of early lamb production  is the lack of grass growth  during  winter  and early  
spring.  This, in particular,  limits the stock carrying  capacity  of permanent  
pastures.  In the search  for a resolution  of this problem,  two alternative  systems  
have  been  developed  at the Teagasc  Sheep  Farm,  Knockbeg,  Carlow  based  either  
on autumn  sown  Italian  ryegrass  or on fodder  beet grown  as a main  crop. Both  
crops produce  high quality  feed at relatively  low cost.
It will be shown  in this report  that these  crops  have a high feeding  capacity  
for early  lambing  ewes  and  that,  when  properly  supplemented  with  concentrates,  
the resulting  lamb  growth  rates were  sufficiently  high to meet  target  sale dates  
for early marketing.  Both  systems  were  examined  by using  the farmlet  system  
approach.  Inputs  and outputs  were recorded  in order  to provide  guidelines  for 
feed budgeting  and planned  production.  It is considered  that the growing  of I. 
ryegrass  provides  a useful  option  for all-grass  farms which  carry early lamb  
enterprises  and which  require  silage  conservation  for livestock.  Production  of 
fodder  beet  is confined  mainly  to sugar  beet  growing  areas  where  the technology  
for growing,  harvesting  and feeding  the crop mechanically  is well developed.
(1) ALL-GRASS  SYSTEM
The research  at Knockbeg  involved  grazing  by flocks  lambing  in January  
1988 and 1989.  In preparation  for this, Italian  ryegrass  (cv. Lemtal)  was sown 
by direct  reseeding  in August  1987 at the rate of 40 kg per ha. Compound  
fertiliser  (10:10:20)  was applied  at 250 kg per ha at time of sowing.
Ewes were housed  in early December  and fed silage  ad libitum  with con­
centrate  supplements,  commencing  at the rate of 0.25 kg per ewe per day and 
increasing  to 0.70 kg in the final two weeks  before  lambing.  After  lambing  in 
1988  the turnout  of ewes  and lambs  to the I. ryegrass  was delayed  for three  weeks  
due to unfavourable  weather.  During  this  time  the ewes  were  fed silage  ad libitum  
plus 1.6 kg concentrates  per head  per day. Lambs  were  introduced  to creep  feed 
at 1 week old.  The turnout  date was January  14. In 1989  ewes  and lambs  were  
turned  out three weeks  earlier,  i.e. January  24. The number  of lambs  per ewe  
grazing  was 1.33 in 1988 and 1.55 in 1989.
Pasture  management
Ewes and lambs  were turned  out to the I. ryegrass  in early February.  The 
I. ryegrass  was sub-divided  into temporary  paddocks  using portable  electric  
fencing.  The aims  of grazing  management  were to offer  the pasture  for grazing  
on an unrestricted  basis and to optimise  the conditions  for achieving  high lamb  
growth  rates. Hence,  ewes  and lambs  were  moved  to a new paddock  whenever  
supplies  in the paddock  being  grazed  were considered  limiting,  i.e. when the 
sward  height  was grazed  down  to about  4 cm. This meant  in practice  that each
94
paddock  was grazed  for 5-6 days.  Concentrate  supplements  were  trough  fed at 
the rate of 0.5 kg per ewe per day for 5-6 weeks.  Lambs  were creep  fed until 
they reached  slaughter  weight.
In both  years,  the first  grazing  of I. ryegrass  was  completed  after  4 to 5 weeks,  
i.e. early March.  The flock  was then transferred  to permanent  pastures,  mainly  
perennial  ryegrass,  which  had been rested  for the winter  and dressed  with 34 
kg N fertiliser  per ha on about  February  1. The stocking  rate on the permanent  
pasture  in 1988 was high, 24 ewes  per ha. However,  this stocking  rate was not 
supported  solely on the permanent  pasture,  as whenever  the I. ryegrass  had 
recovered  sufficiently,  second  and third  grazings  were  taken.  In order  to provide  
for summer  cuts of silage,  the I. ryegrass  pasture  was closed  in early April.  From  
then until  July,  the flock  was grazed  exclusively  on the permanent  pasture,  with 
the stocking  rate declining  regularly  as lambs  were  drafted  for slaughter  during  
April and May.
Lambs  were weighed  and drafted  at a standard  body finish  as assessed  by 
handling  for light-to-medium  fat cover  on the loin, rump and tail. They were  
weaned  in mid-April  and grazed  selectively  thereafter,  while  the ewes  were  mob 
stocked  at 50 ewes  per ha. Following  silage  cutting  during  summer,  grazing  of 
1. ryegrass  was resumed  in late  July  when  ewes  were  flushed  for a new  production  
cycle.
Two years ’ results
Lamb  performance  and details  of concentrate  inputs  are shown  in Table 1. 
Lamb  growth  rates in early lactation,  315g/day  in 1988 and 300g/day  in 1989,  
met the requirements  of early marketing  as shown by the average  age at 
slaughter,  92 days and 102 days in 1988 and 1989 respectively.
The  amounts  of I. ryegrass  pasture  on offer  for grazing  at turnout,  as estimated  
by clips taken  at ground  level,  were 1200  kg DM per ha in 1988,  and 1600 kg 
in 1989.
Under  the grazing  conditions  described  above, the realised  stocking  rate was 
16.8 ewes  per ha when  averaged  over the two years.  These  results  confirm  the 
advantage  of I. ryegrass  for short-term  grazing  as a means of overcoming  
seasonal  constraints  in the supplies  of permanent  pasture,  as occur in early  
spring.
Lamb  growth  rates from 5 weeks  of age to slaughter  were high, 346g and 
334g/day  in 1988 and 1989 respectively,  and as a result,  finished  liveweights  
for slaughter  were  achieved  at a young  age, viz., 13 weeks  on average  in 1988.  
In 1989 it was decided  to retain  lambs  for extended  grazing  in order  to increase  
carcass  weights.  As a result,  average  carcass  weight  in 1989  was over  2kg heavier  
than in 1988 but the lambs were 10 days older at slaughter.  In relation  to 
maximising  the financial  returns  from  early  lamb  production,  management  must  
strike  a delicate  balance  in this matter  as the trade is characterised  by falling  
prices  following  the initial  peak in April.
Almost  all lambs  reached  finished  liveweights  by June 1, the date around  
which mid-season  supplies  arrive  on the market  and the price  falls by about  20 
per cent.
95
The concentrate  inputs  shown  in Table  1 provide  guidelines  for drawing  up 
feed  budgets  for the production  of early-season  lambs  under  grazing  conditions.  
Concentrate  inputs  for ewes were similar  for both years  but lambs  consumed  
45%  more  creep  in 1989  than  in 1988,  due to being  retained  longer  at grass  before  
drafting.

Conclusion
These  results  were  recorded  at Knockbeg  using  a farmlet  system  approach,  
and they can be interpreted  for planning  early lamb production  on all-grass  
farms.
Autumn  sown  I. ryegrass  provides  strategic  grazing  for  January  lambing  ewes  
at a time of year when permanent  pasture  supplies  are scarce.  For short-term  
grazing,  it can be stocked  at 16 to 17 ewes  per ha when  concentrate  supplements  
are fed as described.
During  the finishing  period  in April  and May permanent  pasture,  which has 
been suitably  managed  during  winter,  can be stocked  at 16 to 24 ewes per ha
96
depending on grazing  date, declining  as lambs  are drafted.  During  the summer  
the dry flock  can be stocked  at 50 ewes  per ha while  the I. ryegrass  is used for 
'2 to 3 cuts of silage.
The period  of flushing,  hormone  treatment  and post-mating  management,  
including  repeat  matings  in October,  extends  from  late July to late November.  
Fertilised  pastures  at Knockbeg  were stocked  at 25 ewes per ha during  this 
period.  In October  this was reduced  to 15 ewes per ha, when repeat  breeders  
were  removed  and managed  separately  for spring  lambing.  Thus,  stocking  rate 
varies  widely  during  the extended  grazing  season,  depending  on the require ­
ments  of the flock.
(2) FODDER  BEET/GRASS  SYSTEM
In the previous  system  ewes were lambed  down in mid January,  managed  
indoor  for one to three weeks  and turned  out to early grass when the risk of 
weather  hazards  had receded.  Flocks  that are lambed  down in December  and 
turned  out to forage  crops  and grass  after lambing  are subject  to unfavourable  
weather  conditions  which  may result  in management  difficulties.  In the period  
1990-91  an indoor  feeding  system  for managing  ewes  and lambs  for 5-6 weeks  
post-lambing  was developed.  This was followed  by pasture  grazing  for late 
lactation  and for finishing  the lambs.  It will be shown  in this report  that early  
lambing  ewes  can be managed  very  effectively  indoor  on a diet  of chopped  roots.  
As a result,  flock  management  at this critical  phase  of the production  cycle  can 
proceed  unhindered  by adverse  weather.  However,  it will also be shown  that 
lamb  growth  rates in late lactation,  when  lambs  were turned  out to pasture,  can 
vary from year to year.
Fodder  beet diet
Ewes  lambing  in early January  were housed  in late November,  fed silage  ad 
libitum  and concentrate  supplements  at the rate of 0.25kg  per ewe per day 
initially,  increasing  to 0.70kg  in the final two weeks  before  lambing.
After  lambing,  the flock  was group  penned  in a straw  bedded  shed  at 20 ewes  
plus their lambs  per pen, stocked  at 1.9 sq. m per ewe. Chopped  fodder  beet 
(cv. Kyros)  was fed ad libitum  and hay was fed as a source  of fibre at the rate 
of 0.35 kg/ewe/day.
Initially,  a protein  supplement  was fed at the rate of 500 g soyabean  meal/  
ewe/day.  However,  the intake  of fodder  beet by the ewes increased  rapidly  and 
after  about  2 weeks  reached  2000  g DM/head/day . This  was higher  than  expected  
and the level  of protein  supplementation  was increased  to 700 g soyabean  meal 
in order  to achieve  a ratio  of about 14 g crude  protein  per MJ of ME in the diet.  
Minerals/vitamins  were  fed at the rate of 50 g/ewe/day.  Lambs  were  creep  fed 
from one week of age.
Management  approach
Although  it was planned  to move  ewes and lambs  to early grass after 5-6 
weeks,  unfavourable  weather  in both years  delayed  turnout  until 8 weeks  post­
lambing,  i.e. early  March.  The  early  grass  consisted  mainly  of perennial  ryegrass  
and some  Italian  ryegrass  rested  since  October  and dressed  with fertiliser  N at
97
the rate of 45kg  N per ha on about  February  1. The basic approach  to grazing  
management  was to optimise  the conditions  for high lamb growth  rates. The 
flock  was grazed  rotationally  by using  portable  electric  fencing  and was moved  
to a new paddock  whenever  the pasture  was grazed  down  to a sward  height  of 
about  4cm. The lambs  were creep  fed until slaughter.
Lambs  were  drafted  for slaughter  from  early April  onwards  as soon as they 
reached  finished  liveweights.  This was assessed  by weighing  and handling  the 
lambs  for light to medium  fat cover  on the loin, rump and tail. Weaning  was 
carried  out in mid-April;  the lambs  were  grazed  selectively  while  the ewes  were  
mob stocked  at 50 ewes per ha.
Lamb  growth  rate
Lamb  performance  results  and concentrate  inputs  are summarised  in Table  
2. Average  lamb growth  rate from birth to 5 weeks  of age was 288g/day  in 
1990  and 257g/day  in 1991.  The reasons  for the lower  growth  rate in 1991 are 
not clear  as the management  system  was similar  in both years and there were  
no apparent  disease  problems;  it may have  been  associated  with  a relatively  high 
proportion  of old ewes in the flock in 1991.

Although  flock  turnout  was delayed  until lambs  were 8 weeks  of age, there  
were no flock health problems  during  the extended  feeding  period  indoor. 
Special  attention  was devoted  to bedding  the pens daily with straw and to 
cleaning  the feed troughs  and drinkers.  Ewes become  accustomed  quickly  to 
fodder  beet after lambing  by introducing  a small  amount  of it in the last week 
of pregnancy  e.g. about 1 kg per head per day.
98
In 1990 lamb  growth  rate during  the finishing  period  on pasture  was 323g/  
day and 70% of lambs  were drafted  at finished  liveweights  during  April,  the 
month  in which  peak prices  prevail.  All lambs  were drafted  by June 1.
Lamb  growth  rate was considerably  lower  in 1991 than in 1990.  As a result,  
the 1991 lambs  were on average  28 days older  than in 1990 when  drafted  for 
slaughter.  The  reduced  growth  rate in 1991 was associated  with  very  high  rainfall  
in April resulting  in waterlogged  ground  conditions  which made grazing  
difficult.  The contrasting  conditions  for lamb thrive  on spring  pasture  in 1990  
and 1991 may be gauged  from the rainfall  recordings  at Oakpark  Research  
Centre  as follows:
Rainfall  (mm)
1990April
20.9
1991 92.3
1981-91  Average 49.4
Although  there is no evidence  that wet weather  affects  pasture  dry matter  
intake by lambs,  it is considered  that prolonged  heavy rain  is stressful  and may 
reduce  lamb  growth  rate. The  rate at which  lambs  were  drafted  in 1991 was slow,  
25%  during  April  compared  with  70% in 1990  (Table  1). In the context  of falling  
prices  as the early season  progresses,  it is clearly  desirable  that the majority  of 
lambs  should  reach finished  liveweights  during  April and early May.
The concentrate  inputs  shown  in Table  2 provide  guidelines  for drawing  up 
feed budgets  for the production  of early season  lambs  on fodder  beet diets fed 
indoor  during  early  lactation,  followed  by finishing  on grazed  pasture.  Concen ­
trate  supplements  fed to ewes  were  higher  in 1991 than in 1990  due to a shortage  
of silage  arising from  summer  drought  and a longer  indoor  feeding  period  post­
lambing.
The consumption  of creep  feed by lambs  up to 6 weeks  of age was low, 4 
to 5kg per head;  intake  increased  subsequently.  In the two years  under  review,  
lambs  consumed  over twice  as much  creep feed in 1991 compared  with 1990  
as shown  in Table 1. It is likely  that this effect  was due to the unsatisfactory  
conditions  for grazing  in 1991, as described  above,  which  in turn resulted  in 
an extended  finishing  period.
The realised  stocking  rate on early grass during  March  was 12.3 ewes per 
ha in 1990 and 12.4 ewes per ha in 1991.
Advantages  of fodder  beet
The main advantages  of fodder  beet as feed for sheep are:
* Both ewes and lambs  have high potential  intakes  of fodder  beets when 
chopped,  equivalent  to over  3% of body  weight. Despite  their  bulky nature,  
sheep  consume  as much  dry matter  in the form of pulped  roots as they 
can on all-concentrate  diets.
* Fodder  beet  can be produced  at about  one-third  of the cost of concentrates.
* Developments  in the design  of harvesters,  fodder  feeders  and diet wagons  
have overcome  the technical  problems  of handling  fodder  beet roots.
99
Conclusion
By housing  early  lambing  flocks  for 5 to 6 weeks  after  lambing,  the weather  
hazards  associated  with turning  out ewes with their  young  lambs  to pasture  or 
root crops  in January  are avoided.  Housing  facilitates  control  over  the manage ­
ment system,  adequate  intakes  of high quality  feed are assured,  lamb growth  
rates are predictable  and labour  efficiency  in feeding  and supervision  are 
enhanced.  Good  housing  facilities  and suitable  machinery  for feeding  roots  are 
essential.  In occasional  years  heavy  rain in spring  may cause  difficult  grazing  
conditions;  temporary  transfer  of the flock  to a dry paddock  elsewhere  and extra  
supplementation  may be necessary.

Grazing  Management  for Sheep
E. J. GRENNAN
Teagasc,  Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam, Co. Galway.
The growth  rate of lambs  on pasture  can vary greatly,  depending  on the type  
of pasture  being grazed.  Sward  height  and method  of grazing  (set stocking,  
paddocks, creep  grazing)  may affect  lamb  growth  rate. The requirement  for and 
response  to meal supplementation  at pasture  will also be affected  by pasture  
supply.  The aim of this paper  is to outline  the effects  of grazing  management  
and meal supplementation  on lamb growth  rate pre and post weaning.
Pasture  height
This has been used in grazing  trials  at Belclare  to study  the effect  of grazing  
management  on lamb  growth  rate. In general  sward  height  is a useful  guide  to 
the quantity  of herbage  available  and its suitability  for sheep  grazing.  The rising  
plate  pasture  meter  used  gives  a reliable  measurement  particularly  when  pasture  
is in the vegetative  (leafy)  state. Caution  is needed  with height  measurements  
taken  in late May  and  June  when  pastures  may be getting  stemmy  if undergrazed  
at this time. Stemmy  pasture  can give high readings  for sward  height  but these  
are a poor indicator  of the suitability  of the pasture  for sheep.
Lamb  growth  pre-weaning
■Set stocking:  The first priority  is to have  enough  grass  to meet  the high feed  
demands  of ewes after lambing.  Table 1 shows  the effect  of sward  height  on 
the growth  rate of lambs  set stocked  from birth to weaning  at 14 weeks  of age 
in late  June  (1). Results  show  that a sward  height  of about  6 cm is near  optimum  
until late May when lambs  are about 10 weeks  of age. Tight  grazing  at 4 cm 
reduces  lamb  growth  rate. However,  lax grazing  at 9 cm, which requires  a lower  
stocking  rate, gives  little increase  in lamb  growth.  This lax grazing,  especially  
in May, results  in selective  grazing  by sheep  and the pasture  becoming  quite  
stemmy  in June. This is more obvious  on old permanent  pastures  where  
unpalatable  grasses  such as red fescue  are rejected,  resulting  in the pasture  
developing  a patch-work  appearance  of tightly  grazed  areas  and rejected  high-  
grass areas.  Table 1 also shows  that lamb growth  rate in June (10-14  weeks)  
is lower than in April-May  (0-10 weeks)  at all sward heights  and some  
adjustment  in grazing  management  is required  to maintain  high lamb growth  
rates in June.

Rotational  grazing:  If paddock  grazing  is used, the question  arises  as to how 
tightly  they should  be grazed  before  moving  sheep  to the next  paddock  and what  
effect  this will have  on lamb  growth.  Results  in Table  2 with a ewe lamb  flock  
show  that weaning  weights  were  highest  when  paddocks  were  grazed  down  to 
about  6 cm (2). Very tight grazing  to 3 cm for the 14 weeks  depressed  lamb  
weaning  weight  significantly.  Closer  examination  of these  and  other  results  from  
grazing  trials at Belclare  suggests  that a post-grazing  height  of 6 cm may not 
be appropriate  for April,  May and June.  Grazing  to 4 or 6 cm in April  had little 
effect  on the 5 week  weight  of lambs.  The effect  is more  significant  when  tight 
grazing  is continued  in May and June. This may be explained  by the fact that 
in April  grass  is very  leafy  and high  quality  and so sheep  can graze  tightly  without  
restricting  their  performance.  Later  in May/June  the base  of the sward becomes  
more  stemmy  as the flowering  stems  rise.  Tight  grazing  at this time  forces  lambs  
to eat herbage  of lower  digestibility,  thereby  reducing  their performance.  As 
a general  guide,  post grazing  height  of 4, 5 and 6 cm may be more  appropriate  
for April,  May and June respectively.  For the same reasons  sward  heights  of 
5 and 6 cm may be adequate  in April and May respectively  for set stocking.
Lamb  growth  in June
Records  from many experiments  indicate  that the growth rate of March  born 
lambs  from 10 to 14 weeks  is often  much  lower  than in the period  up to 10 weeks  
of age. This reduced  growth  rate occurs  in late May and June when  ewe milk 
supply  is decreasing  and lambs  are becoming  increasingly  dependent  on pasture.  
This pasture  may either  be getting  stemmy  if undergrazed  in May or it may be 
too short due to drought  or too high stocking  rate. A reduction  of 35 g/day  in 
growth  rate during  this time means  a loss of 1 kg in weaning  weight.  Records  
suggest  that the potential  loss in weaning  weight  ranges  from 1 to 3 kg. Since  
it requires  about 1 week gazing  on good pasture  for weaned  lambs  to gain 1 
kg liveweight,  it follows  that the reduced  growth  rate pre-weaning  can delay  
sale date of finished  lambs  by 1 to 3 weeks.
Results  at Belclare  over  3 years  indicate  that with  some  adjustments  in grazing  
management  it is possible  to keep lamb growth  at a high rate in June. The 
objective  is to offer  lambs  leafy grass  of a high quality  similar  to that normally  
available  in April and May. Three  different  pastures  were grazed  by ewes and

lambs  from 10 to 14 weeks  of age: Pasture  A was set stocked  at 5-6 cm height  
up to 10 weeks  and grazed  at the same  height  in June: Pasture  B was similarly  
grazed  up to late May and at 6-8 cm height  in June: Pasture  C was aftergrass  
(silage  cut mid-May)  and grazed  at 8-9 cm in June. Results  in Table  3 show  
that lamb  growth  rate was affected  by the pasture  being  grazed.  Increasing  the 
height  from  5-6 cm to 6-8 cm improved  growth  rates  considerably,  with  highest  
growth  rates on aftergrass  available  ad lib. It is concluded  that while  a sward  
height  of about  6 cm is adequate  up to about  the end of May for set stocking,  
an increase  in height  is necessary  in June  in order  to maintain  high  lamb  growth  
rates. Tight  grazing  in May  prevents  seed-heads  developing  while  the increased  
height  in June  allows  for the growth  of new leafy  material.  This  increased  height  
in June may be achieved  by applying  nitrogen  in late May  or by increasing  the 
grazing  area, by, for example  including  a paddock  cut for silage  in mid-May.  
The provision  of aftergrass  for weaned  lambs  is generally  desirable  but few 
sheep  fanners  would  be in a position  to have adequate  aftergrass  available  for 
ewes and lambs  in June. In some situations  it might  be possible  to allow the 
lambs  to forward  creep  graze  on the aftergrass  while  the ewes are setstocked.  
Lambs  would  have access  to high quality  pasture  and the area of aftergrass  
required  would  be much smaller.
Creep  feeding  and creep  grazing
The response  of ewes  or lambs  to meal  feeding  in spring  will depend  on the 
supply  of grass available.  Results  from England  suggest  that there is little 
response  to feeding  meals  to ewes  after  lambing  unless sward height  falls below  
about  4 cm for set stocking  (3). At Belclare  O’Riordan  found  no response,  in 
ewes or lambs,  to feeding  250 g/day to ewe lambs  for 5 weeks  after lambing  
when  grazing  down  to 3.0,4.5 or 6 cm in a rotational  grazing  system  (I). When  
the same level of creep  was fed to the lambs  from 5 to 14 weeks  there was a 
response  to creep  with tight grazing  to 3 cm but not with lax grazing  to 6 cm.
In separate  experiments  the effect  of creep feeding  and creep  grazing  was 
investigated  over two seasons  at Belclare.  Pastures  were rotationally  grazed  
down  to either  4 or 6 cm using a ewe lamb flock in Year 1 and mature  ewes  
in Year 2. Creep  feed was fed at the 4 cm height  only from 5 to 14 weeks  at 
250 g/day.  The facility  to creep  graze  was available  at both heights  and availed  
of by lambs  increasingly  from about seven weeks  of age. Results  in Table  4 
show  that tight  grazing  to 4 cm in May-June  restricted  lamb  growth  more  than 
lax grazing  to 6 cm. Lamb  growth  rates  were  improved  by creep  feeding  or creep

grazing.  The average  response  to creep  grazing  was 2.9 kg at 4 cm and 1.7 kg 
at 6 cm, while  the response  to creep  feeding  averaged  3.9 kg at the 4 cm height.
These  results,  taken  in conjunction  with the previous  trials  at Belclare  show  
that the response  to meal  feeding  or creep  grazing  will depend  on sward  height.  
While  very tight grazing  in May/June  is beneficial  in preventing  the pasture  
becoming  stemmy  it does  reduce  lamb  growth  rate, but this can be counteracted  
by creep  feeding  or creep  grazing. The latter  option  may be most  feasible  where  
a paddock  grazing  system  is in use. The response  to either  creep  feeding  or creep  
grazing  will be small where  high quality  pasture  is available  ad lib.
Lamb  growth  post weaning
The  growth  rate  of lambs  on pasture  post  weaning  can vary  greatly  and  reports  
of poor growth  rates on farms are frequent.  Growth  rates under controlled  
conditions  in research  flocks can range from under 100 to over 200 g/day  
depending  on the pasture  being  grazed. Pasture  height,  clover  content,  previous  
grazing  management  and “clean  pasture ” can all affect  the rate of lamb  growth.  
In some farm situations  mineral  deficiencies,  such as cobalt,  or inadequate  
dosing  practices  are blamed.
Set stocking
Table  5 shows  the typical  effect  of pasture  height  on lamb  growth  on pastures  
of low clover  content  and grazed  by sheep  pre-weaning.  A height  of about  9 
cm gives highest  growth  rates in contrast  to about  6 cm in April/May.  Tight

grazing  on summer  pasture  forces  lambs  to graze down into a layer of poor  
quality  herbage  at the base of the sward  resulting  in poor lamb growth  rates.
Rotational  grazing - . ■ u •
Table 6 shows  the general  effect  of grazing  down to different  heights  m 
rotational grazing,  and also  the effect  of different  pastures.  Highest  growth  rates  
are associated  with leafy pasture,  rich in clover.  Growth  rates up to 200 g/day 
can also  be obtained  on aftergrass.  The lower  parasite  levels  on this pasture  may 
account  for the higher  lamb  growth  rates. It is difficult  to get grow*  rates  higher  
than 150 to 170 g/day  on pasture  grazed  by ewes/lambs  up to weaning  (no matter  
how intensive  the dosing  routine).  Grazing  down  below about  6 cm in paddocks  
also reduces  growth  rate as lambs  are forced  to eat poor quality  herbage.  A 
system  of leader/follower  grazing  would  be beneficial  (where  paddocks  ^e 
available)  with  lambs  grazing  ahead  of ewes,  keeping  in mind  the need  to restrict  
the diet of ewes  post weaning  and allow a  build  up of grass for autumn  flushing.
Effect  of grazing  management  pre-weaning
As indicated  earlier,  tight  grazing  in May/June  results  in a more  leafy  pasture  
post weaning.  This can affect  lamb growth  if weaned  lambs  grazed  the same  
area postweaning.  Results  in Table 7 illustrate  this effect at Belclare.  when

weaned  lambs  were  highly  stcx:ked (at pasture  heights  up to 7.5 cm) growth  rates  
were highest  on pasture  grazed  down to 3 cm pre-weaning.  However  when 
weaned  lambs  were grazed on pasture  at about  9 cm lambs  growth  rate was not 
affected  by grazing  height  pre-weaning.  It appears  that at low stocking  rate (9 
cm) lambs  could  select  a similar  diet from  all pastures  but at high stocking  rate 
and shorter  grass  the penalty  for lax grazing  pre-weaning  is evident. The  highest  
growth  rates were  about  160 g/day  on these  pastures  grazed  by ewes/lambs  pre- 
weaning.
Feeding  concentrates  at pasture
As in spring-time  the response  to feeding  concentrates  to weaned  lambs  on 
pasture  will depend  on the quantity  and quality  of the pasture  being  grazed.  The 
response  will be small where pasture  alone supports  a high growth  rate. 
Conversely  the response  will be greater  where  pasture  alone supports  a low 
growth  rate. Results  in Table  8 show the response  of lambs  to feeding  meals  
on pasture  in autumn  at Belclare.  There  is a response  to meals  especially  where  
grass  is short.  The extra  carcass  gain due to meal feeding  would  cover  the cost 
of the meals.  It does allow  lambs  to be  finished  that would  not finish  on pasture  
alone  in autumn  and may otherwise  have  to be sold  as stores.  It also allows  lambs  
to be finished  earlier  and this may be important  if lamb  prices  are falling  at that 
time.

Mixed  grazing
Lamb  growth  rate to weaning  is generally  higher  in mixed  cattle/sheep  than 
in all sheep  grazing  systems.  Weaning  weights  are about  2 kg higher  with  mixed  
grazing  (4). The higher  growth  rates may be attributed  to several  factors  such 
as more  grass  available  to sheep,  including  high grass  areas  around  dung-pats,  
more  nutritious  grass near  dung  pats, more  clover  in mixed-grazed  pastures  and 
lower  parasite  levels.
At Belclare  a similar  2 kg advantage  in weaning  weight  was obtained  when 
ewes/lambs  grazed  pasture  not grazed  by sheep in the previous  year. Due to 
the limited  amount  of silage  required  in all-sheep  systems  it is difficult  to plan 
to have “clean  grazing ” for lambs  in spring.  Clean  grazing  is mainly  required

when  lambs  are eating  an appreciable  quantity  of grass  after 4-5 weeks  of age. 
It would  be useful  for nematodirus  control  to have  “clean  pasture ” available  from  
mid-April  to the end of May.
Dosing  lambs
In all sheep  systems  at Belclare  the routine  dosing  of spring  born lambs  is 
at 5 wks, 10 wks and 14 wks (weaning).  More  intensive  dosing  at I'h and 12 
weeks  gave  no growth-rate  response  up to weaning.  A similar  result  was obtained  
with a ewe lamb flock grazing  the same area in two successive  years.
Post-weaning,  lambs  should  be grazed  on “clean  pasture ” if available.  Dosing  
requirements  will depend  on where  the lambs are  grazing.  On plgan  pasture  one 
dose  about  3 weeks  post-weaning  may  be enough.  If dq clean  grazing  is available  
we dose  lambs  at about  3 week  intervals  in grazing  trials  to minimise  the effect  
of parasites.  More  intensive  dosing  in this situation  (every  17? weeks)  did not 
improve  lambs  growth  compared  with  dosing  at 3 week  intervals  and may only  
increase  the risk of worms  developing  resistance  to the drugs  used.
A guide  to pasture  heights  for sheep
Table  9 gives a  guide  to pasture  heights  for all sheep grazing  for set stocking  
and post-grazing  heights  for rotational  grazing  to achieve  high  lamb  growth  rates  
throughout  the season.

Agriculture  is an important  component  of the New Zealand  economy  where  
it accounts  for over  50%  of export  receipts. Grassland  based  farming,  producing  
animal  products  from  dairying,  sheep  and beef  account  for 36%,  30% and 20% 
of agricultural  export  receipts  respectively.  Many  comparisons  of agricultural  
production  in both Ireland  and New Zealand  have been made which  suggest  
that they are similar.  However,  closer  examination  of geography,  climate  and 
farming  systems  shows  that differences  do exist and that systems  of farming  
have developed  to cope  with the local constraints.  The main  aims of the present  
paper  are firstly  to generally  describe  agriculture  in New Zealand,  secondly  to 
describe  weather  and grass  growth  in the main  livestock  producing  regions  and 
thirdly  to describe  beef production  which  is mainly  based  on grazed  grass.
1. Agriculture  in New Zealand
Some  general  statistics  which  compare  New Zealand  and Ireland  are given  
in Table 1. It can be seen that New ^aland ’s land mass is nearly  four times  
the size of Ireland.  New Zealand  comprises  two main Islands,  with the North  
Island  accounting  for 43% of the land area (Figure  1). Both New Zealand  and 
Ireland  have  a similar  proportion  of their  areas  classified  as mountainous.  Again,  
both countries  have a similar  sized population  with rural/urban  balances  that 
are quite  alike.  The one big difference  between  the two countries  is in average  
farm size, which  in New Zealand  is 220 hectares  (540 acres)  compared  with 
25 hectares  (60 acres)  in Ireland.

Fig 1 - New Zealand  and Agricultural  Distribution
The North  Island  is the most  intensively  populated  and farmed  part of New  
Zealand  (Table  2). The majority  of New Zealand ’s dairy  cattle  (90%),  almost  
80% of the beef  cattle  and 50% of the sheep  numbers  are farmed  on the North  
Island.  Three  quarters  of New Zealand  people  live on the North  Island.
There  are approximately  4.5 million  beef cattle  in New Zealand  of which  
1.4 million  are breeding  cows and heifers.  Angus,  Hereford  and their crosses  
account  for 70% of beef cow breeds  (Table  3). Very few farmers  devote  
themselves  exclusively  to beef  production.  In general,  the raising  and finishing  
of beef is carried  on in conjunction  with sheep  farming.  The dairy sector  has 
a major  part to play in the New Zealand  beef industry.  Presently,  50% of beef 
is of dairy  origin.  Calving  in the beef  cow  herd  is planned  to coincide  with  spring  
grass  growth.  Grazed  grass  is the main diet throughout  the year  and while some  
limited  amounts  of hay or silage  may be offered,  no meal supplements  are fed. 
Winter  housing  of animals  is virtually  non-existent  in New Zealand.
Virtually  all animal production  systems  in New Zealand  are based on 
grassland,  either  grazed  or to a much  lesser  extent  conserved  as hay or silage. 
Clover  is the sward  component  that plays  a important  role in grassland  produc ­
tivity.  Clovers  are present  in nearly  all swards  and the use of fertiliser  nitrogen  
is limited.  However,  there is a renewed  interest  in nitrogen  use in autumn  and 
spring  to overcome  the sometimes  unreliable  productivity  of clovers  at these  
times  of the year. While  grass growth  patterns  vary with the season,  although

not to the same degree  as in Ireland,  is has resulted  in quite seasonal  animal

2. Weather  and grass growth  in New Zealand
New  Zealand  may simply  be described  as a “long narrow ” country  situated  
between  latitude  34° and 47° South  of the equator  and.at  approximately  165- 
180° East longitude.  For comparison  purposes,  its position  relative  to Ireland  
has been simplified  in Figure  2, where  New  Zealand  has been  moved  and placed  
at the same co-ordinates  North (of the equator)  as it occupies  South  of the 
equator.  From  this figure,  it can be  seen that the “North  Island ” coincides  mainly 
with central  and Southern  Spain.  The Auckland  region  would  be situated  close  
to Gibraltar  with  some  lands  stretching  as far South  as Morocco  in North  Africa. 
New Zealand's  capital  city, Wellington  which  is located  on the Southern  end 
of the North Island would now approximate  to Spains  capital,  Madrid.  The 
“South  Island ” would  stretch  from  the North  Spai  n/Portugal border  over  the Bay 
of Biscay  into the Atlantic  Ocean,  but would  not come as far North  as Brittany/  
Normandy  in France.  The nearest  regions  of New  Zealand  would be some  200- 
250 miles  South  of the Irish South  Coast.  Because  of its location  closer  to the
no
Ill
equator,  the sun is more  directly  overhead  than in Ireland.  This means that  solar  
radiation  is higher.  This is critical  for grass growth.
Because  New  Zealand  is a “narrow”  shaped  country,  its climate  is to a large  
extent  influenced  by the seas that surround  it. As a large  proportion  (approxi ­
mately  50%) of the South  Island  is covered  by mountains  (Southern  Alps),  this 
greatly  modifies  the climate.  The tall mountain  ranges  that run the entire  length  
of the South  Island  have  a large  influence  on both  rainfall  and temperature.  These  
influences,  as well as the fact that Ireland  is warmed  by the Gulf  stream,  makes  
the expected  differences  in climate  less than their relative  locations  in Figure  
2 might  suggest.
North  Island
Grass growth  data for the North Island are shown in Figures  3 and 4. 
Meteorological  data are shown  in Figures  6 and 7. For comparisons  the grass  
growth  curve  for Moorepark  is shown  and this site may be seen as one of the 
most  favourable  locations  in Ireland  for grass  production.  Seasonal distribution  
of grass growth  is shown  in Figure  8.
In general,  compared  with  Ireland,  grass  growth  rates  on New  Zealand's  North  
Island  are lower  in summer  and higher  in winter,  thus, giving  a more uniform  
seasonal  grass  supply.  In the Hamilton  region,  average  winter  grass  growth  rates  
are approximately  14 kg DM/ha/day.  Grass  growth  is at a minimum  in June/  
July (winter)  and increases  gradually  during  late July to reach  a peak of 50-60  
kg DM/ha/day  in September/October/November.  Growth  rates decrease  in 
January  (summer),  but seldom  fall below  20 kg DM/ha/day  until mid winter. 
Approximately  '/3 of the annual  grass production  takes place in winter  and 
autumn  (Figure  8). Rainfall  is relatively  high and well distributed  throughout  
the year. Average  winter  temperatures  (June/July/August)  are approximately  
9°C (Figure  6).
In the Palmerston  North region (Figure  4), winter,  summer  and autumn  
growth  rates are similar  at 20-24  kg DM/ha/day,  representing  over half of the 
season ’s grass  growth.  Grass  growth  reaches  a maximum  of approximately  70 
kg DM/ha/day  in October/  November.  Due to drought  effects  and the approach  
of autumn,  growth  rates can drop to less than 20 kg DM/ha/day,  but increase  
again during the winter. Winter  temperatures  average  8°C and rainfall  is 
generally  well distributed  throughout  the year.
Grass growth  occurs  in New Zealand ’s North  Island  throughout  the year. 
Winter  temperatures  (December,  January  and February)  at Moorepark  and 
Grange  average  5.2 °C and 4.4'^C,  respectively.  Corresponding  winter  (June, 
July and August)  temperature  in the Hamilton  region  is 9.2°C  and at Palmerston  
North  is 7.8°C.  Soil temperatures  closely  reflect  these  differences,  and there  is 
generally  no grass growth  at soil temperatures  less than 5 to 6°C. These  
differences  in temjreratures  result  in a more even supply  of grass throughout  
the year in New ^aland.  It can be clearly  seen in Figures  3 and 4 that New 
Zealand  have  an advantage  in terms  of grass  supply  in early spring  when  growth  
rates can be at least double  those  of Ireland.  During  the autumn.  New Zealand  
again has the advantage.  It is only during  the summer  months  that Ireland

produces  more  grass.  It is under  these  conditions,  favourable  to pastoral  farming,  
that most of New Zealand ’s cattle are farmed.
South  Island
The main grassland  based  farming  region  of the South  Island  is Southland,  
which  supports  a large  proportion  of New Zealand  sheep population.  A typical 
grass  growth  pattern  over the season  (Figure  5) shows  the growth  curve  for the 
Invermay  Research  Centre.  Grass  growth  rates during  June/July  (winter)  are 
typically  less than 10 kg DM/ha/day.  During  August,  growth  rates increase  to 
reach a peak in October  of about 60 kg DM/ha/day.  Growth  rates fall off 
gradually  during  November  through  to April when they reach approximately  
20 kg DM/ha/day.  Growth  rates during  May are typically  10 kg DM/ha/day.  
One third of the annual  grass growth  take place in autumn  and winter.  The 
remaining  seasons  production  in the spring  and summer  accounts  for 23 and 
47% of seasonal  growth  (Figure  8).
Temperatures  on the southerly  regions  of the South  Island  (Southland)  are 
more like those  of Ireland  than of the North  Island.  The January  equivalent  in 
Southland  has similar  temperatures  to Irish Southern  regions,  but is one degree  
centigrade  warmer  than for example  Grange.  During  the equivalent  month  of 
February  in New Zealand,  Southland  is 1-2°C  warmer  than Ireland.  When  this 
difference  means  temperatures  of 4 or 5°C in Ireland  compared  with  6°C in New 
Zealand,  it is of major  significance  for grass growth.  It in effect means  the

difference  between  grass growth  and no growth.  This is probably  best under ­
stood  if these  differences  are put into context.  February  1993 remains  clear in 
most peoples  minds as being a remarkably  mild month. The average  air 
temperature  during  February  1993 at Grange  was 6°C compared  with the more  
normal  4°C. This exceptional  Irish  February  is the normal  average  temperature  
in Southland  (which  in turn is inferior  to the North  Island  of New Zealand).  
Probably  in most  farmers ’ minds  if February  1993 was the normal,  then much  
more use would  be made of grazed  grass.
During  spring  (March  and April),  the differences  in temperature  between  
Ireland  and New  Zealand  become  greater.  The importance  of these  temperature  
differences  cannot  be overstated,  as growth  of grass is very sensitive  to tem­
perature  changes  at this time  of the year.  For  the remainder  of the year.  Southland  
temperatures  are similar  to those  of the Southern  part  of Ireland.  However,  grass

growth  in the autumn  is better  in Southland,  reflecting  the longer  days  and higher  
solar radiation  due to its closer  proximity  to the equator  than Ireland.
3. Beef production  in New Zealand
There  are approximately  30,000  beef  and sheep  farmers  in New  Zealand  that 
have  more  than 250 sheep  or 50 beef  cattle.  Less than  6,000  farmers  derive  their  
income  solely  from beef production.  Therefore,  in nearly  all situations,  beef 
cattle  and sheep  are farmed  as joint enterprises.  On the more  extensive  North  
Island  Hill country,  cattle  may account  for 25-30%  of the livestock  units  on the 
farm,  on better  lands  cattle  may  make  up 30-35%  of the stock.  While,  on average,  
beef  cattle  make  up 30%  of livestock  units  on the North  Island,  the corresponding  
figure  for the South  Island  is 5-15%.  While  the overall  average  farm  size in New  
Zealand  is 220 ha (540 acres),  those engaged  in drystock  farming  occupy  
holdings  that average  490 ha ( 1,200 acres).  Such a farm employs  1.6 labour  
units  (including  the farmer)  who  manage  on average  2,600  sheep  and 180 cattle.  
A “typical ” drystock  farm may comprise  25% flat land, 25% rolling  country  
and 50% steep  hill. These  farms  produce  lamb and beef  carcases  of 14 kg and 
250 kg, respectively.
The New Zealand  beef  industry  obtains  its raw materials  from two sources,  
the suckler  herd which  comprises  approximately  1.4 million cows  and the dairy  
herd  which  comprises  2.2 million  cows  of mainly  Friesian  and Friesian  x Jersey  
breeds.  Beef  produced  from the dairy herd is almost  exclusively  raised  as 15- 
22 month  bull beef, while steers are produced  from the suckler  herd.
Beef  cow breeds  are the traditional  Angus  (30%),  Hereford  (15%)  and their  
crosses  (25%)  (Table  3). Hereford  and Angus  sires  are the most  commonly  used 
bulls  in beef  production.  Calves  from  the dairy  herd,  mainly  males,  make  a major  
contribution  to the beef industry  (Table  4). The predominant  breeds  of cow in 
the dairy industry  are Friesian  (66%)  and Jersey (26%),  with Friesian  (and 
Jersey)  sires  widely  used.  Many  of the Jersey  male  calves  are slaughtered  shortly  
after birth.

managed  lowlands  to steep hill country.  Production  systems  thus vary, and 
depending  on price  and herbage  supply  selling  dates  may vary widely  between  
years.
High  hill country:  Most  cows  are mated  to Hereford  or Angus  sires;  terminal  
sires such as the Charolais  or Simmental  would  account  for less than 10% of 
matings.  Very  few farmers  would  mate  all cows  to terminal  sires.  Selling  patterns  
vary widely.  Some  or all of the weanlings  may  be sold before  winter  where the 
buyer is normally  farming  on better lowlands.  Some producers  carry their  
progeny  over  the winter  and may sell in spring  when  prices  are normally  highest  
yet others may wait until late spring/summer  and sell at heavier  weights.  
Generally,  animals  are not finished  on the high hill country.  Suckler  cow herd 
size on the hill country  is typically  70-90  cows.
Easier  (gently  rolling)  hill country:  Suckler  cows,  again,  with sheep  are 
farmed  on these  more  easily  managed  hills and are often  managed  with another  
drystock  enterprise.  These  drystock  may be steers  or surplus  females  from  the 
high hill country  or may be bulls bought  from the dairy industry.  Heifers  are 
finished  at 15-18  months  of age while  bulls  are sold  at 18-22  months  with  carcase  
weights  of approximately  280 kg.
Good  flatlands:  While  sheep  are again  farmed,  the beef  enterprise  tends  to 
be specialised.  Producing  bull beef  or finishing  steers  purchased  from the hill 
country  is common.
Some  typical  cow  weights  during  the year  are shown  in Table  5 and are lower  
than those  on most Irish farms.  At weaning  time a bodyweight  of 450 kg for 
Angus  or Hereford  cows  is common.  Between  weaning  and mid/late  winter  cows  
may lose up to 10-15%  of their  bodyweight.  On many  farms  cows  at this  stage  
of the production  cycle are used as pasture  cleaners  where  they are offered  
whatever  herbage  is remaining  after  the ewe flock,  especially  during  the mating  
season.  During  the winter  pregnant  ewes and cows  are seen  as the least  sensitive  
animals  to changes  in herbage  supply  as growing  stock (lambs/hoggets  and 
weanlings/yearlings)  are offered  first choice  of pasture.  Weight  losses  of the

order  of 10-15%  are seen as reasonable  provided  it takes  place  before  4 weeks  
pre calving.  Bodyweights  at calving  for the Angus  and Hereford  type cows  are 
normally  in the range  440-480  kg. After  calving  cows  are gradually  introduced  
to spring  grass and over the first 4 weeks  of lactation  cow bodyweights  may 
be reduced  to 400 kg. As grass  growth  improves  (spring-September  to Novem ­
ber) bodyweight  recovers  and will reach  a peak in December/January.  Mating  
takes place  during  November/December  when the cows are on an increasing  
plane  of nutrition.  Weaning  takes  place  in February/March.  Both  cows  and ewes  
are normally  set stocked  during  spring/summer.  Calf weights  at weaning  are 
in the range  200-250  kg.
Bull beef production
Of all the beef  production  systems  practised  in New Zealand,  finishing  bull 
calves  from the dairy herd is the most clearly  defined  and managed  system.  
Production  of steer  beef,  from  the suckler  herd,  is less well  defined  and somewhat  
like Ireland  involves  a fair degree  of animal  movement  between  farms  during  
the animals  lifetime.  The bull beef system  involves  raising  bulls (Friesian)  
purchased in October  (spring)  at weights  ranging  from 85 to 100 kg and feeding  
outdoors  on grass until they are 15-22 months  old, producing  carcases  in the 
weight  range  230-280  kg. Bulls  are managed  in groups  of20-40  and are generally
119
set stocked  during  summer  and rotationally  grazed  during  winter.  Management  
problems  in relation  to animal  behaviour  are not seen as an important  issue.  
Animal  stocking  rates on these bull beef systems  are usually  less than 3 to 4 
bull/ha  (1.5/acre).  Performance  is closely  associated  with grass supply  and on 
bull finishing  units regular  assessments  of pasture  cover/mass  are made.
The effect  of stocking  rate on liveweight  gain is shown  in Figure  9. Stocking  
bulls at 5 to 6/ha over the year resulted  in little gain during  the winter  month  
(April-September)  when  animals  were 150-200  kg at the beginning  of winter. 
At 6 bulls/ha  animals  maintained  liveweight  and at 5 bulls/ha  gained  approxi ­
mately  25 kg. During  the winter  period  bulls stocked  at 4/ha gained  0.2 kg/ 
head/day  while  those stocked  at 3/ha achieved  a gain of 0.5 kg/head/day.  To 
achieve  satisfactory  lifetime  gains bulls are therefore  stocked  at 3/ha or less. 
An example  of a typical  bull beef  unit is the 105 ha (260 acres)  farm  at Massey  
University.  The unit is made up of 31 paddocks  ranging  in size from 1.3 to 
6.1 ha (3 to 15 acres)  based on a permanent  ryegrass/white  clover  mixture.  
Rainfall  is about  1000  mm (40 inches)  and  is evenly  spread  throughout  the year. 
Nitrogen  may be used in the autumn  (April)  and in 1990 it represented  20 kg 
N/ha  in the form  of urea. In autumn  1991,40  kg N/ha  was applied  with  a further  
22 kg N/ha in July (late winter).  Friesian  bull calves  are purchased  during  
October/November  (Table  6), and prices  have  ranged  from  $120  to $303 (£60- 
£150).  Bulls  are sold during  December  to March  at 15-20  months  of age (Table  
7). The disposal  pattern  for the 1991/92  production  season  is shown  in Table  
8. During  the years  1983/84  to 1987/88  where  bulls  were  stocked  at 3/ha  average  
carcase  weight  was 223 kg. But when  stocking  rates were reduced  to 2.5 bulls/  
ha during  the years 1988/89  to 1991/92  average  carcase  weight  increased  to 
254 kg and has been  increasing  yearly.  During  the corresponding  periods  carcase  
output  had declined  from 723 to 670 kg/ha,  but price per head had increased  
from NZ$444  to NZ$692.

Herbage  supply  has a major  influence  on the growth  rate of bulls within  the 
system  as can be seen from Figures  9,10 and 11. The production  year 1986/  
87 (Table  7) was characterised  by a low herbage  mass which  for most of the 
year  was less than 1,400  kg DM/ha  (Figure  10). Animal  performance  was poor  
(Figure  10 and Table  7) and carcase  weights  averaged  208 kg. The following  
year (1987/88)  the weather  pattern  resulted  in herbage  production  that was 
improved  and pasture  mass was seldom  less than 1,400 kg DM/ha.  Animal  
performance  was greatly  improved  and carcase  weights  were increased  by 25 
kg/head.

Seasonality  of production
Although  grassland  is grazed  throughout  the year,  there  is nevertheless  a clear  
seasonality  to beef  production.  The slaughtering  at export  plants  over the year 
is shown  in Figure  12. Data for Ireland  are shown  for comparison.  A smaller  
proportion  of the New Zealand  kill of steers  and heifers  takes place  in winter  
than in Ireland.  Peak  killing  takes  place  in late summer  and autumn.  The ratio 
between  the minimum  and maximum  kill is at least as wide as observed  in 
Ireland.  The seasonality  of production  is to a large  extent  a reflection  of (a) the 
seasonality  of calving  where  virtually  all beef  cows  calf  in spring  at the beginning  
of the grass growth  period  and (b) the production  of beef from grazed  grass.
Conclusions
There  are similarities  between  Ireland  and New Zealand  in factors  such as 
the importance  of grassland  for animal production,  the contribution  of the dairy

industry  to beef  production  and the fact that agricultural  production  in general  
is seasonal.  There  are however,  differences  that make direct  extrapolation  of 
New Zealand  production  practices  to Ireland  more difficult.  Chiefly  among  
those  is climate.  The North  Island  of New  Zealand  where  90%  of the dairy  cows  
and almost  80% of beef animals  are farmed  does have a warmer  climate  than 
Ireland.  Grass  growth  does take place  all year round  with winter  growth  rates  
generally  greater  than 10-15 kg DM/ha/day.
Average  farm and herd size in New Zealand  is much  larger  than in Ireland.  
Dairy  herds approximate  to 170 cows/farm,  likewise,  suckler  herd size is 60- 
100 cows  on North  Island  hill country.  Clearly  economics  of scale  are important  
when comparing  those  enterprise  between  Ireland  and New Zealand.
Soil on the New  Zealand  hills are quite  different  from  those  of Ireland.  North  
Island  soils are largely  influenced  by volanic  activity  and many  of these  soils 
where  adequately  fertilised  are quite  productive.  In an Irish context,  such hill 
soil would  be seen as good mineral  soils.
Beef  production  is derived  from two sources,  the national  suckler  herd and 
the male  progeny  of the dairy herd. Steer  beef  is produced  from  the suckler  herd 
while  bull beef slaughtered  at 15-22  months  of age is almost  exclusively  from 
the dairy herd.

Animal  production  in New Zealand  involving  dairying,  sheep  and beef on 
grazed  grass  accounts  for 85%  of agricultural  receipts. Many  comparisons  have  
been made  of agricultural  production  in both Ireland  and New Zealand  which  
suggest  that they are similar.  However,  closer examination  of geography,  
climate  and farming  systems  reveal  differences  and show  that  systems  of farming  
have developed  independently  to cope with local constraints.
The  present  report  presents  information  on a number  of areas  relating  to sheep  
production  in NZ. Firstly,  reference  is made  to grass growth.  Secondly,  sheep  
production  which  is totally  grass based is described.  Thirdly,  some research  
developments  of relevance  to current  practices  in Ireland  are outlined.
Grass  growth  and weather
New  Zealands  location south  of the equator  approximates  to Spain's  position  
north  of the equator.  However,  because  of New ^aland's  location  in the south  
seas and its own geography,  climate  is modified  and varies  with location.  The 
North  Island  has average  temperatures  that are 3 to 5°C warmer  than Ireland  
and soil temperature  in the main grassland  regions  seldom falls below 6 to 8°C. 
The threshold  temperature  for grass growth  is 6°C. Thus grass grows  all year 
round  and on the North  Island  grass growth  seldom  falls below 10 kg DM/  
hectare/day.
Details  on the characteristics  of grass  growth  in NZ are described  separately  
by E. G. O’Riordan  in this Journal  (see Beef  Production  From New Zealand  
Grasslands).  Grass growth  rates throughout  the year do not show the large  
fluctuations  as observed  in Ireland.  While  the climate  on the southern  end of 
the South  Island  is more  similar  to Ireland  it nevertheless  has more  favourable  
grass growth  in spring  and autumn/winter.
Drop in sheep  numbers
NZ’s land  area  is nearly  4 times  the size  of Ireland.  Of a total  area  of 26 million  
ha, about  13m ha is in pastoral  land  with  two-thirds  of the livestock  units  carried  
on lowland  or rolling  terrain,  one-third  in the hill country  and l%-2%  on the 
high country.  About  40% of land is classed  as hill.
The total sheep  population  in 1992 was 52.5 million,  with a decline  of 18% 
since 1987. Relatively  poor returns  from sheepmeat,  wool and skins are con­
tributing  to the decline  in sheep  numbers.  In the South  Island  there have been 
sheep  farm  conversions  to dairying.  Herd  owners  and share  milkers  have  moved  
down  from  the North  Island  to develop  and establish  large  dairy  farm  enterprises

(300-500  cows).  This pattern  has been stimulated  by lower  land prices  on the 
South  Is., by the profit  margins  in milk and by confidence  in a secure  market.  
There  were 300 dairy farm conversions  up to 1993 with a further  140 planned  
at the time.
Lamb  prices
Table 1 shows  the schedule  prices  for lamb.  Carcass  weights  are typically  
from 12.5 kg to 16 kg at 14-18  weeks of age. Lamb  prices  in 1992/93  averaged  
IR£13  per head with the tops making  IRE  17.
Sheep  and goat meat  production  is 585,000  tonnes  carcass  weight  equivalent  
of which  460,000  tonnes  are exported.
Labour
Table  2 shows  the number  of flocks  classified  by size. Labour  units  per farm  
are often 1.5 to 2.0 on the larger  hill farms  but it is cbmmon  for many  owners/  
operators  to manage  3500 stock units on their own (one stock unit = one 55 
kg breeding  ewe), with the use of a motor  cycle and dogs for mustering  and 
family  assistance  for seasonal  work. -  ’'
On the majority  of NZ farms,  sheep  and beef  production  take place  together.  
Traditionally,  in relation  to drystock,  NZ is a sheep  producing  country.  On most  
North  Island  farms  beef  cattle  (suckler  cows)  account  for less than 35% of the 
livestock  units.  Very  few farms  have  beef  as the only  enterprise.  The proportions  
of sheep  and cows,  in conjunction  with the age and weight  of cattle  at sale, are 
largely  influenced  by the amount  of good  lowland,  easily  managed  hill and steep  
hills on the farms.

Low costs
Primary  production  of meat and wool is the mainstay  of the NZ sheep  
industry.  Production  per ha remains  a basic  principle  for maximising  whole  farm  
profitability.  Low cost sheep  grazing  systems  were developed  to enable  NZ 
farmers  to survive  on returns  from  the international  market  place.  The efficient  
matching  of pasture  feed supply with seasonal  feed demand  using proven  
techniques  of grazing  management  and control  of internal  parasites  is a key 
management  principle.  These  principles  contribute  significantly  to the manage ­
ment  of long term production  and profit  and to the management  of long term 
risk.
Low cost is a key principle  and sheep  systems  are essentially  low input.  The 
concept  of grazed grass as the sole diet together  with economy  of scale  
predominates.  Typically  the main inputs  are aimed  at labour  efficiency.  (1) A 
4-wheeled  motor  bike; (2) Trained  dogs; (3) Fencing;  (4) Easy care ewes that 
receive  no attention  at lambing;  (5) Wool  shed  and handling  pens.  Without  these  
inputs  it would  be impossible  to farm much  of the land. Machinery  and farm  
buildings  are noticeable  by their absence.  Fertilizer  N is not used.
Lamb  finishing  farms
These  farms  are often in the 100-300  ha range  and carry stocking  rates of 
16 to 18 stock units per ha in the very fertile  areas of the North  Is. and 10 to 
20 stock units per ha in Southland,  one of the most densely  populated  sheep  
areas in NZ. Sources  of supply  for stock in the North  Is. are the hill country  
for young  or cast for age Romney  ewes and weaner  steers  and dairy farms  for 
Friesian  and cross-bred  bulls.
A typical  South  Is. intensive  meat  and wool producing  farm is about  200 ha 
in size, of undulating  topography  and responsive  to lime and fertilisers  contain ­
ing molybdenum,  phosphorus  and sulphur.  Stock  consists  of about  2000  ewes,
127
650 ewe hoggets,  40 rams  and 50 to 70 beef  cattle.  Hence,  with a total of about  
2900 stock units, the farm is stocked  at the rate of 14 stock units per ha.
Lambing  percentage  is 125%.  The  flock  is set stocked  until  weaning;  weaning  
weight  is 25 kg. After  weaning,  lambs  are divided  into forward,  medium  and 
light  groups  and grazed  on hay or silage  aftermaths  or chicory,  a specially  sown 
crop which  is resistant  to drought.  Lamb  growth  rate is 200 g/day.  Lambs  are 
drafted  at 3-week  intervals  at 35-40  kg liveweight.  Average  carcass  weight  is 
16 kg.
Clover
White  clover  has traditionally  been the king pin of NZ grazing  systems.  Its 
high digestibility  characteristics  combined  with a high protein  content  ensures  
better  lamb growth  rates than all-grass  swards,  i.e. 320 g/day and 275 g/day  
respectively  according  to results  at Lincoln  College,  Canterbury.  Moreover,  
there are relatively  large differences  in gut fill and killing-out  percentage  in 
favour  of lambs  finished  off clover  swards.  A new variety  “Demand ” has been  
developed  which  produces  significant  growth  in the NZ winter.
Direct  drilling  has proved  to be an effective  method  for replacing  clover  in 
existing  pastures  which  have deteriorated  over time. Special  inverted  T drill 
openers  have  been  developed.  The  critical  points  of management  for the success  
of the technique  are:
1. Remove  competition  from  grasses  by overall  or band spraying  depending  
on the condition  of the existing  pasture.
2. Control  the depth  of sowing;  1-1 ‘/2 cm is ideal.
3. Do not sow clover  at less than 10°C
4. Control  pests and grubs with insecticides  and slug pellets.
5. Graze  regularly  during  the first  6 months  to prevent  clover  suppression  from  
tall grass.
Grass  budgeting
Otago-Southland  at the southern  end of the South  Is. is one  of the most  densely  
populated  sheep  areas of NZ producing  about  40% of NZ’s export  lamb.  The 
region is characterised  by long cold winters  and cool moist summers.  The 
traditional  winter  feeding  systems  based on hay and basic crops have been 
replaced  during  the past 20 years  by grazed grass.  An all-grass  farming  concept  
was developed  from research  investigation  into rotation  lengths,  autumn  saved  
pasture  and the effects  of trampling.  Grass  feed rationing,  increased  stocking  
rates and lambing  percentages  using  grass  budgeting  and electric  fencing  have 
benefited  farmers  through  lower  winter  feed costs.  Over  a 95 day winter,  sheep  
are grazed  at the rate of 250 ewes per ha in daily shifts.
Hill country
Some 8000 of the 21,300  sheep/beef  farms with over 750 stock units are 
classified  as hill country.  About  85% of them  are situated  in the North Is., 400-  
700 ha in size and carry 8 to 10 stock units per ha. Cattle  ratios  are generally
128
1 beast  to 10 sheep.  It is common  for an owner/operator  to run  3500  stock  units  
on his own. Electric  fencing  is widely  used and many 400 ha farms have  
increased  the number  of paddocks  from 30 to 60, giving  better  control  and 
utilisation  of pasture.
South  Island  hill country  farms  are larger,  up to 1700 ha. Fine wool sheep  
breeds  are run at 3-4 stock units per ha.
High country  farms
These  are situated  at higher  altitudes  in the South  Is. with extensive  tussock  
grassland  grazing  and are subject  to severe  weather  hazards.  They  occupy  15% 
of NZ farmland;  average  size is 11,000  ha and flock  size is 8000  sheep.  Rainfall  
varies  from  250 mm in Otago  to 10,000  mm in the Main  Divide.  Wool  provides  
60-70%  of the income  with store stock  sold. Stocking  rates vary from 1 sheep  
per 1.5 ha to 1 sheep  per 4 ha.
Easy care ewes
The most popular  breed is the Romney,  an English  breed, but further  
developed  in NZ as a dual purpose  breed  for both meat and wool production.  
It has been cross-bred  with the coarser  wooled  Border  Leicester  from which  
the Coopworth  has been developed  for higher  fertility,  meat  and wool produc ­
tion. Research  and development  on this breed  at Lincoln  College,  Canterbury  
includes a  sire reference  scheme  using A.l. and laparoscopy  and 30 cooperating  
breeders.  Selection  pressure  is intense  for fertility,  growth  rate and clean  fleece  
weight;  only 2 sires are selected  from a recorded  pool of 350-400  sires.
Easy care means  that ewes lamb  down  unassisted  - there is no intervention  
by the stockman.  Selection  for this trait has been on-going  for many  years  and 
has resulted  in improvements  in mothering  ability.  The Coopworth  is an 
example.
The Perindale  (Romney  x Cheviot)  is another  crossbred  type developed  to 
suit local conditions.  It is hardier  than the  Romney,  bred for survival  in the high 
country  and has ‘easy care ’ attributes.
Most  flocks  are self-contained  with up to 50% of the ewes  being  mated  with 
sires of their  own  breed  and the remainder  with terminal  sires such as Suffolk,  
Hampshire  Down  or Texel.
Responses  to removal  of subsidies
The removal  of subsidies  in the mid 80’s forced  farmers  to change  their 
management  policies  in order  to maintain  farm viability.  All non-production  
costs were terminated  e.g. chemical  sprays  (‘some  Jobs  just were not done ’). 
Fixed  costs and machinery  expenditure  were severely  curtailed.  Hired  labour  
was terminated.
Some  farms  had insufficient  units of production,  hectares  of land or stock  
numbers  to maintain  profitability  under  the existing  cost structure;  some  farms  
were over capitalised.  As a result  there has been considerable  restructuring  in 
terms  of farm size. It is now considered  that an economically  viable  hill farm 
for one labour  unit is 400 ha compared  with 100 ha 20 years ago.
129
There  was also  a sharp  re-focus  on choice  of expenditure  for the best  financial  
returns.  Policy  changes  on the farm involved:  (i) reduction  in sheep  numbers  
in order  to improve  the quality  of the remainder;  (2) increase  in cattle  numbers  
and a greater  proportion  of young  stock  finished  on the farm;  (3) introduction  
of a bull beef enterprise  on some farms  to increase  whole  farm profitability;
(4) diversification  into forestry,  deer or fruit enterprises.
Lean meat growth-measurement  service
The meat  processing  industry  in NZ requires  heavier,  leaner  lamb.  Farmers  
have used husbandry  and management  methods  to partially  meet the market  
requirements  but presently  well designed  breeding  programmes  will provide  
superior  rams to lamb  producers.  The result  of this research  is an index  which  
incorporates  liveweight,  fat depth  and muscle  depth.  An index  value  is calculated  
for each animal.  The index  values  of individual  animals  together  with fat and 
muscle  depths  are returned  to breeders  in a ranking  list to assist  with selection  
and sale.  By using  the animals  with  the highest  values  within  the breeder ’s flock,  
the breeder  makes  genetic  progress  for lean meat growth.
Resistance  to anthelmintics
The desire  to eliminate  worm  drenching  in NZ flocks  arises,  not because  of 
the cost but because  of the emergence  of resistance  to anthelmintics.  Moreover  
there is increasing  consumer  concern  regarding  chemical  residues  in food.
Regular  drenching  at 3-week  intervals  post-weaning  is considered  in NZ to 
be a strong contributory  factor to the development  of resistance  in worm 
parasites.  Similar  trends  have  been  observed  in the U.K. New  Zealand  research ­
ers are attempting  to develop  new  sheep  production  systems  aimed  at eliminating  
the need  for drenching  by: (1) using  sheep  that are genetically  selected  for worm 
parasite  resistance  and, (2) using  grazing  methods  that minimise  worm  larvae  
ingestion.
This twin pronged  approach  embraces  both breeding  and management  
strategies.  The sheep  breeding  trials involve  progeny  testing  and selection  of 
Romney  breeding  stock  for low faecal  egg output  of Haemonchus,  Ostertagia,  
Trichostrongyloids  and Nematodirus  species.  Faecal  samples  from  the progeny  
of rams selected  for resistance  or non-resistance  are examined  on a monthly  
basis.  The resistant  sheep  have  relatively  low faecal egg  output.  The heritability  
of worm  resistance  has been estimated  at 33%.
But without  suitable  grazing  management  the worm  challenge  is still high. 
Incompatibility  between  sheep and cattle nematodes  is being exploited  by 
introducing  cattle  to the grazing  rotation  in order  to reduce  larval  ingestion  by 
sheep.  In this way, it is considered  that the worm  parasite  cycle  for sheep  can 
be broken.  From  lambing  until weaning  at 12 weeks  of age, cattle  are grazed  
on part of the farm, with the ewes plus lambs  grazing  behind  them in a leader/  
follower  fashion.  After  weaning,  the lambs  are transferred  to fresh pasture  on 
the remainder  of the farm.
Fig. 1 shows  the results  of a trial in which  equal numbers  of lambs  sired by 
resistant  and non-resistant  rams were managed  together  in the same grazing

system.  In the early  part of the sheep production  year  there  was little difference  
between  the two categories  of lambs  either  in faecal  egg count  or in liveweight  
gain, because  the pasture  was relatively  clean. After weaning  in February,  
however,  non-resistant  lambs  had up to 2000  eggs  per gram  compared  with  under  
500 eggs in resistant  lambs.  As a result,  the liveweight  gains of non-resistant  
lambs  declined  whereas  resistant  lambs  continued  to thrive.  The non-resistant  
lambs  were eventually  drenched  for welfare  reasons.
As there are no new types of worm  drenches  on the horizon  this research  
will be watched  with interest.

Introduction
The purpose  of my visit to New Zealand  in February  1993 was threefold;-
(1) To attend  the XVII  International  Grassland  Congress  which  was held at 
Massey  University,  Palmerston  North  and subsequently  at Hamilton.
(2) To visit  research  organisations  and university  faculties  engaged  in research  
on grassland  and animal  production,  particularly  dairying.
(3) To visit dairy farms in the North and South  Islands  and observe  New  
Zealand  grassland  farming  in practice.
International  Grassland  Congress
There  was  a large  attendance  (1400) at the Congress  from all over  the world.  
The main theme  of the Congress  was sustainable  animal  production  from the 
grasslands  of the world. The grassland  systems  discussed  varied widely  in 
nature,  e.g. intensive  temperate  grassland,  arid/semi-arid  zones,  distinct  wet/dry  
zones, humid  subtropical/tropical  zones, winter  cold temperate  rangelands.  
Separate  sessions  dealt  with  various  aspects  of grassland  production  and utilisa ­
tion, e.g. plant growth  and physiology,  plant breeding,  nutrition,  pests and 
diseases,  nutritive  value of forages,  grassland  management,  utilisation  and 
animal  production  systems.  In the underdeveloped  countries  the main concern  
was to sustain  viable  systems  of grassland  farming  against  a background  of an 
expansion  in population  and climatic  changes. In the developed  countries  where  
intensive  production  is practised  concern  was focussed  on the detrimental  effects  
on the environment  and the high  reliance  of inputs  from outside  the system,  e.g. 
nitrogen  fertiliser,  fossil fuel, imported  feeds and irrigation  to sustain  high 
levels  of production  in an era when many of these countries  are more than 
self-sufficient  in the main products  of grassland,  i.e. dairy produce,  meat and 
fibre.
Animal  production  from  most  grassland  systems  in the world  is low due to the 
extensive  systems  of grazing  adopted  to maintain  the systems  and the high  cost 
or impracticability  of using inputs,  e.g. fertiliser  or supplementary  feed. High  
levels  of production  from  grassland  are mainly associated  with the temperate  or 
continental  grassland  zones  of the developed  world,  e.g. North  West Europe,  
South East Australia,  New Zealand,  East Coast and Mid-West  of U.S.A.  
However,  much  of this production  is dependent  on feeds  other  than grass,  e.g. 
maize,  sorghum,  cereal  grains,  lucerne  and fodder  crops,  often  constituting  more  
than  half  of the animal ’s diet. Ireland  and New  Zealand  are the only  two  countries  
where intensive  animal  production  systems  are largely  based on grassland.  
Intensive  animal  production  mainly  from grassland  is the exception  rather  than 
the rule on a worldwide  scale.

Weather  and grass  growth  in New Zealand
New  Zealand  is located  about  1600  km east  of Southern  Australia  between  34- 
47° south of the equator  and is therefore  much  more favourably  located  than 
Ireland  (51-56°N)  in terms  of solar  radiation  and winter  temperature.  Aspects  of 
weather  and  grass  growth  in New  Zealand  are dealt  with  in detail  in another  paper  
in this proceedings  (E. G. O’Riordan,  Grange)  and only  will be outlined  briefly  
in this paper.  The total sunshine  hours/annum  range  from 1600-2100  hrs in New  
Zealand  (Southlands  - Auckland)  compared  with a range  of 1200-1500  hrs in 
Ireland.  Mean  daily  air temperature  in the North  Island  (Hamilton  and Palmerston  
North)  range  from  8-9°C in winter  (June-August)  to 17-19°C  in summer  (Dec.-  
Feb.)  compared  with  5°C  in winter  (Dec.-Feb.)  and 14°C  in summer  (June-Aug.)  
at Moorepark.  In the Southlands,  i.e. the southern  part  of the South  Island,  which  
most  resembles  Ireland  climatically,  temperatures  in spring  and early summer  
are 1-2°C  higher  than at Moorepark  and consequently  is more favourable  for 
early spring grass growth.  During  late summer,  autumn  and early winter  
temperatures  at Southland  are similar  to Moorepark  but the duration  of sunshine  
is significantly  higher  at Southland  (Fig. 1).
The distribution  of rainfall  in New Zealand  is very much  influenced  by the 
mountainy  terrain  in the centre  of the North  Island  and the Southern  Alps  running  
along  the entire  length  of the South  Island.  Rain-bearing  South  westerly  winds  
blowing  in from  the Tasman  sea provide  a good distribution  of rain, i.e. 1000-  
1200 mm (40-50  ins) in the western  part of the North  Island,  except  in mid­
summer  in inland  areas,  whereas  the eastern  areas  (Hawkes  Bay) receive  5(X)- 
700 mm (20-30  ins) and are very dry in summer.  In the South  Island  rainfall  is 
extremely  variable  between  the west and east coast. The west coast area 
(Westland)  receives  a very  high  rainfall  of2500-4000  mm (100-150  ins) whereas  
the east coast  (Canterbury  and Otago)  which  are sheltered  by the Alps receive  
very  little,  particularly  in inland  areas,  i.e. 400-800  mm (15-30  ins) and is usually  
subject  to a prolonged  summer  drought.  The Southlands  area which is not 
sheltered  by the Alps  receives  a higher  rainfall  of about  1000  mm (40 ins),  similar  
to the South  of Ireland.
Due to the higher  temperature  and solar  radiation  the pattern  of grass  growth  
in New  Zealand  is much more  uniform  than in Ireland.  In the North  Island grass  
growth  in winter  is in the range  of 15-20  kg DM/ha  and rises  gradually  to a peak  
of 50-70  kg DM/ha  by early  summer  (October/November).  Grass  growth  often  
declines  to 20-30  kg DM/ha  due  to midsummer  drought  and rises  again  in autumn  
to 30  kg DM/ha.  This  pattern  is in marked  contrast  to the pattern  of grass  growth  
in Ireland,  e.g. Moorepark  which is characterised  by little  growth  in winter  (5 kg 
DM/ha)  until early March,  followed  by rapid growth  to a peak of 100-120  kg 
DM/ha  in May and a steady  decline  thereafter  to less than 20 kg DM/ha  in 
October/November  (See Figs.  3-4 in E. O’Riordan ’s paper).  In terms of animal  
feed requirements  there  is therefore  far less need  or scope  for grass  conservation  
as hay or silage  in late spring/early  summer  in the North  Island  of New  Zealand  
and less need for winter  feed compared  with Ireland.  In the south  of the South  
Island  the pattern  of grass  growth  at Invermay  (near  Dunedin)  is slower  in spring,  
rising  to a peak  of 60 kg DM/ha  in October,  declines  steadily  to about  20 kg DM/

ha in autumn  (April)  and to less than 10 kg DM/ha  in winter. Thus  grass growth  
in the South  Island  is fairly  similar  to Moorepark  in winter  but is much  earlier  in 
spring and doesn ’t produce  as much growth  in summer  (See Fig. 5 in E. 
O’Riordan ’s paper).  There  is considerable  variation  in the amount  and pattern  of 
grass  growth  in New Zealand  due to location  and the wide  variation  in rainfall  
(Fig. 2). Sustained  levels  of grass  growth  are achieved  from September  to April  
in areas  which  receive  adequate  rainfall  in summer,  e.g. Northlands  and Southlands 
whereas  in the dry areas,  e.g. Canterbury  and Otago  summer  growth  can be poor  
and variable.  Irrigation  is practised  on many dairy farms  in the Canterbury  area 
to ensure  grass  growth.  Conserved  grass  in the form  of hay/silage  or bought-in  
feed is used as much  to supplement  poor  pasture  growth  in mid summer  in the 
drier  areas  as it is for supplementing  winter  pasture.
Milk  production  in New Zealand
Most  of the livestock  in New  Zealand  are located  in the North  Island,  i.e. 90% 
of the dairy  cattle,  80% of the beef  cattle  and 50% of the sheep.  Three-quarters  
of the people  also live there.  Consequently,  from an agricultural  and economic  
perspective  the North  Island  is by far the most  important.  There  are 14,500  dairy  
farms in New Zealand  and three-quarters  (77%)  of those are located  on the 
western  side of the North  Island,  i.e. Northlands,  Waikato  and Tarinaki.  The 
biggest  concentration  of dairy  farmers  (6,300  - 45%)  occur  in the Waikato  area. 
There  are only 1,200  dairy  farms  (9%)  in the South  Island.  These  are located  in 
three  main  areas,  i.e. Westland/Nelson  area  (620),  Canterbury  (280)  and Southland  
(300).  However,  the number  of dairy  farmers  in the South  Island  is growing  as 
more  dairy  farmers  and sharemilkers  move  south  to either  start  up or expand  their  
operation  with larger  herds,  due to the cheaper  price  of land.
The number  of dairy  farms  has declined  from 18,500  in 1974/75  while  cow 
numbers  have increased  from 2.08 to 2.44 million  (Table  1) resulting  in an 
increase  of 43% in the amount  of milk  delivered  for processing.  This  represents  
96%  of all milk  produced.  The average  herd  size is 170 cows,  producing  157 kg 
milk  fat/cow  (=930  gls at 3.6%  fat) at a stocking  rate of 2.4 cows/ha.  Herd size 
and milk fat production  per cow and per hectare  have increased  progressively  
over the last 20 years (Table  2). There is considerable  emphasis  on milk 
recording  and currently  60% of herds involving  66% of all cows are milk-

recorded.  This level has increased  progressively  over the years except  for a 
period  in the late 80’s. Milk  production  per cow in recorded  herds has increased  
from 1970/71  but only to a small  extent  since 1980/81  (Table  3). This may be a 
reflection  of a dilution  effect  by the increasing  numbers  of herds  of average  or 
below  average  production  which  are now being  tested.  Milk  fat composition  is 
quite  high (4.8%)  and has  changed  little  over  the years,  possibly  due to a change  
in breeding  policy  from  Jerseys  to Friesians.  Milk  protein  content  is high  at 3.7%.
Over half of the recorded  cows are Friesian  (53%)  while Jerseys  (21%),  
crossbred  Friesian  x Jersey  cows  (12%)  and other  breeds,  mainly  Ayrshire  and 
Shorthorn  (14%)  represent  the main  breed  types  (Table  4). The highest  concen-

tration  of Jersey  cows  and crossbreds  (48%)  are found  in the Taranaki  area,  while  
the highest  concentration  of Friesians  occur  in the South  Island.  In these  herds  
the average  lactation  length  is similar  for the different  breeds  (226 days).  The 
Friesians  produce  more milk than the Jerseys  but of a lower  fat and protein  
content  while  the crossbred  cows  are intermediate  (Table  5). However,  the three  
breed  types  produce  a similar  yield of milk  fat while  protein  yield  is less for the 
Jerseys.  The fat and protein  composition  of the Friesian  cows is quite high by 
Irish standards  and may be a reflection  of a Jersey  ancestry  coupled  with a 
breeding  policy  to improve  fat content  over the past 30 years. Milk protein  
content  is becoming  of increasing  importance  and in that  regard  the fat to protein  
ratio  of milk  is better  for Friesians  (0.78)  than  for Jerseys  (0.72)  or the crossbred  
cows (0.75).
Milk  processing  for export
The pattern  of milk  production  is even more  seasonal  in New  2^aland  than in 
Ireland.  Virtually  no milk is produced  in the winter  months  of June/July  other  
than for the liquid  trade.  Milk  processing  rises to a peak in October/November,  
i.e. 50 million  kg milk fat/month  and declines  gradually  thereafter.  Milk is 
processed  by 16 co-operatives,  5 large  and 11 small  cooperatives,  9 of which  are 
located  in the South  Island.  Over  7 million  tonnes  of milk  is processed  annually.  
The main dairy products  are butter,  milk powder,  cheese,  casein and food  
ingredients.  About  80% of dairy  products  are exported  exclusively  through  the 
New  Zealand  Dairy Board  which  has a number  of subsidiary  companies  located  
around  the world.  New Zealand  accounts  for only a small  proportion  (1.5%)  of 
total world  milk production.  Nevertheless  its exports  of dairy produce,  which  
represent  only 1.2% of world  milk production,  accounts  for about  25% of the 
world  market  trade, which  is dominated  by the European  Union  and U.S.A.  
International  trade in dairy produce  accounts  for only a small  fraction  (5%) of 
world  milk production.
The New Zealand  Dairy  Board,  which  is farmer  owned,  controls  all exports  
of dairy  produce,  co-ordinates  the type  of product  required  for foreign  markets  
and determines  the direction  of research  and development  into new products  for 
these  markets.  A subsidiary company,  the Livestock  Improvement  Corporation
139
(LIC)  is responsible  for on-farm  developments  such as dairy herd recording,  
breeding,  selection  and  progeny  testing  of bulls,  A.L, special  advisory  service  to 
farmers  via the Consulting  Officers,  processing  of farm  data  and providing  farm 
management  information.
Main  features  of dairy  farming  in New Zealand
There  are a number  of features  which  characterise  the type of dairy  farming  
and system  of milk production  which  has developed  in New Zealand.
(1) Low cost system  of milk  production
The milk  price  paid to farmers  is dependent  solely  on world  market  prices.  
There  are no subsidies  or price  supports  since  the mid-eighties.  Milk  prices  at 
farm level have fluctuated  from NZ$ 4-6/kg  milk fat (= 24-38  IRp/gallon)  in 
recent  years.  The cost of milk  production,  based  on a recent  survey of 200 dairy  
farms,  ranged  from  NZ$2.46  to 4.46/kg  milk  fat, equivalent  to 15-27  IRp/gallon  
from  the top 25% to the bottom  25% of the sample,  based  on profitability.  The 
net profit  margin  or economic  farm  surplus  ranged  from  NZ$  1.70-3.87/kg milk  
fat, equivalent  to 10-23  IR p/gallon  (Deane,  1993).
(2) Grass/clover  based  systems  of milk  production
Most  of the milk is produced  during  the active  grass-growing  season.  Cows  
start to calve 6-8 weeks  ahead  of the point where  grass growth  equals  feed 
demand.  Calving  starts in mid-late  July in the North  Island  and mid-August  in 
the South  Island.  These  cows  graze  on pasture  built  up in the previous  autumn/  
early winter.  Most cows will be calved  by the time grass growth  takes off 
Generally  no concentrates  are fed and conserved  hay, silage  or maize  is fed 
during  periods  of feed deficit,  e.g. during  a summer  drought,  early  winter  or in 
a late spring.  Nitrogen  is applied  (25-50  kg N/ha)  on most  dairy  farms  to boost  
grass  growth  in early spring  and in autumn.  White  clover  is relied  on to supply  
nitrogen  during  most  of the season  but fertiliser  nitrogen  is being  increasingly  
used on intensive  dairy farms  in recent  years.
(3) Large  herd  size - high output  per labour  unit
By Irish  standards  dairy  herds  are quite  large.  A typical  herd  contains  150-200 
cows,  managed  by one family  unit. Only 20% of herds  are less than 100 cows.  
Herd  sizes  are increasing  and a number  of very large  herds  (4(X)-800  cows)  exist.  
There  is a considerable  emphasis  on a high throughput  of cows through  the 
milking  parlour,  e.g. 150 cows  per labour  unit in 1.5 hours.
(4) Compact  calving
To maximise  milk  production  from  grass  considerable  emphasis  is placed  on 
compact  calving  so that the bulk of the herd have calved  down before  grass  
growth  takes  off in spring.  Tailpainting  before  and during  the breeding  season  
is widely  practised  to achieve  a high submission  rate (90%).  A.l. is widely  used 
during  the first 6 weeks  followed  by natural  service  for the next 6 weeks.  Over  
70% of cows  calve  in the first 4 weeks.  Late calving  cows  are induced  to calve  
prematurely  in many  herds to shorten  the calving  season.  These  cows  represent
140
0-20%  of cows  in a herd. Heifers,  late calvers  and cows  not detected  in heat are 
synchronised  to induce  oestrus  in many  herds.
(S ) High  genetic  merit  herds
A high  proportion  of cows  (66%)  are milk-recorded.  Dairy  herd  replacements  
are generally  bred from  the top 50% of cows  on a genetic  breeding  index  basis.  
High genetic  merit bulls are widely  used. These  are selected  from 150 bulls  
submitted  annually  for performance  and progeny  testing.  The top herds may 
breed  all cows  to dairy  bulls  to produce  surplus  heifcrs  for sale.  Herd  replacement  
rates are 20-25%,  resulting  in fairly  rapid  genetic  progress.
(6) Off-wintering  of  dry cows  on drystock  farms
Off-wintering  of dry cows  is practised  by many  intensive  dairy  farmers. This 
practice  permits  higher  stocking  rates  on the home  farm,  reduces  conserved  feed 
requirements,  allows  for a longer  lactation  and the whole  farm is rested  until 
calving.  Heifers  are also contract-reared  on outside  farms.
(7) Capital  investment  priorities
The main  capital  investment  in New Zealand  dairy  farms,  apart  from  cows,  
is in providing  a good milking  facility,  collection  yard, roads and fencing.  
Investment  in other  types  of housing  and machinery  is minimal.  Usually  a hay 
bam is used for storing  hay, rearing  calves,  storing  machinery,  etc. On some  
farms  there may be a feeding  pad for feeding  cows  off the pasture.  Machinery  
usually  consists  of a low HP tractor,  fertiliser  spreader,  silage  feeding  wagon,  
sprayer,  pick-up  truck  and motor  bike. The main emphasis  is to obtain  a good  
return  on investment  and to increase  the net worth  of the farm.
(8) Share  milking  system
A very successful  share  milking system  has operated  for many years  and has 
facilitated  the entry  of new  blood  from  many  sources  into dairy  farming.  Various  
schemes  exist,  e.g. 29-50%  arrangements,  whereby  the share  milker  owns  part 
or all of the herd, the land and facilities  are supplied  by the owner,  and the 
expenses  and profits  are divided  on an agreed  basis.  In due course  sharemilkers  
move  onto bigger  farms  and eventually  purchase  their  own farms.  This system  
builds  up a highly  skilled  and motivated  labour  force,  enables  older  established  
farmers  to phase  out of active  farming  and ensures  mobility  and expansion  in the 
industry.  However,  the high  cost  of land  is limiting  the opportunity  for  sharemilkers  
to purchase  their  own farms.
Year-round  grassland  management  on New Zealand  dairy  farms
Despite  the wide  variation  in soil type  and rainfall  in New  Zealand,  the system  
of grassland  management  on most dairy farms  follow  a general  pattern,  with 
some  local variations.  The main  objective  on all farms  is to convert  grazed  grass  
into milk with the minimum  of supplementary  feeding  and to winter  the cows  
during  the dry period  as cheaply  as possible.  During  the dry period  (May/July)  
on farms  where  cows  are wintered  on the home  farm,  cows  are grazed  restrictedly  
on winter pasture  and supplemented  with hay/silage  to maintain  them in 
moderate  condition  until  calving.  Pasture  cover  is built  up in the autumn  as cows  
are dried  off or culled  and restricted  grazing  begins, following  an application  of
141

142
nitrogen  (30-50  kg/ha)  to provide  an average  cover  of 2000  kg DM/ha  over  the 
whole  farm  at the start of calving  (Fig. 3). The cows  are strip grazed  using  back  
fences  in a long  rotation  over  the winter  (90-120  days).  Supplementary  feed,  e.g. 
hay/silage  or other  crops,  tend  to be fed in early winter  until the required  pasture  
cover is reached,  usually  on the grazed  area, but in some cases in specially  
constructed  feeding  areas. Wintering  pads  are provided  on some  farms  in wetter  
areas  or heavy  soils to which  cows  are moved  after grazing.  When  cows  calve  
down  in spring  (July/August  in North  Island)  the pasture  allocation  is increased  
to provide  16 kg DWcow/day  to the milking  cows  and the pasture  cover  on the 
farm  is gradually  reduced  to about  1500  kg DMlha  by September.  Hay or silage  
supplements  are fed during  this period  if grass  cover  is not adequate  to sustain  
milk  production.  Nitrogen  is applied  (25-50  kg N/ha)  to boost  grass  growth  in the 
grazed  area. From  mid-September  onwards  grass  growth  is usually  adequate  in 
the North  Island  to meet  the level of feed required  at peak lactation.  Cows  are 
rotationally  grazed  (16-24  day rotation)  during  October/November  to achieve  
maximum  milk production  from grass and to ensure  a high intake  during  the 
breeding  season.  Pasture  cover  gradually  increases  to 1800-20(X)  kg DM/ha.  
Surplus  grass (usually  10-30%  of the farm) is conserved  as hay or silage  but 
preference  is given  to the cows  and on some  farms  no grass is conserved.  Maize  
is grown  on some farms  as a green feed during  summer  drought.  In summer  
(December/February)  grass growth  is often poor (10-30  kg DM/ha)  due to a 
moisture  deficit  and supplementary  feeds,  e.g. hay,  silage  or green  maize  are fed 
to maintain  milk  production.  Deferred  pasture  accumulated  from spring  is strip 
grazed  in certain  areas,  e.g. Tarinaki.  Irrigation  is practised  in dry areas,  e.g. 
Canterbury.
In autumn  (March/April)  there is usually  a flush of growth  as the moisture  
deficit  is reduced.  However,  the emphasis  is switched  from maintaining  milk  
production  to building  up grass  reserves  for the winter,  even  at the expense  of the 
current  yield. Grazing  is restricted  to extend  the rotation  (30-50  days). Feed  
demand  is reduced  by selling  off cull cows,  drying  off low yielding  cows  and 
heifers  and grass growth  is boosted  by applying  nitrogen fertiliser  (25-50  kg N/ 
ha). Cow  body  condition  is improved  to achieve  a moderate  score  of 5 (= 2.5 Irish 
score). In early winter  (May)  the remaining  cows  are dried  off and the pasture  
is rationed  and grazed  tightly  down to less than  KXX)  kg DM/ha  over  the winter  
months  in a long rotation.  On many dairy farms  the cows are off-wintered  on 
other  farms,  e.g. sheep  farms  for all or part  of the winter.  Replacement  heifers  are 
usually  reared  off the dairy  farm,  i.e. contract  reared  by other  farmers  or on an 
out-farm,  or “run off ’ area and join the herd prior to calving.  Monitoring  of 
pasture  cover  going  into the winter  is an important  aspect  of feed  budgeting  since  
conserved  feed,  e.g. hay/silage  usually represents  only a small  part (30-50%)  of 
the total winter  feed requirements.  In a recent  survey  about  half of the dairy  
farmers  who responded  aimed  for a target  pasture  cover  at calving  either  by 
regular  assessment  or extended  rotation.  Assessment  was done mainly  by eye 
appraisal  (90%), while relatively  few used plate meters (9%), or pasture  
probes  (3%). Only 22% of farmers  formally  prepared  a feed budget  (Parker  
et al., 1993).
143
Dairy  farming  in the Southlands
The Southlands,  i.e. the southern  part of the South Island,  is climatically  
closest  to Ireland.  There,  the cows  calve  later,  e.g. August/September,  due to the 
longer  winter  and later growth  in spring  compared  with the North  Island.  The 
requirements  for winter  feed  are also  much  greater.  Dairy  herds  can be classified  
into two categories,  i.e. “self-contained ” or “milking  platforms ” (Ms. Gail 
Wylie,  LIC  Consulting  Officer,  personal  communication).  On the .self-contained 
farms  all winter  feed  is made  on the farm  and replacement  stock  are reared  on the 
farm. The stocking  rates are usually  1.6-2.4  cows/ha  producing  270-440  kg 
milkfat/ha.  Winter  feed requirements  are 9-10 kg DM/cow,  since cows are 
generally  larger  (mainly  Friesian)  and weather  is colder  than in the North  Island.  
Conserved  feed requirements  are in the region  of 1000-1100 kg DM/cow.  This 
includes  an average  of 600 kg DM/cow  as hay or silage  and 200 kg DM/cow  as 
crops,  e.g. kale or swedes  for feeding  during  the winter. About  250 kg DM/cow  
of hay or silage  is fed to milking  cows  in autumn  and spring.  About  10-20%  of 
winter  feed  requirements  is obtained  from  grazed  pasture  when  soil conditions  
allow. Thus total conserved  feed requirements  for self-contained  herds in 
Southland  are equivalent  to 5-6 tonnes  silage  (20% DM), fairly similar  to the 
requirements  in the South  of Ireland.  About  half  of the dairy  farms  in Southland  
are described  as milking  platforms,  i.e. milking  cows  only  are carried  on the farm  
during  the grazing  season.  Replacement  stock  are reared  off the farm  until prior  
to calving.  Cows  are off-wintered  either  on another  farm,  e.g. a sheep  farm  or 
on a “run off ’ area which  is separate  from  the dairy  farm where  they are fed hay/ 
silage  plus brassica  crops  or they are wintered  on a stand-off  feed pad and fed 
mainly  on purchased  hay or silage.
On these farms the stocking  rates are higher,  e.g. 2.4-3.5  cows/ha  and 
consequently  milk production  is higher  (400-700  kg milkfat/ha)  and they are 
generally  more  profitable.  Conserved  feed  made  on the dairy farm  is of the order  
of200-300  kg DM/cow  to supplement  pasture  in autumn  and to provide  for a wet 
spring.  The pasture  on these  farms  is rested  over  the winter  and is grazed  only  by 
in-calf  heifers  which  are brought  home  for a month  before  calving  starts.
Limitations  and weaknesses  in New  Zealand  dairying
New Zealand  dairy farming  is often held up as a m^el  which  Irish dairy  
farmers  should  follow.  The system  of dairy  farming  in New  Zealand  has evolved  
over the years  to suit the climate,  pattern  of grass  growth,  scale of farming  and 
distance  from its main  market  outlets.  While  there  are some  similarities  there  are 
also differences  between  the two countries  which  must be taken into account.  
There  are many  progressive  and highly  motivated  dairy  farmers  in New  Zealand.  
However,  the dairy  industry there  has its own limitations  and weaknesses  which  
must  be recognised.
(/) Under-feeding  of  dairy  cows  and heifers
By Irish or European  standards.  New Zealand  dairy  cows  are quite  light and 
generally  are in poorer  condition.  Jersey  cows average  about 350 kg while  
Friesians  average  about  450 kg, except  in Southland  (500  kg). Cows  are calved  
down  in moderate  condition  (BCS  = 2.5) and are stocked  heavily  on intensive
144
dairy farms  with little supplementation.  Cows  with a high breeding  index  are 
seldom  given  an opportunity  to realise  their  potential.  Heifers  are generally  light  
at mating  (280 kg) and calve  down  at light weights  (380-400  kg). They  have  to 
compete  with the other  cows on intensively  stocked  farms  and consequently  
about  25% of heifers  are culled  annually.  There  is a growing  awareness  of the 
need to feed cows  better.
(2) Extremely  seasonal  pattern  of milk  production
The concentrated  pattern  of calving  and limited  supplementary  feeding  
during  early  or late lactation  results  in a very  high  seasonal  milk  production  peak  
in Oct./Nov.  This results  in a high investment  in processing  capacity  which  is 
severely  stretched  during  the peak period  and is poorly  utilized  during  the 
remainder  of the season. The current  expansion  in milk  production  will  put even  
more pressure  on the existing  processing  capacity.  The short lactation  length  
(220-230  days)  of most  dairy  herds  contributes  to this problem.  Better  feeding,  
particularly  in mid/late  lactation  would  help to round  out the seasonal  pattern  of 
milk  production.  Winter  milk  production  is never  likely  to be economical  in New  
2^aland  apart  from  domestic  liquid  milk requirements.
(3) Variation  in pasture  production  and quality
Apart  from seasonal  and regional  variation  in grass growth,  many of the 
swards  are very open,  presumably  due to repeated  hard grazing  in winter  and 
during  summer  drought.  Ingress  of weeds  are a problem,  i.e. dandelion,  docks  
and  ragworth  in the South  Island.  In dry areas  perennial  ryegrass  performs  poorly  
and other  more  drought-resistant  species  are being  introduced,  e.g. tall fescue,  
cocksfoot,  paspalum.  The white  clover  content  of many  swards  is often  less than 
expected  (0-20%)  and in many  cases  makes  only a small  contribution  to sward  
fertility  and productivity.  Many  dairy farmers  are increasingly  using fertiliser  
nitrogen  throughout  the season  to overcome  their  dependence  on clover.  The use 
of nitrogen  fertilizers  has increased  four-fold  in recent  years.
(4) Pasture  pests  and animal  diseases
The roots  of grass  and clover  are susceptible  to attack  from  “grass  grub ” in the 
North  Island,  resulting  in reduced  productivity.  The base of grass plants are 
subject  to attack  by Argentinian  stem  weevil. This  problem  can be overcome  by 
sowing  ryegrass  varieties  containing  an endophyte  (a fungus)  which  makes  the 
plant  resistant  to attack  from stem weevil.  However  the endophyte  contains  a 
toxin which  gives  rise to a neuromuscular  disorder  in cattle  and sheep  known  as 
grass  staggers.  Cows  are also susceptible  to other  disorders,  e.g. grass  tetany  in 
spring,  bloat  on high clover  swards  and facial  eczema.  Preventative  measures  
usually  involve  continuous  drenching  in the milking  parlour  during  the periods  
of susceptibility.
(5) A conservative  approach  to dairying
Most  dairy  farmers  have  become  accustomed  to the “all grass ” system  of milk 
production  which  has evolved  over  the years  with its emphasis  on low cost milk  
production.  They are reluctant  to make changes  in that system  and there is a 
strong  resistance  to feeding  supplements  especially  concentrates,  which  might  
increase  feed costs.  However,  this attitude  is beginning  to change  and given  a
145
period  of stable  or rising  world  market  prices  for dairy  products,  better  feeding  
regimes,  including  more  supplementation,  are likely  to be adopted.
(6) High  priced  land
In the intensive  dairying  regions  of the North  Island  farmland  suitable  for 
dairying  is becoming  very  expensive.  Existing  dairy  farms  are sold on the basis  
of current  levels  of production,  i.e. NZ$30-40/kg  milkfat  which  is equivalent  to 
IR£ 1,500-2,000/acre,  due to competition  between  dairy farmers,  other land 
users, e.g. stud farmers,  horticulturists  and “hobby  farmers ” near towns and 
cities.  This  results  in a high  level  of  borrowings  for new  entrants,  e.g. sharemilkers  
and is beginning  to limit  their  numbers. As a result  there  is a movement  by such 
people  to the South  Island  and other  less traditional  areas  to start up dairying  in 
areas  where  land is cheaper  and larger  farms  can be established.
Milk  production  on New  Zealand  dairy  farms
Recent  trials  carried  out at one of the Dairy  Research  Corporation  farms  at 
Ruakura  have  shown  that high levels  of milk  production,  e.g. 700 kg milkfat/ha  
and 500 kg milk  protein/ha  can be achieved  when  cows  are intensively  stocked  
at levels  where  milk  production  per  cow  was reduced  when  no supplements  were  
fed during  lactation.  The  maximum  production  of milk  solids  and income/ha  was 
achieved  at stocking  rates of 3.0 Friesian  cows/ha  and 3.8-4.0  Jersey  cows/ha.  
Higher  levels  of milkfat  production/ha  were  achieved  with  Jersey  cows  than  with 
Friesian  cows as milk  production/cow  was depressed  to a lesser  extent  at high 
stocking  rates with Jersey  cows  compared  with Friesians.
A recent  survey  of milk  production  costs  and profitability  from  a representa ­
tive sample  of 198 dairy  farmers  throughout  New Zealand  has been carried  out 
in the 1991/92  season  by the Livestock  Improvement  Corporation  (Deane,  
1993).  The  farms  involved  represented  a wide  range  in farming  conditions,  levels  
of  production  and farming  ability.  There  was a strong  linear  relationship  between  
stocking  rate and milk  fat production/ha  (Fig.  4). The stocking  rate ranged  from  
1-4 cows/ha  (2.5-0.6  acs/cow)  and milk  fat production  ranged  from  <100  to 750

kg milkfat/ha  equivalent  to a range  of <240  to 1,800  gallons  of milk/acre  at 3.6%  
butterfat.  There  was no indication,  over the wide range  of farming  conditions,  
cow potential  and managerial  ability  involved,  that milk yield per cow was 
depressed  as stocking  rate was reduced  (Fig.  5). It may  be surprising  to many  that 
such a wide range in stocking  rate and production  exists in New Zealand  
dairying.  Farm receipts  (income)  per hectare  were highly  related  to milk fat 
production/ha  but farm  expenses  and overhead  costs  also increased  (Fig.  6). The 
economic  farm surplus  or net profit  margin/ha  (i.e. money  available  to service  
debt, personal  drawings,  tax and reinvestment)  also increased  with increased  
milkfat  production/ha  but the relationship  was weak,  indicating  that the same  
level of income  was achieved  at vastly  different  levels  of production  (Fig. 7).

production  and profitability  which  exist among  New  Zealand  dairy fanners.

potential  in terms  of milk  production  the top 10% of milk  producers  produce  25- 
35% more  milkfat  + protein/ha  than the district  average  while  they produce  61- 
86% more  than  the bottom  25% (Table  7). These  differences  are likely to be due 
to a number  of factors,  e.g. higher  stocking  rates,  differences  in breed  type or 
genetic  potential  of the cows,  whether  replacements  are reared  on or off  the farm,  
off-wintering  of dry cows,  and differences  in managerial  ability,  stockmanship  
and ambitions  of the individual  farmers.
The main factors  determining  a high output  of milk solids/ha  have been  
established  from  research  at Ruakura  and other  centres.  These  are (1) stocking  
rate, (2) calving  date and spread,  (3) cow quality  and (4) drying-off  decisions  in 
relation  to feed supply.  Other  factors,  including  the management  of feed supply  
are of minor  importance  compared  with those  listed  above  (Bryant,  1993).
Agricultural  research  in New  Zealand
Government  funding  for “public  good ” research  is channelled  through  an 
agency  called  the Foundation  for Research,  Science  and Technology  (FRST).  
The funds are administered  through  ten Crown  Research  Institutes  which  are 
responsible  for the various  research  organisations  involved  in agriculture,  
industry,  environment,  etc. The research  organisations  most relevant  to grass ­
land, animal  production  and dairying  are as follows:
Ag Research  - NZ Pastoral  Agricultural  Research  Institute.
It is responsible  for all aspects  of grassland  and animal  production  research,  
other  than dairying.  It is divided  into five main divisions  located  at different  
centres  in New Zealand.

research  stations  attached  to these  centres,  located  in strategic  soil type/climatic  
areas  with  a team  of research  and technical  staff  at each  station  to develop  animal  
production  systems  suited  to those  areas.
Dairy  Research  Corporation  (DRC)
This  organisation  is a joint  venture  between  the New  Zealand  Dairy  Board  and 
the Ministry  of Agriculture.  It is responsible  for all dairy farm production  
research.  The staff and facilities  include  those formerly  involved  in dairv  
production  research  at the Ruakura  Research  Centre,  Tarinaki  Agricultural  
Research  Station  and the Lactation  Physiology  Dept, based  at Ruakura  Research  
Centre.  Its mam goal is to promote  innovation  in New Zealand  dairy farm 
production  and to enhance  its competitiveness  by increased  production  from 
existing  systems  (1750  kg milk  solids/ha)  through  improved  pasture  production

Advisory  Service
The  M  AF advisory  service,  which  was formerly  available  free  to farmers,  has 
been considerably  reduced  from  320 to 125 staff  currently  and is now available  
on a fee paying  basis  only.  Management  and financial  advice  is also provided  by 
commercial  consultants  (90),  company  advisers  and the Consulting  Officers  (33) 
of the Livestock  Improvement  Corporation.  These  have  to provide  a service  to 
56,000  livestock  and crop farmers  and 9,000  horticulturists.
Dairy  Research  and Development  Funding
Funding  for dairy production  and processing  research  and development  in 
New Zealand  is largely  paid for by the dairy industry  and amounts  to NZ$40  
million,  equivalent  to 1^14  million  per annum.  This represents  an average  
contribution  of £1,000  per farmer  or £6 per cow, or 0.8p per gallon  of milk  
compared  with  the Dairy  Research  Levy  in Ireland  of O.lp per gallon.  The total 
investment  in agricultural  research  in New Zealand,  despite  recent  cutbacks,  
would  be at least 3-4 times  greater  than in Ireland.  This gives  New Zealand  a 
considerable  advantage  to expand  their  production,  develop  new products  and 
gain access  to world  markets  at the expense  of Irish and other  producers.
Conclusions
There are some similarities  between  the Irish and New Zealand  dairy  
industries  in that both  are largely  based  on grassland,  are seasonal  producers  and 
are largely  export  oriented.  However,  the North  Island  of New Zealand,  where  
most of the dairy farming  occurs,  does have a climatic  advantage  in terms  of 
temperature  and sunshine.  Grass  production  is more  evenly  distributed  (except  
in mid-summer)  and grass  growth  in winter  is far higher  in New  Zealand,  thereby  
considerably  reducing  the need for expensive  winter  feed. The ability  to out- 
winter  cows  results  in a considerable  saving  in terms  of housing,  slurry  storage  
and disposal.  This  saving  in winter  feed and housing  coupled  with  a much larger  
herd  size  enables  New  Zealand  dairy  farmers  to produce  milk  at an extremely  low 
price  and survive  at low world  market  prices.  In the Southlands,  the climate  is 
more  similar  to that along  the south  coast  of Ireland,  but temperatures  in early  
spring  are higher  in Southland,  resulting  in earlier  grass  growth.  The amount  of 
sunshine  is also higher  in Southland  throughout  the winter  and this helps  to dry 
out the soil as well as favouring  grass growth.  Self-contained  dairy farms in 
Southland  produce  a lot of winter  feed, approximately  similar  to dairy  farms  in 
the South  of Ireland.
While  there  are these  differences  in climate,  pattern  of grass  growth  and the 
scale of operation  between  Irish and New Zealand  dairy farming,  there are, 
nevertheless,  certain  aspects  of New Zealand  dairy farming  which  are quite  
relevant  to Irish dairy farmers.  These  are (1) the ability  to match  the overall  
stocking  rate to the grass production  potential  of the farm so as to maximise  
production  per hectare,  where  quota  constraints  do not operate,  (2) calving  the 
cows  in a compact  manner  about  a month  ahead  of the point  where grass growth  
is expected  to take off (i.e. February/March),  (3) manage  the pasture  so as to 
maximise  milk production  through  the main growing  season,  (4) extend  the
151
grazing  season,  where  the stocking  rate and soil type  allows,  by building  up grass  
cover  in autumn  for grazing  in early winter  (November/December)  and early  
spring  (February/March),  (5) milk  recording  of more  herds,  to identify  the better  
cows  for breeding  and use of high  RBI  bulls  to improve  the genetic  quality  of the 
herd,  (6) manage  the farming  operation  as a business  so as to maximise  the farm 
net income  and increase  the net worth  of the farm,  (7) greater  mobility  into and 
out of dairy  farming,  which  is a regular  feature  of New  Zealand  dairying,  and the 
inflow  of young  blood  via farm apprenticeship  or sharemilking  arrangements.  
The right  to build  up entitlement  to a reasonable  sized quota  and transfer  it onto 
their own farm ultimately  would  be essential  if such a system  is to operate  
successfully.
