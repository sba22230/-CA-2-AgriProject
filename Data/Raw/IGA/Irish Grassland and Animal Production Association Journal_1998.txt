The Effect  of Genotype  and Feeding  
System  on the Performance  of Holstein  
Friesian  Cows at Pasture
F. BUCKLEY  and P. DILLON

The rate of genetic  improvement  in Ireland  up until the mid-80 ’s was low 
(approx.  0.5% per year) compared  to North  America  where  genetic  merit  for 
milk production  was increasing  by 1.5%  per year (Funk,  1993).  Since 1985 the 
rate of genetic  improvement  increased  markedly  to about  1.5%  per year  in 1992  
(Coffey,  1992).  This high rate of genetic  progress  has mostly  been achieved  
through  the importation  of North  American  and European  genetics.  The relative  
merit  of these sires has been obtained  from the performance  of their progeny  
in systems of milk  production  which  differ  greatly  from  those  operated  in Ireland.
The term “high  genetic  index ” (HGI)  in this paper  is used to describe  a cow,  
which  as a result  of selection,  is generally  predisposed  to produce  significantly  
more milk than a cow of lower  merit  status.  Studies  from New Zealand  have  
shown  that cows of high ‘genetic  index ’ at pasture,  produce  more  milk (20 to 
40%),  consume  more herbage  (5 to 20%),  were more efficient  convertors  of 
food into milk (10 to 15%) than lower  merit  cows (Holmes,  1988).  However,  
these ‘high ’ genetic  index  cows  would  be considered  ‘low ’ when  compared  to 
present-day  genetics.  Recent  results  from  Langhill  (Veerkamp  etal, 1994)  have  
shown  that increasing  genetic  index  results  in major  increases  in feed  efficiency,  
reflecting  increases  in milk yield with cows fed indoors  on silage/concentrate  
diets. There  is little information  available  on the performance  of present-day  
HGI dairy cows on seasonal  calving,  grass-based  systems  of milk production.
Implication  of increased  cow genetic  merit  (CGI)

Figure  1. Effect  of increased  milk production  on feed efficiency  
(Relative  ME requirement  in Mj for Maintenance  and Production)
increased  output  per cow and per hectare  since 1983 in controlled  full lactation  
experiments  at Moorepark.  ‘Moorepark  1983 ’ refers  to the performance  being  
achieved  at the introduction  of EU milk  quotas  in 1983.  ‘Moorepark  1996  MGF  
and ‘Moorepark  1996 HGF refer  to the performances  being  achieved  over  the 
last two years with cows with present-day  medium  genetic  index  (MGI)  and 
very high genetic  index  (HGI)  in similar  feeding  systems.  This has led to an 
increase  of 50% and 28% in milk yield per cow and per hectare,  respectively.  
It is not possible  to differentiate  precisely  how  much  of this increase  came  from  
genetic  improvement  and how much came from management  plus feeding.  
Figure  1 shows  the effect  of this increased  performance  on overall feed  efficiency.  
With  the Moorepark  cow of 1983,44%  of its total feed  requirement  was required  
for maintenance,  while with the HGI cows of 1996, only 36% of its feed 
requirement  was required  for maintenance.  This has resulted  in an increase  in 
feed efficiency  of 16%. There  is no evidence  that CGI has any influence  on 
partial  efficiency  of ME use for milk production  (Grainger  et ai, 1985).  
Therefore,  the extra  energy  requirement  for milk  yield  must  come  from  increased  
intake  and/or  greater  mobilisation  of body  reserves,  especially  in early  lactation.  
Recent  studies  have shown  (Veerkamp  et al., 1994)  that cows  of HGI produce  
significantly  higher  milk yield than cows of lower  genetic  index (LGI)  with 
only small  differences  in intake  of energy. A breeding  programme  based  solely  
on increased  milk yield and angularity  (or dairyness)  without  consideration  of 
feed intake  may result  in an animal  which  depends  on large mobilisation  of 
body tissue  in early lactation  (negative  energy  balance)  to support  high milk  
yields.  Such a breeding  programme  may not be suitable  in seasonal  spring ­
calving  systems  which  depend  to a large  extent  on grazed  grass  as a feed,  due 
to the possibility  of increases  in metabolic  disorders  and reduced  fertility  
performance.
Moorepark  comparison
In the autumn  of 1994,  two contrasting  genetic  groups  of in-calf  heifers  were  
assembled  at Moorepark.  The pedigree  index of the two groups  is shown  in 
Table  2. The pedigree  indices  of the HGI group  were 13 kg of fat and 14 kg 
of protein  higher  than the MGI  group.  It should  be noted  that average  RBI (95) 
for first lactation  animals  in 1995 nationally  was 104 (IDRC).

Three  different  feeding  systems  were compared  with each genotype.  The 
Moorepark  feeding  system  (System  A) incorporates  high stocking  rate (2.54  
cows/ha),  high nitrogen  input  (400 kg N/ha)  and a planned  concentrate  input  
of 500 kg/cow  (Dillon  et ai, 1995).  System  B had a similar  stocking  rate and 
nitrogen  input  to System  A, but twice  the level of concentrate.  System  C had 
a similar  level of concentrate  and nitrogen  to System  A but with unrestricted  
levels of high  quality  grass throughout  the year.  To maintain  system  C, achieving  
second-cut  silage  was not a priority.  The feeding  systems  were applied  from  
mid-April  to end of November.  A total of 48 HGI and 48 MGI animals  were  
used. Excess  grass was harvested  as wrapped  baled silage  to maintain  grass  
quality.  Grass was considered  to be in excess  when pre-grazing  yields  were  
>2000  kg DM/ha.  In 1996, a total of 3.2 ha in system  A, 3.8 ha in system  B, 
and 4.8 ha in system  C were harvested  in this manner.
Performance  in 1995
Tables  3 and 4 show  the average  performance  of the two genotypes  across  
the three  feeding  systems  (adjusted  for calving  date)  in 1995  and 1996.  In 1995,  
when all animals  were in their 1st lactation,  the HGI heifers  produced

significantly  more  milk  per cow (+945  kg) of a lower  fat content  (-0.31%)  and 
slightly  lower  protein  content  (-0.09%).  The yield of fat and protein  was 
significantly  higher  for the HGI  heifers.  The grass-growing  season  of 1995  was 
very erratic  with very poor growth  rates in the August/September  period  due 
to the large  moisture  deficit.  Concentrate  supplementation  therefore  was much  
higher  than planned.  The actual  concentrate  feeding  levels  were 863, 1449 and 
859 kg concentrates/cow  for the feeding  systems  A, B, and C, respectively.  
There  was no interaction  between  feeding  system  and CGI, i.e. both groups  
of heifers  responded  similarly  to each feeding  system.  The average  response  
to concentrate  feeding  was 0.80 kg milk/kg  of extra  concentrate  fed in feeding  
system  B.
Performance  in 1996
Table  4 shows  the milk production  for both genotypes  (averaged  across  the 
three feeding  systems).  In Figure  2, the milk production  profile  for both  
genotypes  is shown.

Week of Lactation
Figure  2. Effect  of cow genetic  index  on mean milk yield by week  of
lactation  (1996).
The HGI cows  produced  significantly  higher  yields  of milk (+904  kg), fat 
(28 kg) and  protein  (29 kg) of slightly  lower  fat content  (-0,13)  and with  similar  
protein  content.  The average  daily  milk production  for the MGI  and HGI cows  
was 22.5 kg (4.8 gals) and 25.6 kg (5.5 gals) per cow over the lactation.  Peak  
milk production  was obtained  in early May at 35 kg/cow/day  (7.5 gals) and 
31 kg/cow/day  (6.6 gals) for the HGI and MGI cows,  respectively.  Lactation  
lengths  were similar  for both genotypes.
Tables  5, 6 and 7 show  the milk production  (adjusted  for calving  date) for 
both genotypes  on each feeding  system.  The concentrate  feeding  levels  were  
695, 1340 and 695 kg concentrate/cow  for feeding  systems  A, B and C, 
respectively,  over the entire lactation  in 1996. Concentrate  supplementation  
exceeded  the target  level in 1996 due to delayed  turnout  resulting  from poor  
grass  growth  rates.  Cows  were turned  out to pasture  by day on April 1 and by 
day and night  on April 10. There  was no interaction  between  CGI and feeding  
system,  although  the difference  in fat and protein  yield  between  genotype  was 
greatest  in feeding  system  B (+64 kg). The average  response  was 1.12 and 0.92  
kg milk/kg  extra  concentrate  fed for the HGI and MGI cows,  respectively,  of 
solids-corrected  milk.  The best responses  were obtained  in the autumn  period  
and the lowest  responses  were  recorded  in early  spring.  The milk  yield  response  
to feeding  system  C was 190 kg (41 gals)  of solids-corrected  milk  over  the total 
lactation.  The largest  responses  were again obtained  in the autumn  when  
supplemented  with  high  quality  grass  silage  while  the Moorepark  feeding  system  
were on grass-only.

Grazing  management  and intake
Table  8 shows  the intake  estimates  taken  in both 1995 and 1996.  Individual  
animal  intake  was measured  on 4 occasions  during  lactation  in 1995 (May  to 
November)  using  the n-alkane  technique  of Mayes  et al. (1986),  as modified  
by Dillon  and Stakelum  (1989).  Over the four intake  measurement  periods,  
concentrate  supplementation  levels  of feeding  systems  A, B and C averaged  
1.0, 3.5 and 1.0 kg/day,  respectively.  During  the 3 measurement  periods  in 1996  
(June  to September),  feeding  systems  A and C were  on grass  only while  feeding  
system  B was supplemented  with 3.0 kg of concentrates  daily.  For both years,  
the HGI group  had higher  intakes  (5% in 1995 and 8% in 1996).  In 1996,  the 
daily allowance  of herbage  (>4 cm) to achieve  these intakes  were 24, 21 and 
27 for feeding  systems  A, B, and C, respectively.  Supplementation  with  
concentrates  at pasture  significantly  increased  total dry matter  intake  (TDMI)  
in both  years  with small  reductions  in grass  dry matter  intakes  (GDMI). Previous  
studies  (with lower  milk producing  cows)  have shown  that when cows are 
supplemented  with concentrates  at pasture,  large substitution  rates can occur.
Previous  results  from  Moorepark  (Stakelum  et al., 1988)  suggest  that at daily  
intakes  of 10, 12, 14, 16 and 17 kg of grass  dry matter/cow,  substitution  rates

of 0.20,0.32,0.44,0.55  and 0.62 kg/kg  of concentrate,  respectively,  will result.  
The reduction  in grass intake  per kg of concentrate  offered  in study in 1996  
was 0.2. The consequence  of this is the very good milk yield response  to the 
concentrate  which  was achieved.  The increase  in intake  with feeding  system  
C averaged  0.5 kg/day  when compared  to feeding  system  A.
During  the dry period  of 1996,  individual  intakes  were  measured  on 20 HGI  
and 20 MGI  cows.  The genotypes  were  balanced  on expected  calving  date and 
received  high quality  silage  (75 DMD)  ad-lib.  The HGI cows  had significantly  
(P<0.01 ) higher  DM intakes  at 13/2 and 12.1 kg/cow/day  for the HGI  and MGI  
cows, respectively.
Liveweight  and condition  score
Table  9 shows  the liveweight  at critical  stages  of lactation  for both genotypes,  
while  Figure  3 shows  the effect  of genotypes  by week  of lactation.  Over  the 
total lactation,  the HGI cows gained  less liveweight  during  the lactation  (27 
kg in 1995;  59 kg in 1996)  compared  to the MGI  (42 kg in 1995;  86 kg in 1996).  
This was as a result  of either  losing  more liveweight  in early lactation  and/or
Week of Lactation

gaining  lower  liveweight  in the second  half of lactation.  The opposite  was the 
situation  during  the dry period  when  the average  liveweight  gain was 1.20 and 
0.90 for the HGI and MGI cows,  respectively.  This high level of liveweight  
gain during  the dry period  was achieved  on ad-libitum  high quahty  silage  (75 
DMD).  Feeding  system  had no effect  on liveweight  at any stage of lactation.
Table 10 shows  the condition  score  at similar  stages  of lactation  to that of 
liveweight  in Table  9. Condition  score  changes  follow  liveweight  changes  during  
lactation.  The condihon  score  of the HGI  cows  was lower  at all stages of lactation  
when compared  to the MGI cows,  while  again feeding  system  had no effect.

1996  and 1997.  The breeding  seasons  were  confined  to 13 weeks  in both years.  
There  was no effect  of cow genetic  index  on submission  rate,  calving-to-service-  
interval,  or calving-to-conception-interval.  However, the  HGI  cows  had a greater  
number  of services  per conception,  lower  pregnancy  rates  to 1 st and 2nd service  
with subsequently  higher  infertile  rates. There  was no indication  that feeding  
system  had any effect  on any of the fertility  parameters  measured.

Discussion
(1) There  was no indication  of an interaction  between  CGI and the feeding  
system  evaluated  in this study.  However,  there was an indication  that the
10
response  to concentrates  was higher  with the HGI cows  in 1996 (1.12  and 
0.9 kg milk/kg  of extra concentrate  fed with the HGI and MGI cows,  
respectively).  It is also important  to emphasize  the narrow  range of the 
genotypes  used in this study.  The two years results  also indicate  that the 
difference  in milk production  between  the two genotypes  is very similar  
to that which  can be predicted  from the pedigree  index.
(2) There  is a clear  indication  in this study that selection  of cows for higher  
milk  production  leads  to higher  feed intake  as a consequence  of the genetic  
correlation  between  these  traits.  To accommodate  a cow with an RBI (95) 
of 135, as compared  to that of 100, it is estimated  that stocking  rate would  
have to be reduced  by between  15 and 20%, if most of the extra milk  
production  is to be obtained  from grazed  grass and silage.  With reduced  
stocking  rate in place then, it will depend  on grazing  management  skills  
of the farmers  to be able to consistently  maintain  a sward  of high quality.  
Cows,  regardless  of their  genetic  merit,  require  good  management  practices  
to be adhered  to if they are to perform  to their  potential.  This is especially  
so as the herd ’s CGI increases.
(3) The milk  yield  response  to feeding  extra  concentrates  at pasture  was much  
higher  than that  reported  previously with  lower  milk-producing  cows. Hoden  
et al. (1991)  reported  higher  milk yield  responses  from higher-producing  
cows. The higher  milk yield responses  are supported  with the lower  
substitution  rates  of concentrates  for grass  and no effect  of feeding  system  
on liveweight  change.  The milk  yield  response  to allocation  of extra  grass  
(system  C) was small  (190 kg). These  results  are supported  with the small  
increase  in GDMI  achieved.  However,  feeding  system  A (which  is the 
Control)  was managed  on a daily basis to provide  sufficient  high quality  
grass with a post-grazing  height  of 5 to 6 cm.
(4) The reduced  fertility  performance  of the HGI cows  is of concern  and will 
require  further  investigation.  However, evidence  is accumulating  to suggest  
that milk production  will mainly  reduce  reproductive  performance  when  
the intake  of energy  is insufficient  to meet current  milk output  and this 
results  in prolonged  negative  energy  balance  (NEB)  in early  lactation.  The 
severity  and duration  of NEB  may vary,  depending  on body condition  score  
at calving,  production  level,  ration  formulation  and environmental  factors.  
Studies  to define  more  precisely  the effect  of increasing  milk  yield  in early  
lactation on reproductive  performance,  especially  in Holsteins,  are required.  
Oestrus  detection  rates  and pregnancy  rates  for American  Holsteins  of less 
than 50% are accepted  widely  in the USA (Macmillan  et al., 1996).
Conclusions
The objective  of this study was to evaluate  the performance  of HGI and 
MGI  cows  on three  grassland  based  feeding  systems.  The results  clearly  show  
that cows of HGI produce  higher  yields  of milk and milk constituents.  There  
was no significant  CGI x feeding  system  interaction  observed  for any of the 
measurements  taken,  indicating  that HGI dairy  cows  do not respond  differently  
to feeding  system  when compared  to MGI cows (across  the range of diets
11
examined).  It is also evident  that HGI cows have higher  grass DM intake  and 
total DM intake.  The study also indicates  that HGI cows have a higher  rate 
of liveweight  loss in the post-calving  period,  and that HGI cows  have a lower  
live-weight  gain during  lactation,  suggesting  greater  body tissue  mobilisation.  
They also exhibit  higher  rates of gain during  the dry period.  The HGI cows  
clearly  maintain  a lower  condition  score at all stages  of lactation  suggesting  
a high  correlation  between  selection  for CGI and this trait. Feeding  system  had 
a significant  effect  on yield  of milk and milk  constituents,  DM intake,  and had 
no effect  on milk composition.  Feeding  system  had no effect  on live-weight,  
condition  score,  live-weight  change,  and condition  score  change.  In the present  
study,  milk yield  response  to additional  concentrate  fed was much  larger  than 
that reported  previously. Both  genotypes in the present  study are  of higher  genetic  
index than those in previous  studies.  The present  study may suggest  that 
increasing  CGI  has a detrimental  effect  on fertility  performance,  although  further  
research  is required  in this area.

Introduction
Competitive  agriculture  depends  on the efficient  production  of high quality  
food  in a clean  and healthy  environment.  Nutrient  inputs,  including  phosphorus  
(P) are essential  to optimise  production.  Irish farmers  are currently  spending  
over  £300  million  annually  on inorganic  fertiliser  of which  approximately  20%  
is spent  on P. Recent  research  suggests  that P inputs  into agriculture  have been  
too high in recent  years  in some  situations  (Tunney,  1990).  International  reports  
suggest  that there is considerable  potential  for P losses  from agriculture  into 
water  bodies  (Sharpley  and Rekolainen  (1997),  Lennox,  Foy, Smith  and Jordan  
(1997),  Sibbesen  & Sharpley  (1997).  In 1996, the P recommendations  for 
grassland  were reviewed  and revised.
Phosphorus  is an essential  element  for plant  and animal  life. In agricultural  
systems  P is needed  for seed and root formation,  and the accumulation  and 
release  of energy  during  cellular  metabolism  (Finkl  and Simonson,  1979).  In 
animals,  P is required  for bone formation  and a deficiency  can cause  
osteomalacea.  ‘Pica ’ or depraved  appetite  has been noted  in cattle  when  there  
is a deficiency  of P in the diet.  Low dietary  P may also be associated  with poor  
fertility  and apparent  dysfunction  of the ovaries  causing  inhibition,  depression  
or irregularity  of oestrus.
In the 1950s  soils were generally  extremely  deficient  in P, resulting  in low 
yields  of grass  and crops  and in some  areas  aphosphorosis  in livestock.  Farmers  
have,  over  the past three  to four decades,  rectified  this situation  by the constant  
application  of phosphatic  fertilisers.  Now  as we approach  the end of the 1990s,  
there appears  to be excessive  P being used in some parts of the agricultural  
production  system  and this is contributing  to eutrophication  of rivers  and lakes.
The sources  of P loss and the pathways  of P loss are the subject  of considerable  
controversy.  There  are three main sources  of P losses;-
1) Seepage  of soiled  water  from farmyards  appears  to be the main culprit  and 
there  is little  doubt  that if farmyard  design  and maintenance  were  improved,  
there  would  be less P pollution  of our waterways.  The EPA  have  suggested  
that up to 50% of agricultural  pollution  is due to seepage  from farmyards.
2) Slurry  spreading  in itself  will not lead to run-off  of P. It is spreading  slurry  
at the wrong  rates, or in the wrong  place,  or at the wrong  times that lead 
to slurry  finding  its way into drains,  rivers  and streams.  Spreading  slurry  
at reasonable  rates during  the grass growing  season  in places  where  there  
is no risk of runoff  into rivers/lakes  will ensure  no loss of P.
3) Elevated  soil P levels.  There  is evidence  that increasing  soil P levels  can 
lead to increased  P runoff  in areas  where  run-off  to water-bodies  is possible  
(Kurtz  et al., 1998).

This paper deals with agronomic  rather  than environmental  issues.  The 
objective  is to present  the background  and justification.
Soil testing
There  are many  soil testing  methods  used internationally  across  Europe  to 
measure  available  soil P. The method  used at Johnstown  Castle  is the Morgan ’s 
test. One study  of various  soil tests showed  that Morgan ’s extractant  compared  
favourably  with  the limited  range  of others studied  and was superior  to a modified  
Olsen  Extractant  (Brereton,  1970).  The for the Morgans  extractant  for a 
select  group  of sites that contained  Lolium  perenne  and other  sown  species  was 
43.5%.  It was 17% over a wider  range  of sites. The results  from the study  did 
not provide  the basis  for replacing  Morgan  extractant  with any of the alternative  
methods  tested.  Data from a plot experiment  on ryegrass  (Humphreys,  1996) 
and from  field  experiments  on 77 sugar  beet  soils  (Herlihy,  1986)  also indicated  
the superiority  of the Morgans  extractant  vis a vis other test methods  like 
conventional  Olsen  extractant.  For sugar  beet, Morgan  P accounted  for 34% 
of the variation  in fertiliser  P requirement,  Mehlich-2  for 35%,  Olsen  for 26%  
and 0.01 m CaCl^  for 16%.
There  is no doubt  that the Morgan  P test has limitations.  Furthermore,  in 
interpreting  the results  of the tests, no account  is taken  of differing  soil types  
(apart  from peats).  Nonetheless,  it would  appear  that it is as good  as any other  
extract  and will continue  to be used.  A new series  of trials on 8 different  soil 
types at different  levels of soil P was initiated  at Johnstown  in 1997. This 
investigation  will form  the basis of either  changing  to a different  extractant  or 
to adding  modifications  to Morgan ’s extractant  to cope  with  differing  soil types.  
In order  to cope with the shortcomings  of the Morgans,  a test with relatively  
wide  Index  bands  are used  to cope  with  as wide  a range  of variations  as possible.
Soil indices
When  soils are analysed  for nutrient  status  at Johnstown  Castle,  an index  
system  is used to categorise  them  into differing  soil P levels.  This index  system  
is presented  in Table 1. Agriculture  productivity  is very low at Index 1. The 
productive  species  like perennial  ryegrass  do not thrive  in this Index  and the 
stock  carrying  capacity  of land is this Index  is very poor. If stock  numbers  are 
to be increased,  phosphorus  must  be applied  at high rates in order  to get a full 
yield and to improve  the soil P status.  At Index  4, soil P levels  are very high 
and there is no agronomic  response  to further  phosphorus  fertiliser.  The aim 
of agricultural  productivity  should  be to have soils at Index  2 or Index  3. These  
issues  are discussed  in more detail under  the recommendations  section.

National  trends  in P levels  in soils
As already  noted,  Irish soils were grossly  deficient  in P (<1 mg/1) in the 
1940s  and 1950s  when  systematic^soil  testing  began.  During  the period  1950  
to 1991 the average  P levels  increased  over ten fold to 9.3 mg/1 (Fig. 1). Since  
1991 the levels  have dropped  a little and appear  to have stabilised  around  8 
mg/1.  The average  P content  of samples  received  at the soil laboratory  may not 
precisely  represent  the P status  of the country  for a number  of reasons.  It is 
not known  whether  there  is an undue  preponderance  of samples  from the more  
progressive  farmers  who might  tend to use more fertiliser.  Alternatively,  the 
majority  of the samples  could  have  been taken  from  less fertile  farms  in greater  
need of P which  would  tend to bias the result  downwards.  A random  sample  
of soils was taken  in 1981 (Brogan,  Kelly  and O’Keeffe,  1981)  and when  this 
was compared  with the average  samples  received  at the laboratory  it showed  
that advisory  samples  were 11% higher  in P than the random  sample.  REPS  
farmers  who  are generally  less intensive, have  been  shown to have  more  samples  
at lower  soil P levels  than the average  of the Non-REPS  farmers.  After 1993,  
large  numbers  of samples  have  been  received  from  REPS  farmers  and the recent  
mean  P values  in Figure  1, which  include  many  REPS samples,  may  be somewhat  
low for this reason.
The distribution  of P levels  in soil samples  for grassland  received  at the 
laboratory  from September  1996 to August  1997 is shown  in Table  2. Of the

samples  received,  20% had P levels  in Index  4 and 21% had soil P levels  in 
Index 1. It is quite clear that soils low in P should  be fertilised  if yields  are 
not to be severely  restricted  and there  is no justification  for further  P while  soils  
are in Index  4.
A county  by county  break-down  of the soil fertility  status of the country  
is given in Table  3. This is based  on soil analyses  of samples  received  at the 
laboratory  between  July 1993 and June 1996. The mean P level varies  from  
a high of 11.5 mg/1 in County  Carlow  to a low of 4.6 mg/1 in County  Donegal.  
Maps  showing  the P fertility  distribution  across  the country  have  been  published  
by Coulter  et al, 1996.

Phosphorus  recommendations  for silage
To achieve  optimum  silage  yield the soil P status  should  be adequate  and 
a maintenance  P dressing  should  be applied  to replace  the P that is being  removed  
in the crop.  Research  at Johnstown  Castle  shows  that full grass  production  under

for Clonroche  in 1995 and the corresponding  soil test P for each plot 
(equation  of the line is: y = 10 + 0.33x + 0.11x^-0.02x ’, R^=0.32).
cutting  conditions  can be obtained  at Morgan  soil test P levels  between  4 and 
6 (mg P/1) (soil Index 2), provided  maintenance  P dressings  are applied.
Target  yields  for first and second  cut silage  are 6 and 4 tonnes  dry matter  
per hectare  (t DM/ha),  respectively.  The P removals  for these crops at 0.3%  
P in the herbage  DM were calculated  for a soil at Index  2 (3.1 - 6.0 mg P/1) 
(Table  4).

Therefore,  for a one cut silage  system  18 kg P/ha are required  to replace  
the P removal  (maintenance)  and 30 kg P/ha are required  for a two cut system,  
where  slurry is not recycled.
Calculating  maintenance  P for silage  land
It is recommended  that slurry  from animals  fed on silage  should  be recycled,  
in proportion  to silage  yields,  to the land where  the silage was cut. Table 5 
summarises  the average  amount  of N, P, K available  in slurry.  Where  animals  
are fed 0.5 tonnes  of barley  based  concentrates  (or concentrates  supplemented  
with minerals)  per livestock  unit the recycled  slurry  will satisfy  most of the 
P requirements  of silage  land because  the animals  that consume  the silage  and 
concentrates  remove  only about 30% or less of the P present.  Therefore,  an 
annual  application  of 5.4 and 9 kg/ha  of fertilizer  P should  be adequate  for a
17
one and two cut silage  system,  respectively,  as the annual  maintenance  dressing  
for soils at Index  2. This does not include  P removed  in aftermath  grazing.

P guidelines  for silage  land
In the guidelines  in Tables  6 and 7, Soil Index  2 (3.1 - 6.0 mg p/1) is considered  
adequate  for grass cutting  and subsequent  grazing.  For early grass in silage  
areas we recommend  a soil P level of Index 3 (6.1 - 1 0 mg P/1). To ensure  
optimum  silage  yields  over a range  of soil types the P level should  ideally  be 
at or above  the mid point  of Index  2. Therefore,  an additional  increment  of 5 
kg P/ha should  be used for Index  2 when the soil P level is between  3.1 and 
4 mg/1.  Table  6 summarises  the chemical  P fertilizer  recommendation  for silage  
land where  all slurry  is recycled  to optimize  the P supply.  Additional  P will 
be required  where  no concentrates  are fed and less P will be required  where  
more than 0.5 tonnes  per LU is fed.

are fed and slurry  is recycled  (cut 1 from 50% of farm and cut 2 from 25% of 
that area) (Itinney  et al., 1996).

♦Reduce  these recommendations  by 2 kg/ha for every  0.1 t/LU/yr  increase  above  0.5 
t/LU/year  of concentrates  fed. Equally,  increase  by 2 kg/ha  for each 0.1 1 decrease  below  
0.5 t.
The fertilizer  P for silage  land where  slurry is not recycled  is shown in Table  6. 
To allow for variation  in soils and soil test results,  an insurance  factor  of 
30% more  than removals  is included  in the final recommendations  at Index  2 
shown  in Table  6. For the same reason  a small P fertilizer  input, of the same  
order,  is also recommended  at Index  3 where  slurry  is not recycled  (Table  7).
Farm  Management  Survey
The farm management  data for 1995 were used as the basis for a fertiliser  
use survey  (Murphy, Culleton,  Roche  & Power,  1997).  The farms  were  selected

by the Central  Statistics  Office  on the basis  of farm size and farming  systems.  
The survey  was carried  out on 1226 farms  and every  country  was represented.
The mean  P usage  for silage  and the influences  of various farming  systems  are
outlined  in Table 8.

Mean 20 0.4 972
The mean  P usage  for silage  was 20 kg/ha.  If slurry  was not recycled  onto  
silage  land then P usage  was close to recommended  levels.  However,  it must  
be assumed  that on most farms the slurry was recycled  and in this situation,  
P applications  to silage  were  significantly  higher  than  is agronomically  necessary.  
What  appears  to be happening  on many farms  is that the slurry  is applied  in 
the normal  way and a further  3-4 bags of 0-7-30  are also applied.  The point  
to be made  is that account  should  be taken  of the nutrient  value  of the slurry.  
Fertiliser  should  only be used to top up the shortfall  in requirements  that remains  
when the slurry is applied.
When  slurry  is recycled  the amounts  of P required  are small.  For first cut 
silage,  assuming  normal  fertility,  fertiliser  compounds  like 20;2'/2:5  are very  
useful.  They  can supply  all the N, P and K required.  For second  cuts, products  
like 25:2 ‘/2 :10 can be quite useful.
In silage  areas  where,  for one reason  or another, slurry  is not recycled,  0:7:30  
is still one of the key fertilisers  to be used. In the longer  term, the amount  of 
silage  land that does not receive  slurry will be getting  less and less, and the 
necessity  for products  like 0:7:30  - will presumably  also diminish.
19
Phosphorus  usage  for grazing  
P build-up  in soils
The phosphorus  (P) recommendations  for grazing  are more complex  than 
for silage.  For grazing,  the objective  is to fertilize  pastures  to produce  a grass  
supply  that meets  the demands  of the imposed  stocking  rate (SR) throughout  
the grazing  season.  At high SR, optimum  grass production  is required  from  
pastures  compared  with lower  stocking  rates where  grass production  targets  
will be lower.  In general,  farmers  manipulate  the grass supply  with nitrogen  
(N) fertilizer.  However,  P plays an important  role in determining  the annual  
pattern  and total grass  yields  from  grazed  grass.  Therefore,  optimizing  fertilizer  
P inputs  is an important  variable  in maximizing  the production  efficiency  of 
any animal  production  system  based  on grazed  grass.
When  soil P levels  are in Index I, there is little scope  for improvements  in 
productivity.  The productive  grasses like perennial  ryegrass  simply  do not survive  
at this level of soil P, while  grasses  like Agrostis  thrive  in these  impoverished  
situations.  If stock  numbers  are to be increased,  it is imperative  the soil P levels  
be improved  significantly.
Conway,  McLoughlin  and Murphy  (1972)  demonstrated  this very clearly  in 
a study  using  old permanent  pastures  for sheep  and cattle  production  systems  
in Ballintubber,  Co. Roscommon.  It was shown  that when  P was applied  to an 
impoverished  soil over  a four  year  period  and improved  management  strategies  
implemented  that the stocking  rate of cattle and sheep could be increased  
resulting  in a four fold increase  in liveweight  gain between  the first and the 
fourth  year. There  was a major  change  in botanical  composition  in the sward  
over the same period  (Table  9).

A long term grazing  trial (Cowlands  trial) at Johnstown  demonstrated  this 
change  in botanical  composition  from  a different  point  of view.  A beef  grazing  
trial was commenced  in 1968, when 0, 15 and 30 kg P/ha were applied  to a 
soil at a P level of 6 mg/L.  At the commencement  of the trial the sward  was 
dominated  by perennial  ryegrass.  In the zero P treatment  the botanical  
composition  deteriorated  as the P levels  dropped.  In 1997 the P levels  in the 
zero P plots  were  2.0 (mg/1)  and the plots were  dominated  by Agrostis  species.  
Swards  in the higher  P treatments  are still dominated  by perennial  ryegrass.
It can be concluded  that if reasonable  productivity  is to be achieved,  it is 
imperative  that P be applied  in sufficient  quantities  to move the soil out of 
Index 1.
Work  at Johnstown  Castle  suggests  that at Index  2 the perennial  ryegrass  
can be maintained  in the sward  and reasonable  levels  of productivity  can be 
achieved.  At stocking  rates significantly  below  the stock  carrying  capacity  of 
the land there will be sufficient  grass produced  at Index  2. However  if there  
are aspirations  to further  increase  stocking  rates, P should  be applied  at rates  
that will move the soil out of Index 2 into Index 3.
The Cowlands  trial showed  that a soil P Index  of 3 (6.1 - 10.0 mg P/1) is 
required  for optimum  production  of grazed  grass. Therefore,  when farmers  
require  all the grass that the system  has the potential  to produce.  Index 3 is 
the target soil fertility  level. Recent  and current  grazing  trials at Taranaki  
Agricultural  Research  Station  in New Zealand  also support  this conclusion.  
This contrasts  with the results  from cutting  trials where  Index  2 is adequate.  
The reasons  for the differences  between  the results  of the grazing  and cutting  
trials cannot,  as yet, be explained.  However,  tentative  explanations  are as 
follows:-  the uneven  distribution  of dung pats as well as lower  efficiency  of 
P returns  in the dung pats from grazing  compared  with uniform  distribution  
of fertilizer  P in the cutting  trials.  Other  possible  reasons  are the necessity  for 
extra  P to ensure  that there is out-of-season  grass in grazing  systems;  the high  
tiller  density  with subsequent  increased  rooting  of grazing  systems  as opposed  
to silage  systems;  the higher  frequency  of defoliation  gives rise to increased  
root activity  and hence  higher  P requirements;  higher  P offtakes  in grazing  
systems.  The dietary  requirements  of dairy  cows  is another  factor  that must  be 
taken into account  and this is covered  in the section  on P levels  in herbage.
There  is some  evidence  in the literature  which  suggests  that soil with  Morgan ’s 
P levels  of < 4 mg/1 will restrict  grass  growth  in spring.  Murphy  (1977)  showed  
that P applied  in autumn/early  spring  gave 200 kg DM/ha  more grass in late 
March  than when no P was applied  at soil P levels  of 4 mg/1.  A new trial has 
been initiated  to verify this effect.  Preliminary  results  indicate  there was a 
significant  grass DM response  in March  and April at a soil P level of 2 mg/ 
1. There  was a significant  response  to 45 kg P /ha in April at soil P of 4 mg/ 
1. There  were  no differences  at higher  soil P levels.  These  results  are supported  
by New Zealand  work which  showed  a seasonal  response  at low Olsen ’s P 
(5-15 mgA)  compared  with no response  at higher  P soil levels  (Roberts,  1987).  
When  early grass is required  for grazing  be it in silage  or in grazing  ground  
Index 3 is the target soil fertility  level.
21
The quantities  of P required  to change  soil P levels  by 1 mg/1 is difficult  
to predict,  as it depends  on soil type and soil P level. It can take from 10 to 
more  than 100 kg P/ha to move  the available  P by one point  depending  on the 
soil. In light sandy  soils,  P levels  can be reduced  rapidly,  while  in heavier  soils  
it can take up to and maybe  more  than 100 kg of P removed  to drop the P by 
one point.  It is further  complicated  by the level  of P already  in the soil.  Available  
soil P of 20 mg/1 can be lowered  to 19 by the removal  of approximately  10- 
30 kg P/ha. It could  take the removal  of greater  than 100 kg P/ha to move  the 
available  P level from 5 to 4 mg/1.
If approximate  calculations  are to be made,  a figure  of say 40 kg P to 
change  the Morgan ’s P by one point  can be used e.g. to go from Morgan ’s P 
11 to 10 will need a net removal  from the soil of 40 kg P. At a stocking  rate 
2.5 LU/ha,  this will take approximately  3-4 years.
Phosphorus  can be applied  with equal  effectiveness  in autumn,  in spring  or 
in smaller  amounts  at frequent  applications  throughout  the year. At Index 1 
where  there are responses  to P, autumn  application  is beneficial.  Phosphorus  
in cold conditions  is less available  to plant  roots and if early  grass  is required,  
there  needs  to be a relatively  rich supply  of P. At Index  3, there  is no advantage  
to autumn  as opposed  to early spring  application.
P maintenance  in soils
The soil P levels  should  be adequate  to support  the required  level of grass  
production.  Once  the desirable  soil P level is attained  a maintenance  dressing  
of P should  be applied  to replace  the P that is being  removed  in animal  product  
and other unavoidable  losses.  Bertilsson  and Forsberg  (1997)  indicated  that 
when an adequate  level of soil fertility  is attained,  optimum  yields can be 
maintained  by replacing  the P that is removed  from  the farm system. Therefore,  
P is required  to replace  the nutrients  exported  off the farm in animal  product,  
P fixed by the soil and other losses  from roadways.
Phosphorus  recommendations  for grazing
Teagasc  P fertilizer  recommendations  for grazing  are based  on two principles  
1) Soil P must be built up to desirable  soil P levels,  as rapidly  and as 
economically  as possible.
Once  this level  has been achieved,  soil P levels  are maintained  by replacing
what is removed  or lost from the farm system.
As already  stated.  Index  1 represents  a state  of impoverishment  and if serious  
farming  is to be conducted,  it is imperative  that soil P levels  be built-up.  Table  
11 summarises  the guidelines  for P build-up  to either  Index  2 or Index 3.
Table 11

As already  stated,  Index  3 is the desired  soil P level for farming  at or near 
the stock carrying  capacity  of the soil. This level ensures  optimum  yields,  
satisfactory  grass growth  at both ends of the season  and ensures  that there is 
adequate  P in the herbage  to meet the dietary  requirements  of cows in most  
situations.  Once  this P status  is achieved,  P offtakes  should  be balanced  by P 
fertiliser.
A cow results  in the removal  of approximately  5 kg P per grazing  season.  
Therefore,  the amount  of P removed  is determined  by stocking  rate. Table 12 
outlines  the removals  at a range  of stocking  rates.  A number  of assumptions  
were  made  in calculating  these  offtakes  and these  are summarised  in Appendix
1.

The 5 kg/cow  removals  were made  on the basis of a milk yield of 5000  L/ 
cow. Table 13 shows  the offtakes  for a range  of milk yields  and stocking  rates.  
Changes  in milk yield of 1000 t/cow  would  mean a change  of 2.3 kg P/ha in 
the recommendations.

There  are situations  where  Index  3 P levels  are not required.  Irish soils have  
been classified  in terms of their stock carrying  capacity  (Lee and Diamond,  
1972)  and many  farmers  are stocked  below  the potential  of the soils. It is quite  
reasonable  that Index  2 P level is quite  sufficient  in this situation.  The amounts  
of P required  to maintain  the soil P test at Index  2 will be somewhat  greater  
than those  removed  by stock,  as there will be some  long-term  immobilisation  
of P by the soil. Table 14 outlines  the considerations  that can be taken into 
account  when deciding  whether  to opt for Index 2 or 3.

In REPS,  Index  3 is required  for stocking  rates at or near the limits  allowed  
for REPS  rates because  of the restrictions  in N use and the need for a good  
grass/clover  sward  for summer  grazing.
A summary  of the guidelines  for P when  Index  3 is the target  is summarised  
in Table 15.

Phosphorus  recommendations  for grazing  are complex.  There are still 
considerable  gaps  in our knowledge.  It is quite  possible  that as new information  
becomes  available  from the Johnstown  Castle  dairy trial and from new trials  
on the responses  to P over  a range  of soil types  and fertility,  the recommendations  
will be modified.
Nonetheless,  these recommendations,  which  are based on stocking  rates,  
targeted  soil fertility  levels  and offtakes,  are significantly  more focused  than 
previous  recommendations.  They  are also more  precise  and it should  be pointed  
out that when these recommendations  are followed,  it is vital to monitor  the 
P status  in the soil. Soil testing  should  be used not only to monitor  the amounts  
of fertilizer  needed  to ensure  optimum  yields  but also to ensure  that satisfactory  
soil P levels  are maintained.  In the light  of reduced  fertiliser  recommendations,  
it is vital that the soil be tested.  It is essential  that the following  protocol  for 
soil testing  is followed  correctly.
Protocol  for soil sampling
1. Map out discrete  areas of the farm that are uniform  in soil type, slope,  
drainage  and cropping  history.
2. Take a composite  sample  consisting  of 20 individual  cores  in each  designated  
area.
24
3. Cores  should  be taken to a depth  of 10 cm.
4. The cores should  be taken in “W” shape across  the sampling  area.
5. Avoid  unusual  spots like old fences,  ditches,  water  troughs  and gateways.
6. Avoid  dung  and urine  patches,  avoid  where  fertiliser  was stored  or spilled.
7. Do not sample  a field for P and K until 6 months  after last application  of 
fertiliser.  Do not sample  a field  for lime requirement  until  2 years  after  lime  
application.
8. Sample  at the same time of year on each sampling  occasion.
9. Sample  every 3 years in intensive  farming.
10. Sample  every 4-5 years in more extensive  farming.
11. Fill in the Soil  Identification  form  completely  (including  details  on texture).
12. Enter  map grid number  of each soil sample  identification  form.
13. To get a recommendation,  as well as nutrient  status statement,  include  
information  on crop to be harvested  and stocking  rates.
Fertiliser  use survey
The fertiliser  use survey  also examined  the use of P on grazing  areas and 
the results  are summarised  in Table  16. The table  shows  clearly  that the dairying  
sector  are the most  intensive  users  of P, while  cattle  rearing  farmers  use in the 
order  of 9 kg P/ha.  The farmers  with  pigs and poultry  obviously  use their  manures  
as they use only 4 kg/ha  of fertiliser  P. As stocking  rates increased,  the usage  
of P also increased.  However,  when comparing  the usage to the 
recommendations,  it is clear that at all stocking  rates recorded,  the usage  is 
somewhat  above  recommendations.  This  is especially  true at the more  extensive  
stocking  rates.

For Index  2 or 3 soils fertilisers  like 18:6:12,  0:10:20,  10:10:20,  27:272:5  
are all still very useful.  For extensive  dry stocking  farming  a new fertiliser  is 
being  manufactured  this year which  should  be very useful,  in that the amount  
of P has been reduced  a little,  while  the amounts  of K has remained  the same.  
The formulation  of this new product  is 18:4:12.  It is likely  that this product  
will be useful  in many  farms  that are currently  spreading  a little too much  P 
each year. This product  will be especially  useful  in extensive  beef farming  
provided  the grass is kept in the vegetative  stage.
There  is a movement  towards  using high N products,  thereby  spreading  
small  amounts  of P and K during  the grazing  season  when  the crop  needs  them.  
This is a trend that is likely  to continue  and it has the added  advantage  that 
this type of fertiliser  can be environmentally  friendly  in that only relatively  
small amounts  of P are being applied  at any one time and the risk of runoff  
is therefore  being reduced.
Herbage  P levels
One of the major  concerns  in this P debate  is the level of P in herbage.  A 
P trial is currently  being  conducted  in the dairy  at Johnstown  Castle.  The objective  
of the trial is to determine  the minimum  soil P level at which  dairying  can be 
carried  out efficiently.  The long term target  is to have 3 herds  of 21 cows  each  
grazing  soils with differing  P levels.  Herd 1 will be grazed  and fed silage  from  
soils with a P level of 2-4 mg/1. Herds  2 and 3 will be managed  similarly  on 
soils with P levels  of 6-8 and 11-12  (mg/1),  respectively.  At that stage,  similar  
maintenance  dressings  of P will be applied  to all treatments.
In 1996 Herd 1 land had soils around  4.7 and this received  no P fertiliser.  
Herd  2 land had soil P levels  of 8.5 and received  maintenance  dressings  of 13 
kg P/ha. Herd 3 land had P levels  of 10-12 mg/1 and received  20 kg P/ha.
The P in herbage  was recorded  pre-grazing,  throughout  the growing  season.  
The results  are summarised  in Table 18. While 1997 data are not complete,  
preliminary  results  suggest  that the P levels  in herbage  are not dissimilar  to 
1996.

Soil P 12.0 .43 .51 .43 .39 .32 .38 .31 .50 .41
In general  terms,  on well grazed  grassland  percentage  P remained  at reasonable  
levels  on a range of soil P levels  between  approximately  5 and 10 mg/1.
On silage  land the results  were somewhat  different  and in general  P 
concentrations  in silage  were lower  than in the grazing  sward  (Table  19). This  
may result from a dilution  effect i.e. as the grass yields  increase,  the P 
concentration  declines.

At the higher  soil and fertiliser  P levels,  the P concentrations  in first  cut silage  
were higher  than when the soil P levels  were low. The second  cut silage  had 
lower  P levels  than the first cut.
Fleming  and Murphy  (1968)  conducted  a series  of cutting  trials in the late 
1960s.  When  no phosphorus  was applied  to ryegrass  cut 9 times  during  the year,  
P levels  remained  around  0.3%.  When  21 kg P/ha was applied  %P started  in 
spring  at 0.6% and dropped  to 0.5% in late summer.  In silage  swards  P level  
fell to approximately  0.25%  in late May/early  June.
Table  20 summarises  the percentage  P in herbage  from the Cowlands  trial.  
There  were 3 phosphorus  treatments,  PO, P15 and P30 kg/ha  applied  annually  
at two stocking  rates, 1800 and 2400 kg liveweight  at turnout  in spring.  This  
shows  the P concentration  was reasonably  high  in all treatments  and at all stocking  
rates.  There  were  no real differences  in P levels  between  stocking  rates.  Herbage  
P levels  in the control  plots (PO) were quite high but were not as high as the 
P levels  in the PI5 and P30 plots.

These  results  suggest  that percentage  phosphorus  in grazed  herbage  is in the 
order  of 0.37-0.45%  provided  the grass  is well managed  and kept in the leafy  
vegetative  stage.  The P concentration  can be kept at this level over a range  of 
soil P levels  ranging  from  5 to 10 mg/1.  In general  terms,  these  levels  are adequate  
to meet  the dietary  requirements  of lactating  cows.  For very  high yields  it may  
be necessary  to supplement  with additional  P if there is a shortfall  in intake  
of P.
Future  phosphorus  research
1. There  is little doubt  that the soil P test is not adequate  for all soil types  and 
all situations.  It is primarily  useful  in giving  guidelines  as to the P status  
of the soil. A new trial started  in 1997 on thirty sites around  the country  
will hopefully  shed new light on responses  to P, as well as bringing  new 
information  about  Morgan ’s P test and other possible  new soil P tests.
2. Quantification  of pathways  of P loss from agriculture  to water.  The 
production  of an easy to use methodology  of assessing  the risk of P loss 
to the environment  is required.  Factors  to be considered  are soil types,  soil 
P level slope,  rainfall,  drainage  systems  and proximity  to water.  The 
contribution  of farmyards  and slurry  needs  to be clarified.  Some  areas  are 
more  vulnerable  to P loss than others.  Knowledge  of these  vulnerable  zones  
and how to define  them  could  greatly  help in devising  strategies  to reduce  
P losses.
3. More  detailed  work  on soil chemistry  is required.  We need to know  more  
about  the fate of fertiliser  P when it is applied  to soils, we need to know  
more  about  how it reacts  with the organic  and inorganic  matter  in the soil, 
we need  to know  more  on the role of pH, the timing  and rate of application,  
and the interaction  with nitrogen  and other  elements.
4. Role of organic  phosphorus  in contributing  to pasture  production  and the 
study  of the factors  which  affect  the mineralisation  of organic  P throughout  
the season  in different  soils.
5. Role of livestock  units in determining  offtakes  needs to be elucidated  
further.
Conclusions
The phosphorus  recommendations  in this paper  are based on the best 
information  available.  There  is a considerable  amount  of work  being  conducted  
on P at national  and international  level and there is a possibility  that there  will 
be further  revisions  in the management  of soil P levels  in the future.  There  is 
evidence  for reduction  in soil P levels  while still ensuring  optimum  growth.  
Two points  must be made.  Firstly,  it will be difficult  to reduce  soil P levels  
any further  without  significant  improvements  in soil testing  methodology.  
Secondly,  it must be remembered  that grass is an intermediate  product;  it is 
the nutritional  requirements  of the ruminant  that is paramount.  Any future  
changes  in P recommendations  must ensure  that the P in the grazed  grass is 
sufficient  to meet the dietary  requirements  of the cows.

APPENDIX  1
Assumptions  Made  in Calculating  Offakes  in Dairy  System
1) P content  of milk = 0.9 g/kg.
2) Cull cows.
1 kg liveweight  = 8.0 g P 
Replacement  rate = 20%
Mean weight  = 500 kg
Mean weight  of replacement  heifers  = 500 kg
3) Calves  are sold off in dairying  at a mean  weight  of 50 kg and the P content  
is 8 g/kg liveweight.  Some  20%  of the weight  of the foetus  at birth  is gained  
during  the grazing  season.
4) There  is a loss of P in dung  while  cows are not in the paddocks.  This has 
been calculated  at 1.8 kg/cow/yr  (Morton,  1984).  However,  much  of this 
loss occurs  in the milk  parlours  and yards  and this is either  recycled  directly  
to some  field as soiled  water  or it is washed  into the slurry  storage  areas.  
Thus  the P lost to the system  is that contained  in the dung  which  is deposited  
on farm roadways.  This can be lost to rivers,  streams  and lakes when  rain 
washes  it off the roadways.  This is calculated  as 0.18 kg/cow  (3 hours  off 
the paddocks  per day during  the grazing  season,  at intake  of 16 kg DM/  
day = 1.8 kg P/cow,  10% of that time on roadways).
5) The amount  of P fixation  and soil P release  is difficult  to quantify.  At 
maintenance  P levels  in Index  3, for the purposes  of these  calculations,  we 
have assumed  zero fixation.  An arbitrary  allowance  of 2 kg/ha  P over and 
above  maintenance  is allowed  at Index 2.
6) The removals  of P take into account  that enough  silage  is made to give 
adequate  feed during  the winter  months.
7) All calculations  are based  on a spring  calving  herd.  The requirements  would  
be lower  for an autumn  calving  herd.

Grassland  Management  - The Effect  
on Herd Performance
M. O’DONOVAN,  P. DILLON  and G. STAKELUM  
Teagasc,  Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
Current  changes  in agricultural  policy  and future  expected  changes  will 
continue  to remove  the relatively  high level of protection  engaged  by the EU 
countries.  Market  forces  are likely  to determine  producers  returns  much  more  
in the future.  With lower  milk price and the possibility  of increased  milk  
production  (no - quotas)  Irish  dairy  farmers  will have  to become  more  efficient  
producers  of milk. Grazing  grass  in situ at a reasonable  level of utilisation  will 
remain  the simplest  and most  efficient  method  of milk production.  With good  
grazing  management  we can have  a long grazing  season  with high quality  feed 
available  at low cost. A research  programme  was set up in Moorepark  in the 
Autumn  of 1995 to investigate  if increased  measurement  at farm level could  
influence  the performance  being  obtained  from  grazed  grass.  The farms  selected  
were intensive  dairy farms which  were already  achieving  above  average  
performance.  The increased  performance  would  result  in improved  financial  
returns.  The measurements  that would  have most influence  on performance  
were:
(1) Pasture  cover
(2) Post-grazing  sward  height
(3) Pasture  quality
(4) Cow condition  score
Other  measurements  which  were already  being  monitored  on these farms  
included  milk yield,  milk  composition,  cow fertility  performance,  concentrate  
input  and silage  quality  and yield.  Thirteen  dairy herds  were initially  selected  
for this project.  All herds  were  visited  twice  monthly  from  March  to September  
and once monthly  for the remainder  of the year. All four measurements  were  
taken  on each  visit.  The grazing  management  practises  of these  farms  have  now  
being monitored  for two and a half years.  The questions  being  asked  in the 
project  are: (1) What  major  deficiencies  in terms  of grazing  management  have  
been identified  on these farms?  (2) Has the use of more measurements  been  
a benefit  in correcting  these deficiencies?  (3) What  are the recommendations  
arising  from these measurements?
(1) Pasture  cover
Pasture  cover  is defined  as the total supply  of available  grass  (>4cm)  on all 
the paddocks  which  are available  for grazing.  Paddocks  closed  for silage  are 
not included.  Four main areas were identified  where  a knowledge  of pasture  
cover  was of significant  benefit.
(a) Closing  cover  in late November/early  December.  Figure  1 shows  closing  
average  farm covers  for six Spring  calving  herds  over the last 3 years  (1995-
31
Fig. 1 - Average  pasture  cover  at closing  in Autumn  for six Spring  
Calving  Herds  1995 - 1997.
1997).  The figure  clearly  shows  large increases  in closing  cover  over the past 
3 years.  The benefit  seen at farm level of an increased  closing  cover  is a much  
increased  Spring  grass  supply.  Increasing  opening  Spring  cover  demands  a higher  
level of utilisation  by earlier  turnout  and making  more grass available  during  
the first cycle.  The results  also showed  that grazing  very large  covers  (>2800  
kg DM/ha)  in the last grazing  rotation  was detrimental  for perennial  ryegrass  
survival  and grass supply  the following  Spring.
Therefore  the main  findings  concerning  pasture  closing  cover  were:
(i) Farm  grass  cover  should  be >350  kg DM/ha  with a range  in paddock  cover  
of 200 - 800 kg DM/ha.
(ii) The farm  should  be closed  in rotation,  with  the first  paddock  closed  between  
the 10th - 15th of October.
(iii) By the end of the first week  of November  60%  of the farm  should  be closed  
and all grazing  should  cease by late November.
(iv) Large covers  >2000kg  DM/ha  should  be avoided  on the last grazing  
rotation.
(b) Opening  pasture  cover  in the Spring
The benefit  of grazed  grass  as part of the diet in early lactation  with Spring
32
calving  dairy cows has long been identified.  It is not possible  to suggest  one 
turnout  date for all dairy farms.  This will very much  depend  on grass supply,  
stocking  rate, calving  pattern,  soil type and the implication  of other  enterprises  
on the farm. It also has implications  on target  Mean  Calving  Date.  The project  
has identified  that a knowledge  of pasture  cover  can be used  to make  maximum  
use of grazed  grass  from  mid February  to late April.  Figure  2 shows  the average  
turnout  cover  on six Spring  calving  herds for the last 3 years.
It is evident  from the data that considerable  improvement  has taken  place  
on these farms with regard  to pasture  cover  at turnout  in late February/early  
March.  Figure  3 shows  how turnout  with very low pasture  cover  can actually  
reduce  the amount  of grass utilised  over the Spring.  Whereas  if turnout  takes  
place at the proper  cover  the grass available  can be maximised  in the cow ’s 
diet. However  over the past two Springs  the former  has been the situation  on 
some  dairy  farms  where  turnout  was too late and optimised  use of Spring  grass  
was not achieved.
Fig. 3 - The effect  of two levels  of pasture  cover  at turnout  on 
subsequent  Spring  cover.
Tables  1 and 2 show feed budgets  for two contrasting  farms.  For the purpose  
of comparison  the two farms  were 100 cow herds  with similar  calving  patterns.  
Farm  1 has access  to 40 ha (100  acres)  of grazing  area,  while  Farm  2 has access  
to 22 ha (54 acres).  Both farms  have a turnout  cover  of 600 kg DM/ha.  The 
farms  have  different  turnout  dates  and turnout  only occurs  when  the cows  can 
be allowed  6 kg DM/cow.  Both of these farms  have a target  cover  of 800 kg 
DM/ha  on the grazing  area in mid April at similar  stocking  rates. Because  of 
the larger  grazing  area, a lot more grass can be allocated  to the cows in Farm  
1, Farm  2 cannot  turnout  as early or allow  the same level of grass because  of 
the grazing  area  constraint.  From  turnout  until mid April  Farm  1 is able to allow  
a total of 1.0 t grass/DM/cow,  while  Farm  2 can only allow  0.62 t grass/DM/  
cow. This shows  the benefit  of using  pasture  cover  measurement  to exploit  the 
extra grass which  is available  because  of the lower  stocking  rate and earlier  
turnout.

The main  finding  regarding  turnout  date and budgeting  of the feed:
(i) Turnout  should  begin  with a pasture  cover  of 550-600  kg DM/ha  at 2.75 
cows/ha,  lower  turnout  covers  are possible  at lower  stocking  rates.
(ii) The available  feed should  then be budgeted,  and the first rotation  should  
finish  between  the 10th-20th  April  (the day grass  supply  equals  grass  demand).  
This date can vary from year to year. The precise  date to finish  the round  can 
only be found  by careful  monitoring  of pasture  supply.
(iii) Pasture  cover  target  on the 20th April should  be 750 - 800 kg DM/ha  
at a stocking  rate of 4.5 cows/ha  on the grazing  area
(c) IdentiHcation  of surpluses  and deficits
The results  from the study have shown  that cow performance  can be 
influenced  by early identification  of a surplus  or a deficit  grass supply  with 
the use of pasture  cover  measurement.  An extremely  steep wedge  pattern  of 
grass supply  (going  from 350 to 3000kg  DM/ha)  indicates  an oversupply  of 
grass. Grazing  large covers  during  the main grazing  season  (>2500  kg DM/  
ha) will often result  in reduced  milk production  or necessitate  topping  large  
residuals.  In the lead up to a period of a grass  shortage  pre-cutting  some  paddocks
34
would  facilitate  better  utilisation  of large pre-grazing  yields  especially  in dry 
weather  conditions.  The reaction  on most  dairy  farms  to large  pre-grazing  yields  
of grass was to remove  the surplus  grass as silage.  If silage  harvesting  was 
delayed  then it resulted  in (a) reduced  pasture  cover  (b) increased  stocking  rate 
on the grazing  area. Farmers  that delayed  harvesting  these surplus  paddocks  
generally  had a grass shortage  in the next rotation.  Using  pasture  cover in 
conjunction  with grass DM available  per cow and a forecast  of future  grass  
growth  rates over the following  7 to 10 days will allow better  management  
decisions  to be made.
If grass  growth  rates are below  normal  and/or  stocking  rate too high a less 
pronounced  wedge  shaped  grass  supply  pattern  will result.  Cows  will be going  
into paddocks  with low covers  (<1500  kg DM/ha).  Running  covers  down  to 
very low levels  will result in even more reduced  grass growth  rates at farm  
level and will generally  result  in the under  feeding  of the cows.  Pasture  cover  
measurements  will identify  a future  problem  with  grass  supply  before  pre-grazing  
yield will. Therefore  the use of pasture  cover measurement  will allow  
management  decisions  to be put in place at an earlier  stage i.e. stocking  rate 
can be adjusted  or supplements  can be introduced.
The main  findings  regarding  identification  of surplus/deficits  are:
(i) Pasture  cover  should  be maintained  at 900 -950 kg DM/ha  or 200 kg DM/  
cow on the grazing  area during  the main grazing  season.
If pasture  cover  increases  to greater  than 1000 kg DM/ha  from mid April  
to mid July the surplus  grass should  be removed  as silage.  The surplus  
paddocks  should  be harvested  as silage  at day 21 to 25 in the rotation,  
(iii) With a decreasing  pasture  cover,  the herd should  be supplemented  or the 
grazing  area should  be increased  by including  some  silage  paddocks.  This  
should  be introduced  early enough  so as not to let the pasture  cover  drop  
below  700 kg DM/ha.
(d) Obtaining  high performance
Figure  4 shows  the average  daily allowance  of grass for 6 Spring  calving(ii)

35
Fig. 5 - Average  milk yield and milk protein  production  for six Spring

herds over  the grazing  season  of 1997.  The  data  indicate  that the lowest  allowance  
of grass occurred  in the late April to early June period.  This is the period  of 
peak milk production  and also coincides  with the breeding  season.  Figure  5 
shows  the milk production  profde  for the six Spring  calving  herds.  In 1997,  
average  milk production  in kg milk/cow/day  was 28.0, 25.3, 24.2, 23.1, 19.5,  
16.9 for the months  of April, May,  June,  July,  August  and September  respectively.  
The average  reduction  in milk yield  from  April  to May (2.7kg  milk/cow),  May  
to June  (1.1kg  milk/cow),  June  to July (1.1kg  milk/cow),  July to August  (3.6kg  
milk/cow),  August  to September  (2.6kg  milk/cow),  September  to October  (3.3kg  
milk/cow),  October  to November  (4.5kg  milk/cow).  The mean  calving  date for 
these herds was March  1st. Therefore  peak milk production  should  occur  in 
May.  The milk production  data show  a large  milk yield  reduction  in May. This 
reflects  inadequate  feeding  which  can be seen in Figure  4 with the low grass  
allowance  and the use of very little supplement.  The factor  that will create  the 
largest  pressure  on grass  supply  in this period  is the stocking  rate on the grazing  
area. Stocking  rates of 5 cows/ha  or greater  are too high unless  large levels  
of supplerrient  are being  fed. Some  farms on the study  carried  very high  stocking  
rates during  this period  and very little supplements  were fed. Table  3 shows  
the daily allowance  of grass and the availability  of grass per cow (kgs DM/  
cow = Pasture  cover/stocking  rate) at varying  stocking  rate using average  
Moorepark  grass growth  rates (1990-1996)  from April 22 to May 27.

36
The major  findings  with regard to obtaining  high  performance  from  grazed  
grass:
(i) A stocking  rate of 4.5 cows/ha  from mid April to early  June is sufficient  
to maintain  the correct  balance  of pasture  supply  and grass allowance  to 
adequately  feed cows at pasture.
(ii) Very high stocking  rates (>5 cows/ha)  from  mid April  to June  will result  
in inadequate  grass  supply and  result  in underfeeding  of cows  unless  large levels  
of supplement  are fed.
(2) Post-grazing  sward  height
The degree  to which  any paddock  is grazed  is a function  of grass  availability  
versus  herd requirement.  Table  4 outlines  the post-grazing  height  that results  
from  different  grazing  intensities.  If a paddock  is grazed  to a post-grazing  height  
of 4cm, then the grass intake  of the herd will be very much  reduced.  If on the 
other  hand a pasture  is grazed  to a post-grazing  height  of 8cm, intake  will be 
high but a large level of grass will be wasted.  On some farms post-grazing  
height  ranged  from 4.5 to 5.5cm  for a large part of the grazing  season.

3 5.5 - 6.5 good grazing
4 6.5 - 7.5 under-grazed
5 >7.5 grossly  under-grazed
Figure  6 shows  the post-grazing  height  and corresponding  grass  allowance  
over the year for one of the Spring  calving  herds on the study. In this case,  
there  was an inadequate  grass  allowance  and a low grazing  intensity.  Low  post­
grazing  height  could be the results  of two situations  at farm level.
(i) Low pasture  cover  as a result  of below  normal  grass growth  rates or too 
high a stocking  rate.
(ii) Even with adequate  pasture  cover  daily allocation  of grass may not be 
adequate.
Both of these  two situations  were recorded  at farm level.  Low post-grazing  
height  as a result  of low pasture  cover  generally  occurred  in the mid April to 
June period.  This was mainly  as a result  of too high a stocking  density  (5 to 
5.5 cows/ha)  where  the farmer  attempted  to maintain  a 21 day rotation  with  
very little supplementation.  It also occurs  during  the main grazing  season  in 
periods  of below  normal  grass growing  conditions  where no adjustment  in 
stocking  rate occurred  and no supplements  were fed. Low post-grazing  heights  
with adequate  pasture  cover  also occurred.  This took place generally  where  
grass  was being  allocated  on a 12 hour basis  (after  each milking)  at farm level.  
A 24 hour allocation  may be more conducive  to achieving  higher  intakes  of

grass.  At farm level there was over emphasis  placed  on achieving  extremely  
high grass utilisation.
The main  findings  on the monitoring  of post-grazing  sward  heights  were:
(i) Very  low post-grazing  height  was much  more  evident  on the farms  studied  
rather  than high post-grazing  heights.
(ii) The main  reason  for very low post-grazing  height  was very high stocking  
rates with low pasture  cover.
(iii) Very low post-grazing  height  also occurred  with adequate  pasture  cover  
where  over emphasis  was placed  on achieving  high utilisation  to the 
detriment  of cow performance.
(3) Pasture  quality
The measurement  of pasture  quality  which  was used in this study was the 
measurement  of the proportion  of green  leaf available  in the sward  (>4cm).  
Moorepark  studies  have  shown  a direct  relationship  between  proportion  of green  
leaf  and digestibility.  For optimum  milk  production  the proportion  of green  leaf 
should  be >65% of DM available. Most  farms  achieved  very  high  quality  pastures  
over the grazing  season.  However  there were a number  of situations  at farm  
level where  the proportion  of the sward  decreased  below  65% green  leaf. These  
were:
(i) Where  rotation  length  was in excess  of 25 days in mid May/June,  30 days  
in July/August  and 40 days in September.
(ii) In periods  of below normal  grass growth  rates and in semi-drought  
conditions  where  large amounts  of stem development  were evident.
(iii) In pastures  which  contained  less than 50% ryegrass.  These  pastures  had 
generally  lower  pasture  quality  throughout  the grazing season.  The greatest

Spring  calving  herds.
The main  findings  with regard  to pasture  quality  were:
(i) ■■ ■
(ii)Most  farms  maintained  veryTiigh  pasture  quality  over the grazing  season.  
This was achieved  by not leaving  large residuals  after  the previous  grazing  
and using pasture  topping,  if required.
The main  reason  for reduced  pasture  quality  was  an extended  rotation  length  
for the time of year.
(4) Cow condition  score
Body  fat reserves  are important  for the dairy  cow. Immediately  after  calving,  
the cow ’s capacity  to consume  energy in feed  does  not keep  pace  with  the amount  
of energy  being  used for milk production.  This is even more important  in very 
high producing  cows.  Therefore,  the cow must  draw  on body  reserves  to make  
up the difference.  A cow with good body reserves  may be in a better  position  
to support  milk  production  and may  have  better  subsequent  fertility  performance.  
There  are three periods  in the year when condition  score is important.
(a) Drying  off/end  of lactation,  (b) At calving,  (c) Start  of breeding  season
(a) It is important  to monitor  condition  score towards  the end of lactation.  
Condition  score can be easily modified  at this stage by either  adjusting  the 
length  of the dry period  or the level of feeding  during  this period.  Average  herd  
condition  score at the end of lactation  should  be around  3.
(b) Condition  score at calving  is important  and will influence  the level of 
supplementation  during  early  lactation.  TTie target  herd  condition  score  at calving  
is 3.5. In early lactation,  when energy  intake  is less than current  requirement  
for milk production,  condition  score manipulation  may be difficult.
(c) It is important  that cows  are in good  condition  at the start of the breeding  
season  and that this is maintained  throughout  the breeding  season.  A target
39
condition  score  of 2.9 at the start of the breeding  season  with Spring  calving  
dairy cows should  be the aim. Table  5 shows  the average  condition  score for 
two Spring  calving  herds  of similar  genetic  merit  in the herds  monitored.  Table  
6 shows  the fertility  performance  for the same  two herds. While  it is not possible  
from  this study  to make  a definite  cause/effect  relationship,  it does indicate  that
there is a large difference  in fertility  performance  as well as herd condition  
scores  between  both herds.

Conclusion
This paper  clearly  outlines  the large  benefit  obtained  at farm level from an 
increased  use of measurement.  Measurements  will allow  dairy  farmers  to achieve  
much  higher  levels  of performance  from  grazed  grass.  They  also allow  research  
findings  to be more  readily  adopted  at farm level.  With the increased  use and 
focus on discussion  groups  as a method  of technology  transfer,  these  
measurements  are essential  and should  be an integral  part of the discussions.

Dairy Cattle  Breeding  in Ireland  - 
The Way Forward
B. WICKHAM
Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation,  Bandon,  Co. Cork.
In this paper I will cover:
• The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation ’s mission,  membership  and method  
of operation.  The Federation  has been established  to lead the way forward.
• Co-operation  is one of the fundamental  elements  required  for successful  
cattle  breeding.  Co-operation  between  farmers,  cattle  breeders,  AI services,  milk  
recording  organisations,  breed associations  and animal  evaluation  units is 
essential  if the potential  benefits  of cattle breeding  are to be fully exploited.
• An integrated  database  breeding  information  is an essential  component  
of a successful  dairy breeding  program.  The establishment  of a computerised  
database  is one of the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation ’s major  priorities.
• The technical  aspects  of cattle  breeding  will ultimately  determine  the speed  
with which  improved  genetics  contribute  to the profitability  of dairy farming  
in Ireland.  Breeding  objectives,  animal  evaluations,  progeny  testing,  semen  
technology  and embryo  technology  all make  important  contributions  to the rate 
of genetic  gain. These  issues  and the way they affect  rates of genetic  gain are 
well understood.
• Cattle  breeding  is one of many  inputs  into  milk  production.  It must  compete  
with  other  uses  of farmer ’s increasingly  scarce  money.  For this reason  Customer  
Focus  will become  an important  aspect  of the provision  of cattle breeding  
services  in Ireland.
• Dairy  farmers  are facing  on on-going  cost/price  squeeze.  The number  of 
dairy cattle is declining.  For these reasons  the efficiency  with which  cattle  
breeding  services  are provided  will play a significant  role in determining  their  
future  in Ireland.
Mission
The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  has been established  by its members  
with the mission  of: Leading  the development  of cattle  breeding  in a way 
which  will best serve  the national  commercial  livestock  sector.  Note that 
this mission  is focused  on the commercial  livestock  sector.  The commercial  
sector  are those  farmers  for whom  milk and meat production  is a business.  It 
also requires  the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  to provide  leadership  in the 
ongoing  development  of cattle breeding.
The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  is registered  as a Co-operative  and its 
membership  includes:
8 Artificial  Insemination  Societies,  13 (9 major)  Milk Recording  Societies,  
12 Cattle Breed  Societies,  Irish Farmers  Association,  Irish Creamery  Milk  
Suppliers  Association  and the Irish  Meat  Association.  These  organizations  have  
decided  to establish  the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  as a way of ensuring
41
an orderly, technologically  advanced  and efficient  progression  of cattle  breeding  
services  in Ireland.
A small headquarters  for the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  has been  
established  in Bandon  which  is operated  by South  Western  Services.  This  
decision  was made  after considering  a large number  of alternatives.  The main  
considerations  were: the need to avoid  further  overheads  on cattle breeding,  
availability  of suitable  accommodation,  availability  of support  services  and the 
avoidance  of conflicts  of interest  with the organization  providing  the 
accommodation.
Structure
The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  has an interim  Board  chaired  by Mr. 
John Malone,  the Secretary  of the Department  of Agriculture.  Two advisory  
committees  provide  the Board  with specific  advice  on matters  relating  to Beef  
Cattle  and Dairy  Cattle  breeding.  The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  will be 
utilizing  staff  and resources  from  within  its member  organizations  and employing  
outside  expertise  on a contract  basis.  In the longer  term  there  will be a requirement  
for further  Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  staff.
Funding
Funding  of the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  is initially  being  provided  
by contributions  from the member  organizations,  EU structural  funds  and by 
the Department  of Agriculture.  In the longer  term, funding  will increasingly  
be from the provision  of services  to the cattle  breeding  industry.  The challenge  
for Irish  Cattle  Breeding  Federation  and its member  organisations  is to develop  
services  which  cattle  breeders  will value and happily  pay for the full cost of 
provision.  The Department  currently  contributes  some £1 million  to cattle  
breeding  in the form of animal  evaluation,  quality  assurance  and beef  breeding  
services.  In due course  the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  will either  take 
over these  services  or establish  alternatives  which  better  meet  the needs  of the 
cattle breeding  industry.
Co-operation
The reasons  why  dairy  cattle  breeding, in contrast  to pig and poultry breeding,  
remains  a co-operative  based  industry  include:
• The value of a commercial  animal,  relative  to the cost of recording  
production  is high - of the order of 100:1 in Ireland.  This means  that it is 
comparatively  easy  to keep for commercial  cows  the records  needed  for breeding  
purposes.
• The records  required  for breeding  purposes  are also  useful for other  purposes  
such  as disease  control,  quality assurance  and subsidies.  Thus  the cost of keeping  
the records  needed  for breeding  purposes  is further  reduced.
•Artificial  insemination  provides  an inexpensive  mechanism  for distributing  
superior  genetics  to commercial  herds.  This means  that at least  within a country,  
commercial  milk producers  are able to access  the best sires at the same time 
as specialized  breeders.
42
• International  trade in animal  genetics  is well established  based  on shared  
information.  Breeders  around  the world  have access  to the best sires and to a 
slightly  less extent  dams,  in all countries  at about  the same  time. This makes  
it very difficult  for a single  organization  to gain a significant  genetic  advance  
over the co-operative  organizations.
The future  of Irish dairy  cattle  breeding  will thus be based  on co-operation  
between  farmers,  breeders,  AI organizations,  researchers,  breed associations  
both within  Ireland  and internationally.
Database
Successful  dairy  cattle  breeding  requires  access  to data on the ancestry  and 
performance  of large numbers  of cows.  A national  computerised  database  is 
the best way of providing  this information  while  avoiding  duplication  of effort,  
minimizing  errors  and facilitating  the sharing  of data  with  other  legitimate  users.  
The key database  concepts  are:
• There  is only a single  copy of the “truth ”. This means  that all changes  to 
data - new data corrections  to existing  data - are made in only one place.
• All legitimate  users  of the data  have  access  to the single  copy.  This  ensures  
that all users of the data are able to obtain  the correct  information.
Cattle  breeding  databases  with these characteristics  have been established  
in a number  of countries.  The two I_am most  familiar  with are in New  Zealand  
and Holland.  In both cases single  databases  are meeting  the needs of cattle  
breeding  while  also meeting  needs  associated  with disease  control  and quality  
assurance.  The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  is planning  to establish  such  
a database  for cattle  breeding  purposes  in Ireland.  Three  options  for establishing  
the database  are to be evaluated:
• To build one from first principles.  The main advantage  of this approach  
is that it guarantees  a database  customised  to Irish conditions.
• To purchase  an existing  database  from another  country  with similar  cattle  
breeding  requirements  to Ireland  and to modify  it to meet Irish needs.  This is 
potentially  a more rapid way of obtaining  the database.
• To contract  the provision  of database  services  to another  country  with a 
suitable  database
These  options  will be evaluated  and a decision  made on the best way to 
proceed  for Ireland.
Animal  evaluation
Animal  evaluation  systems  combine  data on ancestry  with animal  
performance  data to estimate  the genetic  merit  of individual  animals.  The Irish  
Cattle  Breeding  Federation  has decided  to give  immediate  priority  to addressing  
issues  of the time required  for the calculation  of breeding  values,  frequency  
of breeding  value calculation  and the number  of animals  evaluated.  The 
objectives  of the review  are to:
• Resolve  data  quality  issues which  cause  delays  in the calculation  of breeding  
values.
• Reduce  the time taken for the calculations  to 4 weeks  including  time for 
data to be sent to and received  from INTERBULL.
43
• Provide  evaluations  twice  per year.
• Increase  the number  of animals  for which  breeding  values  are readily  
available  above  the current  figure  of 50% of milking  cows in milk recorded  
herds.
• Implement  an improved  system  within  twelve  months.
An example  of what  can be achieved  is provided  by the new system  which  
was recently  implemented  in New Zealand.
The NZ animal  evaluation  system  comprises  two main  elements.  Every  day 
the breeding  values  are updated  for all females  with new milk  recording  results.  
Every  three  weeks  the breeding  values  for all animals  are updated.  Twice a year 
the latest INTERBULL  results  are incorporated  into the NZ evaluations.
One of the consequences  of the continual  updating  of breeding  values  is that 
it has become  possible  for newly  proven  bulls  to be used  widely on  liquid  semen  
prior to their first crop of daughters  completing  a first lactation.  There are 
substantial  genetic  implications  associated  with the shorter  generation  intervals  
thus achieved
Breeding  scheme  design  is one of the most  fruitful  aspects  of cattle  breeding  
research.  It provides  a rational  basis for making  major  decisions  on aspects  of 
cattle  breeding.  The Irish  Cattle  Breeding  Federation  will be initiating  research  
work to ensure  its breeding  decisions  have a sound  scientific  basis.
Breeding  objective
The technical  aspects  of cattle  breeding  centre  on breeding  objectives,  animal  
evaluation  and breeding  scheme  design.  Breeding  objectives  define  the goal
of cattle  breeding.  The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation,  with its focus  on the 
commercial  producers,  is considering  a review  of cattle  breeding  objectives  for 
Ireland.  The purpose  of focusing  on breeding  objectives  is that they provide  
a rational  basis for deciding  which  traits are worth  measuring  as well as the 
establishment  of criteria  to be used in selecting  bulls for use in artificial  
insemination.  An example  of the outcome  from such a review  is provided  by 
the recent  work completed  in New Zealand.
The breeding  objective  for NZ cattle  is to “maximise  the net  farm income  
per kg of dry matter".  The main  considerations  are the income  from  milk  - fat 
protein,  lactose,  water  and minerals  - income  from meat balanced  against  the 
feed requirements  for production,  replacements  and maintenance.  In this way 
a “Breeding  Worth ” has been  established  as the main selection  criteria  for NZ 
cattle  of all breeds.  A novel  aspect  of this index  is that it allows  comparisons  
across  breeds.
By including  “survival ” as a trait in the index,  account  can be taken  of any 
trait which  affects  the time an animal  lasts in the commercial  herd.
Customer  focus
Customer  focus  is a way of summarizing  an organization ’s approach  to the 
development  and provision  of services.  As cattle breeding  in Ireland  moves  
towards  industry  control  there  is a real need  to focus  on the needs  of customers  
who, in the case of dairy breeding,  are dairy farmers.
Commercial  dairy farmers  breed  cows to produce  milk that is eventually  
consumed  by a wide range of customers.  The main issue for dairy breeding  
is one of providing  farmers  with cattle  that enable  increased  efficiency  of milk  
production  and/or  improved  returns  from milk and meat sales. With genetics  
playing  such an important  role in determining  milk composition  and 
characteristic  there are opportunities  for increasing  returns  by altering  milk  
composition.  As the new genetic  technologies  develop  it is likely  that further  
opportunities  will emerge  in the future,  that is, by focusing  on the needs  of the 
customers  for milk we may be able to increase  farmer  income.
Equally  important  is the relationship  between  the Irish Cattle  Breeding  
Federation  and its members  organisations  with dairy farmers.  We must focus  
on providing  services  to farmers  which  are profitable  to the average  as well 
as the individual.  These  services  need to be valued  by farmers  to the extent  
that they are happy  to pay for them.
Some  of the implications  of a customer  focused  approach  to servicing  are:
• Services  would  be developed  to meet the needs  of farmers.
• The role of farmers  in determining  the direction  of cattle breeding  will 
increase.
• Government  will have a reducing  influence  on cattle breeding  services.
Customer  focus  is thus integral  to the working  of the Irish Cattle  Breeding
Federation.
Efficiency
There  are opportunities  for greater  efficiency  in cattle  breeding  in Ireland.  
Efficiencies  can be obtained  by:
45
• Increasing  the scale  of operation  so that fixed  overhead  costs  can be spread  
over a greater  volume  of business.  Just as larger  farms enjoy economies  of 
scale  so do cattle  breeding  organizations.  As a general  rule it is more  efficient  
to have  one organisation  than two performing  the same  functions  and covering  
the same number  of customers.  Cattle  breeding  has significant  overheads  
associated  with databases,  progeny  testing,  research  and product  development.  
With  larger  customer  bases  and greater  volumes  of business  it is easier  to carry  
these overheads.
• It is essential  that duplication  be removed.  Examples  of duplication  within  
Irish  cattle  breeding,  the removal  of which  would  result  in cost  reductions  include  
the two linear  assessment  systems  and  the databases  created  by CIMRA  (Central  
Irish Milk Recording  Authority)  and the Department  of Agriculture.
• All of the work  being  undertaken  needs  to be adding  value.  A close look  
at all costs needs  to be undertaken  to ensure  they add value.  For example,  in 
New Zealand  4 or 5 tests per lactation  is considered  adequate  for breeding  
purposes.  What  value is added  by the extra 4 or 5 tests per herd in Ireland?
• The rapid  developments  in information  technology  provide  opportunities  
to use automation  to reduce  costs. Equally  there are developments  in semen  
technology  which  enable  greater  use of high index bulls.
A focus  on efficiency  is one of the priorities  for Irish cattle  breeding  in the 
future.  Here are a couple  of illustrations  of the extent  to which  New Zealand  
was successful  in achieving  increased  efficiency.
The first example  comes  from  artificial  insemination.  This  comparison  shows
Comparative  Costs  of Artificial  
Insemination

B Price of Semen
46
the average  cost to farmers  of artificial  insemination  per pregnancy  in several  
countries  including  Ireland.
The results  are expressed  in Irish £ and are based  on figures  collected  over  
the last two years. While  herd  size can explain  some  of the difference,  economies  
of scale,  removal  of duplication  and use of appropriate  technology  also  explains  
a large part.

300 1.68 1.79 1.89 2.00 2.11
350 1.60 1.69 1.78 1.87 1.96
The second  example  comes  from Milk Recording.  Table 1 shows  in Irish  
£ (converted  at £0.40  to $NZ 1.00) the current  charges  for milk recording  on 
the most commonly  used system  in NZ. The highlighted  row is the average  
herd size in New Zealand.  Note that charges  per cow per year vary according  
to herd size and number  ot tests. The average  paid per farmer  is much  lower  
than  in Ireland.  The herds  are larger,  the system  utilizes  farmer  labour  for sample  
collection  and a wide range of options  are available.
The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  is initiating  a project  to find less 
expensive  milk  recording  options  for Ireland.  The project  will focus  on reducing  
the costs associated  with determining  milk volume  and sample  collection.  If 
a less expensive  system  can be found  and demonstrated  to be practical  you can 
expect  to see it introduced  in Ireland  in the future.
In conclusion:
The Irish Cattle  breeding  industry  has committed  itself to a process  of 
improvement  with some of the immediate  goals being to:
• Increase  the collaboration  between  organisations.
• Implement  a cattle breeding  database  which  will be shared  by the cattle  
breeding  organisations.
• Improvements  to the animal  evaluation  systems.
• An increased  customer  focus.
• Greater  efficiency.

Genetic  Selection  for Higher  Milk  
Yield: Opportunities  to Use Energy  
Balance,  Feed Intake  and Liveweight*.

Introduction
Most  dairy cattle  breeding  schemes  world-wide  have had a dramatic  effect  
on the productivity  of cows  in many  countries  in the last few decades.  However,  
there  has always  been concern  about  the suitability  of these  breeding  schemes  
to produce  cows that perform  on a grass-based  diet. To date, however,  there  
is convincing  evidence  (from  experimental  herds,  e.g. Langhill  and Moorepark,  
and from larger  population  studies  e.g. Cromie  et al. 1997)  that high genetic  
merit  animals  outperform  their low genetic  merit  counterparts  in most  feeding  
systems,  at least  in terms  of production.  More  of a problem  for grass  orientated  
systems  is that high genetic  merit animals  have, on average,  poorer  fertility  
across  feeding  systems  (Figure  1). The question  of whether  these effects  on 
fertility  are exacerbated  on grass based  systems  or low concentrate  systems  is 
yet unanswered.  The challenge  is clearly  to select  high producing  animals  that 
maintain  their  fertility  in all feeding  systems.  That  enough  of these  animals  are 
around  is shown  in Figure  1, and hence  there is scope  for genetic  selection  to 
improve  both fertility  and yield.
The potential  role that energy  balance  might  play hereby, are currently  under  
investigation  at ID-DLO  in Lelystad.  The aim of this paper  is to outline  some

recent  information  on the heritability  of energy  balance  and how it interacts  
with selection  for milk production,  feed intake  and liveweight.
Heritability
That the amount  of food eaten by a cow, bodyweight,  energy  balance  and 
condition  score  are not only affected  by the feeding  systems  but are heritable  
also, is less well understood.  Heritability  estimates  from our data in Lelystad  
demonstrate  this again (Table  1). Heritabilities  for all traits are close to 0.5, 
which  means  that about  50% of differences  between  cows can be explained  
by their genetic  background.  Hence,  using  genetic  selection  alone,  cows can 
become  heavier  or lighter  or, more  importantly,  cows  can be selected  to have  
a more or less negative  energy  balance  during  early lactation.
Table 1
Heritability  for milk yield,  liveweight,  dry matter  intake  and energy  balance,  
and heritable  association  (i.e. genetic  correlation)  between  these traits.
Genetic  correlations
Heritability Milk production Liveweight DM1
Milk production 0.48
Liveweight 0.54 0.31
Dry matter  intake 0.62 0.48 0.75
Energy  balance 0.51 -0.46 0.29 0.55
(‘t Gen experimental  farm, Oldenbroek  et al. 1997)
Genetic  associations  between  traits
Also important  are the genetic  correlations  between  traits,  which  can range  
from  -1 to +1. This  is because  the correlations  indicate  the association  between  
traits and how they respond  together  to genetic  selection.  For example,  from  
Table  1 it can be seen that selection  for milk  production  alone  results  in a higher  
dry matter  intake  (because  the correlation  is 0.48)  and a more  negative  energy  
balance  because  the correlation  is -0.46.
Another  important  conclusion  that can be drawn  is that selection  on anyone  
of the traits  in Table  1 will affect  changes  in almost  all of the other  traits  (because  
all correlations  are different  from  0). This makes  genetic  selection  to improve  
feed efficiency  more  complex.  This is because  what  might  be perceived  to be 
gained  by accounting  for one of the traits, might  in fact be lost because  the 
others  are changed  in a negative  way. A clear example  is that selection  for a 
lighter  cow might  give a perceived  advantage  (because  the lower  maintenance  
costs associated  with smaller  cows),  but selection  for a lower  liveweight  will 
result  in a more negative  energy  balance  also (Table  1).
Energy  balance
In Table 1 it can be seen that selection  for a higher  milk yield results  in a 
more  negative  energy  balance  also (correlation  -0.46).  Or, on a given  diet, high

(‘t Gen experimental  farm, Oldenbroek  el al. 1997)
genetic  merit  cows  are more  willing  to go in a negative  energy balance  to produce  
milk.  This is not surprising:  the energy  for extra  milk production  has to come  
from  either  eating  more  food  or mobilising  more  body  tissue.  The cow that eats 
most and is still prepared  to be in the most negative  energy  balance  will be 
most productive  in terms of yield.
’T Gen results
The heritability  and the genetic  association  between  traits  have  been  discussed  
above.  The effects  of these genetic  associations  are demonstrated  in Table  2. 
In Table  2 three groups  of animals  have been created:  high, medium  and low 
genetic  merit.  As expected,  milk  yield  increases  with increasing  genetic  merit.  
More  interesting  is the observation  for liveweight.  At calving,  high  genetic  merit  
heifers  are 47 kg heavier  compared  with  the low genetic  merit  animals. However,  
at 100 days in milk  this difference  is reduced  to 13 and 19 kg respectively.  This  
is because  the high genetic  merit  animals  lose weight,  whereas  the others  gain 
weight  in this period.

The production  in terms  of energy  and the calculated  mean  energy  balance  
for the three  groups  is given  in Table  3. The pattern  is as predicted  above:  high  
genetic  merit  cows have a more negative  energy  balance  when fed the same  
diet (unlimited  intake))  as lower  genetic  merit  counterparts.  The  blood  parameters  
also indicate  that high genetic  merit animals  are in a more negative  energy  
balance.
Importance  of energy  balance
The importance  of energy  balance  is demonstrated  in Figure  2; the relationship  
between  energy  balance  and days  till first  heat  is negative.  These  results  support  
other  evidence  that cows  that are in a more  negative  energy  balance  take longer  
to come  in heat. This has obvious  consequences  when  maintaining  a 365-day  
calving  interval  and is economically  important  on grass based  systems.

Conclusions
High genetic  merit  cows have a higher  production  because  they consume  
more  food  and they lose more  body  tissue  during  lactation.  The high  heritability  
for energy  balance  provides  an excellent  opportunity  to improve  energy  balance  
by genetic  selection.  Genetic  improvement  of the energy  balance  might  be a 
good  method  to select  animals  that have a high yield and a good fertility.  The 
best  method  hereto  is under  investigation  currently.  Easier  fertility  management,  
together  with a high milk yield  might  be the benefit.  This might  be particular  
relevant  in grass based feeding  systems,  where  there is less scope to use 
concentrates  to compensate  for a negative  energy  balance  and where  it is 
important  to maintain  a 365 day calving  interval.

Prediction  of Animal  Performance  
from Silage  Analyses

Co. Down.
For many  years  dairy  cows  in Ireland  have  been  managed  using  a ‘blueprint ’ 
approach  for a particular  system.  In such  methods  we think  of the average  cow,  
under  average  grazing  conditions,  with average  sward  quality  and we design  
management  systems  around  this. We must recognise  that the use of such  
systems,  supported  by well-targeted  research,  has moved  the industry  to its 
present  very competitive  position.  While  this ‘blueprint ’ approach  has served  
us well in the past it has a number  of shortfalls  in relation  to how we should  
feed and manage  cows  in the next 10 - 15 years.  Up to the  present  the penalties  
have not been great  if the feeding  and management  of the cows has not been  
correct,  but all this is changing  very rapidly  due to changes  in performance  
potential  of our dairy cows.
The rate of genetic  improvement  in the dairy herd in the United  Kingdom  
and the Republic  of Ireland  to 1985 was relatively  slow, approximately  0 to 
0.5% per year. More  recently,  however,  there has been a marked  increase  in 
the rate of genetic  improvement,  with Lindberg  et al. (1998)  reporting  the rate 
of genetic  gain in milk  fat plus protein  yield  as 2.2%  per year,  during  the period  
1990-1994.  The main  effect  of increasing  genetic  merit  is that a greater  proportion  
of food energy  is partitioned  to milk production,  with less energy  partitioned  
towards  body reserves  i.e. to body condition.  For example,  research  at 
Hillsborough  indicates  that high merit cows (RBI95  138 approx.)  produced  
12.8%  more  milk and yet only consumed  6% extra  dry matter  compared  to low 
merit  cows  (RBI^,  100 approx.).  This  major  increase  in yield  with  only marginal  
increases  in intake  means  that efficiency  of conversion  of feed into milk  
(energetic  efficiency)  is greater  with high merit  cows.  However,  more  detailed  
studies  showed  that there were no differences  in the partial  efficiency  of use 
of energy  for milk production  between  high and low merit  cows.  The net result  
was that the high merit  cows  lost weight  through  lactation  while  the low merit  
cows  gained  weight.  The long-term  production,  health  and welfare  implications  
associated  with  this loss of body  condition  obviously  presents  a major  challenge  
in dairying  systems.  This  could  be particularly  important  in systems  with a high 
reliance  on either  grazed  or conserved  grass.
In this era of increasing  genetic  merit of dairy cows and a wide range in 
the genetic  merits  of cows on individual  farms  there is an urgent  need to re­
examine  our approaches  to feeding  the dairy cow.  The future  key must  be getting  
greater  precision  into feeding.  We must  ensure  that our feed rationing  systems  
are appropriate  for the high levels  of performance  that can now be achieved  
if we are to ensure  that our cows  survive  and produce  for long  productive  lives
52
in our herds.  Research  must  provide  the manager  with  sound  and reliable  decision  
support  systems  which  will aid the complex  decision  making  processes  which  
are involved  in managing  these  high merit  cows.  While  in the past considerable  
effort  has been expended  in relation  to feeding  cows to meet the short term  
economics  of our systems,  there  is no doubt  that in the long term we must  also 
embrace  the biological  needs of our animals  to produce,  remain  healthy  and 
achieve  appropriate  reproductive  targets.
In order to develop  these aspects  this paper  will briefly  review:
(a) current  information  on the feed (energy)  requirements  of dairy  cows  with  
particular  reference  to recent  research  at Agricultural  Research  Institute  of 
Northern  Ireland  and
(b) the recent  programme  which  has enabled  near infrared  reflectance  
spectroscopy  (NIRS)  to become  a powerful  tool in feed characterisation.
The paper  will also outline  how these two components  have been brought  
together  to enable  the Hillsborough  Feeding  Information  System  and associated  
beef and dairy cattle  rationing  programs  to be developed.
Background  to energy  nutrition  of dairy  cows
Within the United  Kingdom  the amount  of dietary  energy required  to support  
the maintenance  and productive  demands  of ruminant  livestock  is estimated  
in terms of metabolizable  energy  (ME) with diets being  formulated  to meet  
these  requirements  according  to the ME content  of the individual  components.  
The ME rather  than Net Energy  system  is therefore  the baseline  for this paper.

Figure  1 - Schematic  representation  of dietary  ME use in the dairy  cow.
53
Feed  energy  use by the dairy  cow is represented  schematically  in Figure  1. 
Cows require  energy  for maintenance,  milk production,  liveweight  gain and 
pregnancy.  In our present  feeding  approaches,  these are estimated  separately  
and then added  together  to give an estimate  of the cow ’s total energy  
requirements.  While  there  is considerable  debate  about  the simplistic  approach  
of attributing  energy  requirements  into these specific  compartments  in reality  
there is no other useful  approach  to formulating  diets. The key components  
which  are therefore  necessary  in ration formulation  are the maintenance  
requirement  (ME^)  and the efficiencies  with which  the remaining  energy  is 
converted  to milk energy  (k.) or body gain (k^).
Estimating  energy  requirements
The estimates  of maintenance  energy  requirement  and the efficiencies  of 
ME use for milk production  and liveweight  gain used in today ’s ME feed 
rationing  systems  (AFRC,  1990 and 1993) were based on classical  energy  
metabolism  studies  undertaken  30-50  years ago using very different  animals  
and diets  to those  in use today.  However,  there  is an increasing  body  of evidence  
to suggest  that total energy  requirements  calculated  by using  this route  are not 
relevant  to many of the situations  which  presently  exist.
Over  a large number  of studies  (calorimetry  and feeding  studies)  when  we 
have fed animals  according  to what in theory  they required,  they have been  
on average  losing  weight  at a rate of 0.35 kg/d (Agnew  et al, 1998). It could  
be argued  that the situation  could  be remedied  in current  feeding  standards  by 
increasing  these feeding  standards  (AFRC,  1990)  by around  5%, as in AFRC  
(1993).  This approach  is extremely  simplistic  and it does not identify  which  
component  of requirements  is in error. It rather  assumes  that all components  
are equally  in error. Diets must now be formulated  for cows across  an ever 
increasing  range  of milk outputs  and where  the error lies has therefore  major  
implications  for how we feed animals  at opposing  ends of the production  scale.  
For these  reasons  it is important  that we develop  a more  accurate  approach  to 
feeding  cows and this has been part of our ongoing  research  programme  at 
Hillsborough.
Current  standards  suggest  that a 600 kg dairy  cow  requires  58 MJ/d  of energy  
to maintain  her body functions  (i.e. maintenance).  Research  at Hillsborough  
suggests  that the dairy cows of today require  75 MJ/d for maintenance  (Yan 
et al, 1997 and 1998),  a figure  which  is approximately  30% higher  than that 
widely  used across  the industry  at present.  In addition,  during  the last number  
of years,  many  researchers  have  suggested  that forage  based  diets  are used less 
efficiently  for milk  production  than the feeding  standards  suggest.  Our research  
indicates  that the feeding  standards  are correct  and energy  is used for milk  
production  with an efficiency  of 0.65 (or 65%).  It is therefore  important  when  
calculating  requirements  of dairy  cattle  that we recognise  these  recent  findings  
and incorporate  them into our approaches  to feeding.
How do cows respond  to extra  feed?
We have  discussed  developing  feeding  standards  which  will enable  the most  
accurate  rationing  of dairy cows. However,  such approaches  are of limited
54
practical  value  in the real world  in which  we must  be able to predict  optimum  
feeding  levels and strategies  for animals  of differing  milk yield potential,  
producing  in a range  of physical  and economic  environments. In this latter  context  
the key factor  is how the animal  responds  to additional  feed. This is primarily  
driven  by how the animal  partitions  that additional  feed between  milk output  
and liveweight  gain.  Only  when  we fully  understand  this partitioning  relationship,  
and how it is influenced  by both animal  and feed factors,  can sensible  feeding  
approaches  be developed.  The question  for researchers  is therefore  to quantify  
those animal  and feed factors  which  influence  partitioning  relationships  and 
to build  these  into a feeding  system  along  with  any new  estimates  of requirements  
which  may come along.
In conclusion,  recent  research  at Hillsborough  has demonstrated  that we 
currently  underfeed  dairy  cows  and the energy  required  to maintain  a dairy  cow 
is some  30% higher  than that in published  feeding  standards.  Having  reviewed  
the animals  requirements  and indicated  how  we consider  these  to be very  different  
to that normally  accepted,  we must  now  turn to examine  methods  to characterise  
feeds.
Characterisation  of grass silage
Grass  silage  is the main  component  of winter  diets for ruminants  and more  
accurate  rationing  can only be acjiieved  if methods  are available  for;
(a) predicting  the feeding  value  and intake  potential  of the silages  which  form  
the basis of the winter  diet, and
(b) enabling  the most  appropriate  level  and type of supplement  to be matched  
to the silage  to achieve  pre-set  animal  performance  targets.
Silage  feeding  value  depends  on (a) the nutritive  value  of 1 kg silage  (ME  
concentration)  and (b) the quantity  of silage  the animal  will consume  (intake  
potential).  It must be especially  recognised  however  that the latter is more  
important  than the former  in determining  the feeding  value of a silage.  For 
example,  within  the major  Hillsborough  study  using 136 silages,  ME content  
ranged  from 9.8 to 13.5 MJ/kg  DM (ratio 1:1.4)  while  intake  ranged  from 4.3 
to 10.9 kg/day  (ratio 1:2.5)  (Steen  et al., 1998).  Accurate  prediction  of both  
intake  and ME  concentration  (digestibility)  of a silage  are both  therefore  essential  
pre-requisites  to the effective  rationing  of dairy cows and beef cattle  offered  
grass silage  ad libitum.
The Hillsborough  Silage  Evaluation  System
While  numerous  other researchers  have attempted  to develop  methods  of 
predicting  silage  intake  from a range  of chemical  parameters  these  have been  
totally  ineffective.  At the onset  of the Hillsborough  programme  it was recognised  
that a system  could  only be developed  if the intake,  digestibility  etc. of a large  
number  of silages,  representing  the range  of types  of silages  across  the industry,  
were characterised  within  a standard  animal  protocol.  As a result,  the study  
involved  selecting  silages  on the basis of their pH, dry matter,  ammonia  and 
metabolizable  energy  contents.  A total of 136 silages  were  selected  on this basis  
from farms  across  Northern  Ireland.  Approximately  seven  tonnes  of each  silage
55
were brought  to the Institute,  mixed  in a mixer  wagon  to achieve  uniformity  
and then stored  in polythene-lined  boxes  until feeding  one to four weeks  later.  
There was no deterioration  of the silages  during  storage  and their chemical  
composition  remained  constant  (Pippard  etal., 1995).  The silages  were  offered  
to 192 individually  fed steers,  which  were  crosses  of the continental  beef  breeds  
and had a mean  initial  live weight  of 415 kg, in a partially-balanced  changeover  
design  experiment  to measure  ad libitum  intake.  Each  silage  was offered  as the 
sole feed to ten animals  for a period  of two weeks.  Eight  silages  were  offered  
in each of 17 periods  and in addition  a further  16 animals  in each period  were  
offered  a standard  hay to enable  variation  in intake  between  different  periods  
to be removed.  Detailed  chemical  and biological  compositions  of the silages  
were determined  including  the use of near infrared  reflectance  spectroscopy  
and electrometric  titration.  All silages  were offered  to sheep  to determine  in 
vivo digestibility.  The rates of disappearance  and rumen  degradabilities  of the 
dry matter,  nitrogen  and fibre fractions  in the 136 silages  were determined  in 
vivo using the in sacco  method.
Thirteen  of the 136 silages  were  also offered  unsupplemented  to dairy  cows  
to provide  a basis  by which  the intake  system  developed  from  the data  produced  
with beef  cattle  could  be translated  for use with  dairy  cows.  In addition,  sixteen  
of the silages  were  offered  to dairy  cows  and growing  beef  cattle  with a range  
of concentrate  types  and levels.  Each  silage  was supplemented  with  high-starch  
and high-fibre  concentrates,  each  with  three  protein  contents  and at three  levels  
of supplementation.  This process  enabled  the examination  of the interactions  
between  silage  type and concentrate  type/level  of supplementation  in terms  of 
their effects  on silage  intake.
Data have been used to develop  relationships  between  individual  chemical  
parameters  of the silages,  or groups  of parameters,  and intake  using  simple  and 
multiple  regression  analyses.  These  have been reported  by Steen and Agnew  
(1996)  and Steen et al. (1998).  Samples  of undried  silages,  and after drying  
for 20 h at 85°C,  were  also scanned  through  a near infrared  spectrophotometer.
Prediction  of intake
Chemical  parameters  (and their combinations)  were of limited  value in 
predicting  the intake  potential  of a silage.  These  relationships  produced  low 
correlation  coefficients.  Near  infrared  reflectance  spectroscopy  was first shown  
to be a rapid method  for predicting  the chemical  composition  of forages  by 
Norris  et al. (1976).  Since then numerous  workers  have explored  the use of 
NIRS  for the prediction  of both  chemical  composition  and digestibility  of grass  
silages.  Attempts  have also been made  to use NIRS to predict  the voluntary  
intake  potential  of forages.  In the present  study  the potential  of NIRS  to predict  
intake  and digestibility  through  scanning  both dried  and undried  samples  was 
explored.  The results  of these  have  been  reported  in detail  by Park  etal. (1997)  
and Gordon  et al. (1998).  This technique  proved  to be by far the best method  
with R^ of 0.89 and 0.94 for intake  and organic  matter  digestibility,  based  on 
dried  silages,  respectively. Calibrations  based  on NIR  spectra  of undried  samples  
of grass silage,  which  had been chopped,  produced  predictions  of intake  and
56
digestibility  with accuracies  similar  to those  achieved  using  NIRS  with dried  
samples.  Table 1 demonstrates  the improvement  in prediction  of OMD  with  
NIRS over other  commonly  used methods.

Subsequent  research  has also produced  accurate  predictive  equations  for a 
wide  range  of chemical  and biological  parameters  of undried  (wet)  silages  which  
are important  in nutritional  terms  to the animal.  This work  is reported  in detail  
by Park et al. (1998).  Examples  are given in Table 2.

This  research  programme  has developed  a rapid,  cheap  and effective  method  
for predicting  a wide  range  of chemical  and biological  parameters  of grass  silage  
for use in dairy  cow, beef  cattle  and sheep  rationing  systems.  This  research  has 
been  widely  recognised  as leading,  world  class  research  and the system  produced,  
based  on near infrared  reflectance  spectroscopy  (NIRS),  is widely  recognised  
to be the best system  currently  available.  These  new methods,  while  not yet 
currently  commercially  available  elsewhere  in the UK or Ireland,  enable  cost 
effective  and accurate  predictions  of a range  of nutritionally important  parameters  
of grass silage.
Development  of nutritional  models
Combining  new information  on feed (energy)  requirements  of both dairy  
and beef cattle,  and an effective  method  of predicting  nutritionally  important  
characteristics  of silage,  led to the development  of the Hillsborough  Feeding  
Information  System,  and an associated  new  beef  cattle  rationing  program.  Work  
is ongoing  on tbe development  of a dairy cow rationing  program.
57
The Hillsborough  Feeding  Information  System  is commercially  available  
to the agricultural  industry  throughout  Ireland.  It uses the latest analytical  
technology  to evaluate  silages  and couples  this to a series  of computer  programs  
to provide  feeding  advice  for dairy cows,  beef  cattle  and sheep.  Commercial  
silage  samples  are accurately  evaluated  in 15 minutes.  The Beef  Cattle  Rationing  
Program,  developed  jointly  between  Agricultural  Research  Institute  of Northern  
Ireland,  Department  of Agriculture  for Northern  Ireland  and Meat  and Livestock  
Commission  is commercially  available  throughout  the UK and Ireland.
Conclusions
Accurate  rationing  of ruminant  animals  depends  upon accurately  knowing  
the animals ’ nutrient  requirements  for differing  functions  and having  effective  
laboratory  methods  for predicting  the characteristics  of forages.  Research  has 
demonstrated  that the present  estimates  adopted  for maintenance  in cattle  are 
well below  those necessary  for animals  on forage  based  diets. These  new 
estimates  for maintenance  coupled  with the results  of a large scale study to 
develop  improved  methods  of predicting  intake  and digestibility  of grass  silage  
have  enabled  much  more  accurate  feed rationing  programmes  to be developed.  
These  developments,  which  will be further  refined  over  time,  represent  a major  
step forward  in accurately  rationing  ruminant  livestock.

New Energy  and Protein  Systems  for 
Ruminants
F. P. O’MARA  
University  College  Dublin.
Energy  is the most important  nutrient  for animals,  followed  by protein.  
Animals  must  be properly  fed with energy  and protein  in order  to achieve  the 
desired  performance.  To assist  in this, systems  have  been  developed  for protein  
and energy  feeding.  These  all allow  the dietary  supply  of energy/protein  and 
the animal  requirements  of energy/protein  to be assessed  and matched.  Some  
recent  developments  in energy  and protein  systems  for ruminants  are outlined  
in this paper.
Historical  perspective  and current  situation  in Ireland  and 
internationally
For ruminants,  the early energy  systems  such as those  devised  by Kellner  
(1905)  in Europe  and Armsby  (1917)  in the USA were based  on net energy.  
In 1962, a system  based  on metabolisable  energy  was proposed  in the UK by 
Blaxter  (1962).  To my knowledge,  Ireland,  Switzerland,  and Finland  are the 
only European  countries  to have  adopted  the ME approach.  The major  livestock  
producing  countries  of France,  Germany  and the Netherlands  all opted  to keep  
the net energy  approach  and have developed  modern  net energy  systems.  The 
ME system  can be criticised  on theoretical  and practical  grounds.  Some  Irish  
scientists,  most  notably  my colleagues  in University  College  Dublin  have  voiced  
their criticisms  (e.g. Caffrey,  1993).  I joined  UCD in 1993 to work on these  
energy  systems  under  the sponsorship  of the Irish Grain  & Feed  Association.  
I reached  the same conclusion  that net energy  would  be a better  basis of feed 
evaluation  than ME. That  project  culminated  in the publication  of a net energy  
system  (O’Mara,  1996)  which  was modelled  on the French  net energy  system.  
Using  Irish data (mainly  Teagasc),  a set of net energy  values  as specific  as 
possible  to Irish feeds  was generated  and adjustments  were  made  to the animal  
requirements  for growth  and fattening  to bring them into line with the levels  
of performance  obtained  here  in Ireland. In this paper  I outline  the considerations,  
theoretical  and practical,  that  justify  the use of NE instead  of ME and to outline  
the system  we have devised.
On the protein  side, crude  protein  has long been recognised  as inadequate  
for ruminants.  Terms  like undegradable  protein  (UDP)  and rumen  degradable  
protein  (RDP)  for many years were attempts  to better  describe  feed protein.  
More  comprehensive  systems  have  been  developed  in France  (the PDI system)  
and the UK (the MP system). Recently  the Dutch  evaluated  which  of the existing  
systems  could  best be used under  Dutch  conditions  (Van Straalen  et al., 1993)  
and concluded  that the French  PDI system  was the most  accurate  in predicting  
milk protein  production.  I will illustrate  later how the PDI system  would  rate 
our typical  grass silage  based  diets.

What  is metabolisable  energy  and net energy?
Of the energy  which  the animal  digests  (i.e., after losses  in faeces  are 
deducted),  some is lost as methane  and some is excreted  in the urine. The 
remaining  energy  is called  the metabolisable  energy  (ME).  It is an abstract  term  
and cannot  be measured  directly  - it is measured  indirectly  by measuring  losses  
in faeces,  methane  and urine,  and deducting  these from total or gross  energy.  
The metabolisable  energy  is available  to the animal  for maintenance  and animal  
products  such as milk, meat  and wool,  but it is not used with 100%  efficiency  
- some is lost as heat:
ME X k = NE
where  k is an efficiency  factor  which  is very poorly  understood.  So net energy  
(NE)  is the energy  used to maintain  the animal  or which  is recovered  in animal  
product.  It can be measured  indirectly  by measuring  heat loss (very difficult)  
and subtracting  this from  ME or measured  directly  by measuring  animal  product  
and measuring  or in most cases,  estimating  maintenance  requirements.  This  
allows  net energy  values  to be derived  from or tested  and validated  by animal  
production  studies.
The advantages  of a net energy  system
The main advantage  of a NE system  is that the feed values  are inherently  
more realistic  as guides  to the usefulness  of the feeds than ME values.  This  
can be explained  as follows:
• As stated  above, NE values  can be derived  from  or can be tested  and validated  
by animal  production  studies  which  have  been  carried  out in Ireland.  Values  
so derived  must  be more  meaningful  than ME values  measured  in sheep  fed 
at maintenance  which  the ME system  uses.
• NE ranks feeds on the basis of animal  performance  and thus allows  
comparisons  of the productive  value of different  feeds but ME values  are 
not necessarily  related  to animal  maintenance  or production.  For instance,  
it takes about 12 MJ of ME from good quality  forage  and 14 MJ of ME 
from  poor  quality  forage  to equal  the 11 MJ of ME in 1 kg of barley  in terms  
of value  for animal  production.  In other  words,  the usefulness  of ME depends  
on where  it comes  from. Obviously  ME should  not to used to compare  the 
energy  value of concentrates  and forages.
• ME values  as they have evolved  have no intrinsic  value over DE values  
because,  (a) they are generally  measured  at maintenance  feeding  level  where  
there is a very close  relationship  between  DE and ME, (b) methane  energy  
is usually  predicted  in measurements  of ME, (c) the relationship  between  
ME at maintenance  and ME at production  level is variable,  depending  
on both the physiological  state  of the animal  and the feed,  and (d) no attempt  
is made  to segregate  urine into animal  derived  and food derived  products.
• While  NE systems  may predict  NE from DE or ME values,  the NE values  
so derived  can be adjusted  to reconcile  them with measured  animal  
performance  if necessary.  This is a vital element  of the Irish net 
energy  system.  An ME based  system  of feed evaluation  has no such ‘safety  
mechanism ’.

Net energy  for Ireland?
In UCD  we have  taken  the view  that we should  be using  an NE based  system  
instead  of an ME based  system  for feed evaluation  in Ireland.  This view is not 
taken likely considering  the close links we have with the UK and Northern  
Ireland.  However,  we believe  that the points  above  are compelling  reasons  for 
change  - if NE is a better  basis for feed evaluation,  we should  be using it 
regardless  of the difficulty  of unlearning  the ME system  and learning  a new 
system  with new terminology,  values,  etc. Our own system  gives us the 
independence  to put our values  on feeds  in an organised  and structured  manner.  
Teagasc  and UCD  have carried  out (and continue  to do so) a huge amount  of 
feed evaluation  work.  What  is the point  of all that if the results  are not used?  
The easiest  way to harness  the information  generated  is in a net energy  system  
of our own. As new information  on feeds  becomes  available  from home  and 
abroad,  this can be incorporated  by updating  the feed values.  The silage  intake  
values  predicted  by the Hillsborough  NIR calibration  are well suited  to 
incorporation  into the French  intake  system  (which  won ’t be dealt  with in this 
paper).  The net energy  system  can easily  accommodate  any developments  in 
the ME approach  since  the fundamental  objective  in all systems  is that the value  
attributable  to a feed can be used to accurately  predict  the value  of that feed 
to the animal.
Outline  of the recently  proposed  Irish net energy  system
The NE systems  developed  for use in Ireland  are mainly  based  on the French  
NE systems  (Jarrige,  1989).  The French  systems  have been chosen  for many  
reasons
• They  are very  comprehensive  and are backed  up by a huge  amount  of animal  
experimentation.
• Systems  of production  and animal  types in France  are reasonably  similar  
to those in Ireland.
• Their  feed  database  includes information  on several  hundred  feedstuffs,  based  
on thousands  of in vivo measurements.
• The net energy  values  are all expressed  relative  to barley  as a standard  feed 
which  makes  the values  more  meaningful  to farmers  than  abstract  megajoules.
• The French  also have well developed  protein  and intake  systems  (the PDI 
and Fill Unit systems,  respectively)  which  have been combined  with their  
energy  systems  and feed database  in a computer  operated  diet formulation  
package  (INRAtion)  which  is available  in English.  Together,  these  systems  
provide  an excellent  “conceptual  framework ” for designing  feeding  programs.  
The Irish net energy  systems  differ  from the French  systems  mainly  in the
nutrient  values  of the feedstuffs.  The nutrient  values  are based  as much  as possible  
on Irish data. This ranges  from data on the chemical  composition  of the feeds,  
measurements  of their in vivo digestibility,  and measurement  of animal  
performance  in comparative  feeding  trials.  Thus,  the feed tables  are related  to 
the feeds used in Ireland  and the use of feeding  experiments  in deriving  the 
net energy  values  is important  in ensuring  that they are the best available  values.
62
The aim has been to provide  values  that reflect  animal  performance  as closely  
as possible  and thus, to give accurate  feed evaluation.
Expressing  energy  value  as feed units
The NE systems  for dairy and beef  cattle  and sheep  assign  two NE values  
to the feedstuffs,  one for maintenance  and lactation  in dairy cattle  and sheep,  
and one for maintenance  and weight  gain in fattening  animals.  The energy  
requirements  of animals  are expressed  in the same  units.  The values  proposed  
for use in Ireland  are followed  by (I) to distinguish  them from corresponding  
French  values.  The NE of a feed for maintenance  and lactation  are expressed  
in the same units called  UFL (Unite  Fourragere  Lait - Feed Unit for Milk)  in 
the French  system  and UFL(I)  in the Irish Republic.  UFL(I)  values  for some  
feedstuffs  are given in Table 1.
One UFL(I)  is the NE content  of 1 kg of 
for milk productionair dry standard  barley
Table 1

Sunflower  meal, CF > 30% 0.59
Rapeseed  meal 0.88
Grass silage,  70 DMD 0.79 (DM basis)
Spring  grass 0.95 (DM basis)
For intensive  beef  production,  tbe overall  NE value  for meat  production  of 
the feedstuffs  at an animal  production  level (APL)  of 1.5 times  maintenance
is used.  This is expressed  in units  called  UFV  (Unite  Fourragere  Viande  - Feed  
Unit for Meat)  in the French  system  and UFV(I)  in the Irish Republic.
One UFV  is the NE content  of 1 kg of air dry standard  barley
for meat  production  at an APL of 1.5
An APL of 1.5 corresponds  approximately  to a daily weight  gain of 1 kg/ 
day in finishing  steers.
Net energy  requirements  are expressed  in the same  units,  UFL(I)  and UFV(I),  
as feedstuff  NE content,  and are treated  as being additive.  Requirements  
expressed  in UFL(I)  are;
63
• the requirements  of dairy  cows  (or sheep)  during  lactation,  pregnancy  or the 
dry period,
• the requirements  of dairy heifers  (or ewe lambs),  wintering  and slowly  
growing  animals  (i.e., liveweight  gain between  0 and 1.0 kg/d for growing  
cattle),
• breeding  males.
Requirements  expressed  in UFV(I)  are:
• the requirements  of rapidly  growing  and fattening  animals  (steers,  bulls,  beef  
heifers  and fattening  lambs).
Standard  barley
Barley  is used as the reference  feedstuff  in the French  NE system  and in 
this system.  It is defined  by Jarrige  (1989)  as being  the average  composition  
of barley  samples  analysed  in France  between  1977  and 1987:  87.0%  dry matter  
(DM),  4.36%  crude  fibre  (CF), 10.5%  crude  protein  (CP), 1.93%  ether  extract  
(EE), organic  matter  digestibility  (OMD)  = 0.86 and energy  digestibility  = 
0.837.  The OMD  is very similar  to the average  of samples  (n = 8) analysed  
in UCD  from 1994  to 1996.  The OMD  of the Irish samples  was slightly  lower  
(0.849)  but the DE content  of the eight  samples  (15.6 MJ/kg  DM) is exactly  
the same  as the French  value.  Because  the reference  feeds in both systems  are 
so similar,  UFL  and UFV  values  from  the French  system  can be used for feeds  
where  no specific  Irish values  are available.
Why do we need a set of Irish feed values?
The  French  have  carried  out thousands  of in vivo  measurements  on feedstuffs  
in developing  their  comprehensive  database.  So have  the Dutch  and the British.  
Are we re-inventing  the wheel  or being  nationalistic  by setting  out to have  our 
own values?  The answer  is no because  feeds  can differ  depending  on the region  
in which  they are produced.  This is easiest  to visualise  with forages  where  
varieties  and climatic  conditions  will combine  to produce  material  of different

quality in different  countries.  However,  with  concentrate  feeds which  are largely  
imported  except  for home  produced  cereals,  the quality  of material  imported  
into Ireland  could  differ  markedly  from  that imported  by some  of our neighbours.  
This is illustrated  in Table  2 which  shows  the organic  matter  digestibility  of 
various  feedstuffs  as given in the Irish, UK and French  databases.  The Irish  
data are measurements  of digestibility  carried  out at UCD over the past four 
years.  The methodology  used in all three countries  was similar.
The data show similar  results  for many feeds such as barley,  wheat,  beet 
pulp, citrus  pulp, and soyabean  meal but they also show  substantial  variation  
in the quality  of other  feedstuffs  between  countries.  Both the UK and France  
report  much  higher  digestibility  for corn gluten  than we have  measured  at UCD.  
The French  values  for palm kernel  and rapeseed  meal are much higher  than 
our measurements  and the UK value for pollard  (wheat  middlings)  is much  
higher  than our measurements.  These  differences  may reflect  differences  in the 
grades  of materials  imported  by each country  or they may be due to changes  
in the quality  of the by-product  over  time  as the manufacturing  processes  become  
more efficient.  This reduced  quality  would  be picked  up in the Irish values  
because  these  have all been generated  in the last four years but not in the UK 
or French  data which  is much  older.  Regardless  of the reason,  they do establish  
the need to have our own figures  on these feedstuffs.
Does the new energy  system  affect  the value  of feeds
It is common  practice  to value  feeds  in relation  to barley  and soyabean  meal  
as two reference  feeds  and to take into account  the energy  and protein  contents.  
Table  3 shows  the UFL(I),  ME and CP contents  of barley  and soyabean  meal,  
and a third feed, corn gluten,  whose  value we want to ascertain.  The price of 
barley  is taken  as £ 100/tonne  and the price  of soyabean  meal  is taken  as £230/  
tonne.  Using  the ME and CP values,  corn gluten  will have a value  of £131.48.  
However,  using  the UFL(I)  and CP values,  its value  is only £115.84.  Therefore  
the systems  we use have a large effect  on the value  we give a feed. Using  the 
ME values,  we would  consider  corn gluten  to be good value  at less than £131/  
tonne,  but it is actually  poor value at anything  more than £115/tonne  when  
considered  using the new energy  systems.
Table 3

as fed) and their cost/tonne

Barley 1.00 11,2 10.4 100
Soyabean  meal 1.02 11.5 16.8 230
Com gluten 0.92 10.9 19.8 ?
Farmers  who  do not buy straights  might  think  this point  is irrelevant  to them.  
But a compounder  using  ME and CP as the basis  for his formulations  will use 
more  com gluten  to the exclusion  of other  better  value  ingredients.  The effects
65
on concentrate  cost or quality  will not be huge,  but on a national  scale  I consider  
them significant.
Evaluating  forages
The energy  value  of forages  is given  in UFL(I)  per kg DM and is obviously  
very important  in determining  their feeding  value.  However  intake  is also an 
extremely  important  consideration  with forages.  The French  have published  
Fill Value  figures  for the voluntary  intake  of forages  relative  to that of spring  
grass  (which  is considered  the standard  forage).  For dairy  cows,  these  are given  
in lactating  fill units (LFU).  The higher  the value,  the lower  the intake.  Spring  
grass  is given  a value  of 1 and first cut grass  silage  might  have a value  of 1.27 
(i.e. 27% lower  than grass)  whereas  good quality  maize  silage  might  have a 
value of 1.13 (i.e. 13% lower  than grass).
An index  of the overall  feeding  value  of forages  would  be very useful  which  
would  take into account  its energy  content  and its intake  potential.  Again,  the 
French  have such an index  which  is called  the Ration  Energy  Density  (RED).  
The RED of a forage  is obtained  as follows:
RED = energy  content  (UFL(I)/kg  DM 
Fill Value  (LFU)
The higher  the RED,  the higher  the overall  feeding  value  of the forage.  Table  
4 shows  the energy  content,  the intake  capacity  and the RED of some  forages.  
These  are average  figures  and obviously  both the energy  content  and intake  
capacity  of individual  batches  will vary. Energy  content  can be predicted  from  
DMD  and recent  Hillsborough  work has made it possible  to get a Fill Value  
for a particular  batch  of silage.  The figures  in Table  4 show  the superiority  of 
grass to grass silage  and the superiority  of maize  silage  to grass silage.  This  
is mainly  due to its better  Fill Value  rather  than to a higher  energy  content.

and Feed Value (UFL)  into account
The PDI protein  system
The PDI system  aims to predict  the quantity  of amino  acids the cow will 
absorb  from  her diet. This can be limited  by either  nitrogen  or energy availability
66
in the rumen  which  are used in the production  of microbial  protein.  Energy  
is assessed  by the amount  of fermentable  organic  matter  available.  Thus,  there  
are two potential  amounts  of microbial  protein  production,  that from  available  
nitrogen  or that from available  fermentable  organic  matter.  The supply  of 
undegradable  protein  is added  to this giving  two potential  supplies of total amino  
acids:
PDIN  = PDI supply  when  degraded  dietary  N is limiting  
PDIE  = PDI supply  when  fermentable  organic  matter  is limiting
The supply  of each from the diet is calculated  and the lower  one is used  
as the actual supply  of amino  acids to the cow (the ideal situation  is where  
PDIN  = PDIE in the complete  diet, but this is not always  achievable).  The 
simplified  examples  below  demonstrate  the calculations  involved.  The following  
feeds, shown  with their respective  PDIE and PDIN  values,  are used.

Situation  A If the cow is eating  11 kg silage  DM, 4 kg barley  DM and 1 kg 
of soyabean  meal DM
PDIN  supply  = {(11 X 78) + (4 x 79) + (1 x 388)} = 1562 g/d 
PDIE supply  = {(11 X 62) + (4 x 102) + (1 x 263)} = 1353 g/d 
PDIE  < PDIN,  and so PDIE  is chosen  - i.e., PDI supply  = 1353 g/d. This is 
adequate  for a cow producing  21-22  kg milk at 30 g/kg protein  (Table  5).
Situation  B If the cow is eating  6.5 kg grass silage  DM, 6.5 kg maize  silage  
DM, 3 kg beet pulp DM and 1 kg of soyabean  meal DM
PDIN  supply={(6.5  x 78)-i-(6.5  x 50)+(3  x 66)-i-(l  x 388)}=1418  g/d 
PDIE  supply={(6.5  x 62)-i-(6.5  x 68)-(-(3  x 109)4-(1  x 263)}=1435  g/d 
PDIN  < PDIE,  and so PDIN  is chosen  - i.e., PDI supply  = 1418 g/d. This is 
adequate  for a cow producing  22-23  kg milk at 30 g/kg protein  (Table  5), with  
1 kg less concentrates  than when fed grass silage  only (situation  A).

With grass  silage  based  diets fed to milking  cows,  PDIE  is usually  limiting  
and the target  level in concentrates  is 125-130  g/kg as fed. This is difficult  to 
achieve.  Table  6 shows  the PDIE,  PDIN  and CP contents  of some  formulations.  
Formulation  1 is a simple  3 way mix of barley,  corn gluten  and distillers  grains.  
Formulations  2 and 3 use a larger  number  of ingredients.  Rapeseed  meal is the 
main protein  source  in 2 and high quality  cottonseed  meal is the main source  
in 3. All three are seriously  inadequate  in PDIE,  even though  all are between  
18 and 20% CP. This indicates  that with many  rations  of ‘normal ’ CP content,  
protein  nutrition  of the dairy cow is inadequate.
Formulations  4 shows  the inclusion  rate of soyabean  meal that would  be 
needed  to bring a concentrate  up to a PDIE  level of approximately  130 g/kg  
where  barley  is the only other  ingredient.  It is 30%. It is apparent  that it will 
be difficult  to design  concentrates  with 130 g/kg PDIE  or greater  which  implies  
that high milk protein  content  will be difficult  to achieve.  Formulation  5 is a 
typical concentrate  fed as a balancer  to maize  silage, being  24% CP. It is adequate  
in both PDIE  and PDIN.  This is most  likely  a contributing  factor  to the better  
milk protein  contents  on maize  silage  based  diets along with the higher  DM 
intakes.

Summary  and conclusions
Irish farmers  would  be better  served  by an energy  system  which  puts values  
on feeds  that reflects  animal  performance  on those  feeds.  It is wasteful  of Irish  
research  results  not to use them in a systematic  manner  to put values  on feeds.  
A net energy  system  is the obvious  vehicle  for this. We should  exercise  control  
over our own feed values.  Using  our knowledge  to put the best value we can 
on feeds  is essential  to getting  the best return  from  the huge  annual  expenditure  
on feedstuffs.  We need a vibrant  system  that is updated  as new information  
arises and we need to utilise  developments  abroad  such as the silage  intake  
prediction  from Hillsborough.  Newer  concepts  of protein  nutrition  also need  
to be taken on board.

International  Trends  in Dairying
P. WALSHE
Bishopswood,  Durrow,  Co. Laois.
As the debate  on the future  of milk production  in Europe  was intensifying,  
I examined  the dairy industry  in several  parts of the world  to see how people  
viewed  the future  of the industry  from  other  perspectives  and what  impact  this 
may  have  on the future  of Irish  production.  My study  tour  in 1996  was sponsored  
by the Farmers ’ Journal  and the Irish Farmers ’ Association.  The major  milk  
exporting  areas  were  of most  relevance. I visited  the US, then  Victoria  in Australia  
and continuing  to Chile,  Argentina  and Uruguay.
As shown  below,  world  milk production  has decreased  slightly  from 475 
m tonnes  in 1988 to 473 m tonnes  in 1996.  The largest  drop in production  is 
in the E.U. with Eastern  Europe  and Russia  also reducing.  Most other parts  
of the world are increasing  production  and developing  new markets  in the 
growing  economies  of Asia and Latin  America.  Milk consumption  in Brazil  
has increased  by 20% in the last 2-3 years and it is considered  that half of 
Brazil ’s 130 m people  have not tasted  dairy products  yet.

U.S.A.
In visiting  10 different  states,  I got some  appreciation  of the wide variation  
in climate  and conditions  across  the U.S. There  is one common  feature  - total 
confinement.  Over  90% of the dairy  cows  are never  managed  outdoors  unless  
they are in the warmer  states  where  they are confined  in roofless  corrals  and 
are never  released  to forage  for themselves.  This system  has been developed  
as a result of years of subsidised  agriculture.  Buildings  and machinery  in
70
particular  were cheap  and the typical  farm has a graveyard  of over 50 years  
machinery.  In the traditional  dairy  states  of MinnesotaAVinsconsin  and east of 
there  it is common  to see sheds  which  were once  dairy  farms  now abandoned.
Over the past ten years milk price has averaged  about 17.6 p per 1 but it 
has fluctuated  from the Government  guaranteed  price of about 14.5 p per 1 to 
just over  22.0 p per 1 in that period.  The record  high  of 22.4  p per 1 was reached  
in September  1996 but within  3 months  it had dropped  to below 16.5 p per 
1 equivalent.  This volatility  is caused  by supply/demand  variation  in what is 
basically  a “home ” market  - only 2 to 3% of total production  is exported.
Data  from  the U.S. Department  of Agriculture  show  that the cost  of producing  
milk  on the average  U.S.  dairy  farm in 1994  was 24.2 p per 1. The average  price  
paid for milk in the U.S. in 1996  was 17.6 p per 1. Farmers  are basically  living  
off depreciation  in this scenario.  Production  in traditional  eastern  States is 
dropping  and there is a move to bigger  units in the mid-west  and west. In 
Wisconsin  there  were 120,000 dairy  farms  in 1950;  there  are 26,000  today  and 
it is reckoned  that in 7-8 years at least half of these will be out of business.  
T. Graff  and Ed Jesse,  University  of Madison,  report  that the only solution  is 
a move to larger  units with economies  of scale. From what I saw, however,  
this is not always  the case.  The number  of cows  per labour  unit on some  large  
units is only 50 to 60. The very efficient  ones are achieving  100 but these  are 
few and far between.  Many  of the large farms  are dependent  on cheap  Mexican  
labour  to make a margin.
Costs  of feed production  and manure  handling  are increasing  more  rapidly  
than the price of milk, placing  an economic  squeeze  on farmers.  In addition,  
the capital  investment  that is perceived  to be necessary  is making  confinement  
dairying  uneconomic.  The problem  with confinement  dairying  is that there is 
a whole  infrastructure  built up around  it. Everybody  involved  in that 
infrastructure  makes  money  except  the dairy farmer  - feed  companies,  machinery  
companies,  veterinary  salesmen,  semen  salesmen  and other  support  services.  
There  is a distinct  lack of independent  support  for the farmer  to help him avoid  
the maze of propaganda  that is fired at him every day.
Across  the U.S. any farmer  with  a grazing  system  was hungry  for information  
and was delighted  to have a caller  who was not trying  to sell him something.  
I began  to appreciate  Moorepark  and the advisory  structure  in Ireland  a lot 
better  after this experience.
There  is a very slow move  towards  grazing  in the U.S., less than 10% of 
dairy farmers,  but it is seen by many as a last resort  before  bankruptcy.  It is 
for many  because  they do not unload  themselves  of the capital  burden  that was  
breaking  them in the first place.
Another  surprising  feature  is the lack of contract  operators  and the insistence  
of every  farmer  in having  his own machinery.  This includes  harvesting  maize  
and alfalfa  hay and all the other  work  involved  in confinement  dairying.  Hence,  
there is a massive  investment  in machinery  even on small  40 to 50 cow farms  
which  increases  milk costs.
Research  at Cornell  University  on grazing  showed  that the north-east  U.S. 
can grow  as much  grass  dry matter  in a season  as in Ireland.  It is slightly  later
71
starting  in the spring  but they  can grow more  in the autumn.  The main  difference  
is the cold  winter  during  which  ryegrass  will not survive.  Brome  grass is popular  
but is harder  to manage  and has lower  quality  than ryegrass.  Cocksfoot  is also 
quite  common.  The red clover  is excellent  and tends  to be dominant.  The same  
applies  in Wisconsin.  In northern  Wisconsin ryegrass  can be grown  successfully  
due to the climatic  effect  of the Great  Lakes.
The eastern  region  of Texas  to the Atlantic  coast  is a milk deficit  area and 
is therefore  the highest  milk price area - 2.2 p per 1 higher  than other areas.  
But costs are higher  here too. Heat stress  is common  as summer  temperatures  
are often above  100 degrees  F. Confinement  sheds  are fitted  with fans to cool 
down cows.  This is also a hurricane  area and electric  storms  are possible  at 
any time without  warning.
Idaho  is a fine example  of an expanding  dairy industry  which  has grown  
from $73 m in 1970  to $500  m in 1995 - a growth  rate of 23% per year. Idaho  
dairy farmers  produced  636 m litres of milk in 1970. In 1995 they produced  
1,873  m litres  from 1,162  farms  with an average  of almost  200 cows  per farm  
- an increase  of 194% in production.  Average  milk yield per cow increased  
from  4,4501  in 1970  to 8,1831  in 1995.  There  are about  15,000  people  employed  
in the production,  processing,  transport  and distribution  of milk.  Avonmore  has 
been part of this growth  in Idaho  since 1989 and now has three impressive  
processing  sites there.  The majority  of the growth  has come  from large units  
of more  than 1,000  cows  - with a typical  investment  being  over  $4,000  per cow. 
Corrals  are open because  of the low rainfall  and there is no need for cover  
except  to provide  shade.  These  large units tend to buy feed from small local  
farms.  Most  crops  are irrigated.  The best grazing  management  which  I saw in 
the U.S. was being  practised  by a New Zealander  in Idaho.  He was managing  
800 cows on a farm with very low capital  investment,  that is, stock, land,  
irrigation  and milk shed.
In the western  states  of Washington  and Oregon,  there is potential  to graze  
in a reasonably  temperate  climate  but the price  of land here means  that people  
are selling  and moving  to cheaper  areas. Grazing  is more common  but 
nevertheless  frowned  upon and poorly  managed.
Assessment
I was surprised  at the potential  to grow  grass in many  parts  of the U.S. and 
at the lack of knowledge  of good  grazing  technology.  The latter  probably  stems  
from  two generations  that have been  driven  by subsidised  agriculture  into high  
output  artificial  production  systems.  There  is a lack of independent  measurement  
and advice  available  to the farmer  who is very much  dependent  on commercial  
salesmen.  The advantages  of independent  research  and advice  were  immediately  
obvious.
The U.S. has a large home  market  for dairy produce  and exports  only 2% 
to 3% of its production.  The population  is growing  at the rate of 4 m per year 
and consumption  of dairy  products  is growing  also. Prices  are likely  to be more  
stable  in the U.S. without  supports  than in an Ireland  without  supports  because  
of the lack of dependence  on exports.  Fluctuation  in cereal  prices  caused  by
72
extremes  of weather  or over-production  would  seem  to be the main  factor  that 
will influence  production  of milk in the U.S. for the foreseeable  future.
AUSTRALIA
Victoria  has the greatest  potential  for expansion  in Australia.  The picture  
was very different  from the U.S., namely,  an industry  that was focused  and 
growing.  Australia  produces  8.2 billion  litres  of milk  per annum,  62% of which  
is produced  in Victoria.  Twenty-five  per cent of total Australian  milk is used  
for liquid  milk  consumption  with  home  consumption  of manufactured  products  
accounting  for a further  30% of production,  leaving  45% of total production  
for export.  But this is growing  (about  15% growth  in 1996)  and 56% of exports  
are to Asia and a further  18% to Japan.
Victoria  accounts  for 90% of total Australian  dairy exports;  production  in 
the other states is practically  all home consumed.  In each state there are 
regulations  governing  liquid  milk production  with the purchase  price on the 
farm;  the farmer  is guaranteed  almost  twice  the manufacturing  price for liquid  
milk. In 1996, the liquid  price was 25.3 p per 1. The manufacturing  price was 
13.6 p per 1.
Marketing  of manufactured  dairy products  is also covered  by an industry  
funded  market  support  scheme;  industry  funds are used to subsidise  exports.  
A levy is imposed  on all milk production,  including  liquid  milk (1 p per 1). 
This generates  a fund of about  £75 m which  is used to subsidise  less than half 
of the production  that is exported.  This will be reduced  because  of GATT  and 
cannot  be more than 10% of the export  price in 2000.
In the years 1990 to 1995 the number  of dairy  farmers  in Victoria  reduced  
by 5% while at the same time herd size increased  by 25%, milk production  
increased  by 35%,  milk yield  per cow increased  by 17% and concentrates  fed 
per cow increased  by 100%.  There  are now 8,236  dairy farms  in Victoria  with  
an average  of 142 cows  per farm  feeding  524  kg of grain  per cow and producing  
4,479 1 of milk per cow.
The main research  centre  is at Ellinbank,  east of Melbourne  in an area well 
suited  for grass growth.  Rainfall  is 1100mm;  average  summer  and winter  
temperatures  are 20° and 8° respectively;  the area is prone  to drought  in January.  
The centre  has 217 ha of land; there are 450 cows - 50 autumn  calving  and 
400 spring  calving.  The centre  has 15 research  staff, 19 technicians  and 13 farm  
stalf.
The role of Ellinbank  is to undertake  research,  development  and extension  
relevant  to south-east  Australia  and the main components  of the research  
programme  are: Fertility,  Environmental  impact  of fertilisers.  Animal  nutrition  
and pasture  utilisation.  Milk  harvesting  (machinery).  Milk  and product  quality.
The budget  in 1996 was IR£1.5  m funded  by the Dairy Research  and 
Development  Corporation  (DRDC)  which  also funds other research  centres,  
universities  and private  companies.  The DRDC  collects  its funds  from  a farmer  
levy of 2.3 c per kg butterfat  (0.2 p per gallon).  This money  is matched  £ for 
£ by the Federal  Government.  Their  levy was increased  to 2.9 c per kg butterfat  
in 1997 and raised  about IR£11.5  m for both research  and extension  work.
73
The most striking  feature  of Ellinbank  was the close relationship  between  
Research  & Extension.  The main extension  drive is through  Target  10 and it 
is also based  at Ellinbank.  Both  research  and extension  have  similar  objectives,  
one of which  is to increase  the amount  of pasture  consumed  per hectare.  The 
present  average  in Victoria  is 61 per ha, some  farms  are achieving  151 at present  
- the objective  is to increase  that figure  to 20 t DM consumed  per ha. One of 
the principal  methods  of getting  the message  across  to farmers  is by using  A.B.C.  
Farms  - 3 small  farms  near the research  station  where  regular  farm walks  are 
held.
Assessment
Victorian  dairy  farming  is an industry  geared  up to expand.  Close  integration  
of research,  extension  and education and a clear  focus  on production  from  pasture  
is sure to pay dividends  from Victoria ’s cheapest  resource.  There  is also the 
advantage  of a reasonable  home  market  (55% of production)  where  consumption  
is growing,  and access  to the Asian  market  which  is being  developed  as fast 
as possible.  The Australian  Dairy  Council,  which  promotes  dairy  products  but 
does not sell them,  is operating  in several  countries  in Asia.  The levy on milk,  
including  liquid  milk, is using  the Australian  consumer  to subsidise  exports.  
The fact that the Government  sets the liquid  price  is a price  support  which  does  
not cost the Government  money. A  very large  levy in Ireland  would  be required  
in order  to have the same effect.
CHILE
Total milk production  in Chile  is about  a quarter  that of Ireland  at 1.7 m 
tonnes.  Up to 20% of this production  is in chums  but from 1998 churns  will 
not be allowed.  The Government  has set up an advisory  service  to help small  
farmers  (less than 80 ha); 60% of farms are less than this and they produce  
30% of the milk. Some  of the advisers  are trying  to set up co-ops  with storage  
centres  for cooling  milk for these small producers.
There  are 17 milk purchasers  in Chile  but they are not all processing.  About  
70% of the industry  is controlled  by Nestle  (Swiss),  Soprole  (50% owned  by 
N.Z. Dairy Board)  and Paramalat  (Italian).  These  companies  are using their  
position  in Chile  to bring in products  from abroad.  In 1995 Brazil  increased  
its tax on Chilean  milk imports  from 10% to 16% because  they believe  that 
cheap  N.Z. product  is coming  to Brazil  via Chile.  Chile  started  exporting  dairy  
products  only five years ago; exports  were worth  $25 m in 1995 and $35 m 
in 1996.
Farmers  are being  forced  into all year round  production  because  processors  
are trying  to flatten  the production  curve  in order  to utilise  capacity.  Farmers  
who produce  milk all year round  receive  18.7 p per 1 and smaller  farmers  who 
produce  seasonal  milk  receive  only 10 to 11 p perl.  The latter  are under  pressure  
from processors.  Production  is growing  at up to 20% per year and there will 
be a need for major  investment  in processing  capacity  to maintain  this growth.  
The only subsidy  available  is a free advisory  service  to small farmers  (under  
80 ha). These  farmers  have 80 to 100 cows and very poor facilities.  Mobile  
milking  parlours  are common.
74
Nestle  exercises  a high degree  of control  in this country.  At least 25% of 
the products  on the shelves  were  Nestle:  milk,  butter, yoghurts,  flavoured  milks  
in large  supplies,  condensed  milk,  powdered  milk,  baby  foods,  breakfast  cereals,  
biscuits,  chocolate,  cream,  coffee  and many more.
Assessment
While  there are some  excellent  grass farmers  in Chile  the majority  of milk  
is produced  in confinement  operations  or a mixture  of both.  There  is much  U.S. 
influence  particularly  in liquid milk producing  areas near the centres  of 
population.  Keenans  have  penetrated  the market  here for diet feeders  very well.  
Average  farm  size is quite  large. The farm  owner  often  lives  in a city and comes  
to the farm 1-2 days a week.  Because  of this, the farm is dependent  on poorly  
educated  workers.  The industry  will grow steadily  but potential  is limited  by 
lack of good  research,  extension  and education.  Little  product  is exported  and 
with a population  of 15 m people  and consumption  growing,  Chile will be 
cushioned  from the instability  of the world  market.
ARGENTINA
Milk  production  in Argentina  has grown  at about 10% per year since 1989  
and is now  estimated  to be 9 m tonnes  per year  - almost  twice  the Irish  production.  
Of this, 25% is in liquid  milk consumption  and 45% is cheese.  Only 8% of 
production  is exported  but this is growing  rapidly.  Brazil  is a huge market  of 
130 m people  and as its economy  grows,  food consumption  is increasing.  
Argentina,  Brazil,  Paraquay  and Uruguay  have a common  trading  block  called  
Mericosur  which  gives  Argentina  and Uruguay  as dairy  exporters  priority  access  
to the Brazilian  market.  Chile  is being  encouraged  into the group  for access  
to the Pacific  and exports  to Asia.
The main dairy producing  area is in the province  of Santa Fe where  the 
number  of dairy  farmers  has dropped  in the last 20 years  from 15,262  to 5,664.  
In the same  period, cow numbers  dropped  by only 5%,  while  production  doubled  
and productivity  per hectare  increased  from a very low 30 kg butterfat  per ha 
to 133 kg per ha. Number  of cows  per farm increased  from 40 to 95; average  
size of dairy farms increased  from 85 ha to 100 ha from 1975 to 1996.
The main dairy research  centre  is in Rafaela  and is leading  the drive for 
increased  production.  Results  show that production  can be doubled.  Traditional  
farms  are averaging  3,000  to 4,0001  per cow per lactation  while  better  farmers  
are achieving  5,500  to 6,000 1 per cow. In Rafaela  Research  Centre  they are 
achieving  7,500  to 8,000 1 per lactation.  The average  stocking  rate on more  
traditional  farms  is less than 1 cow per ha while at the research  centre  it is 
between  2.0 and 2.5 cows per ha.
The main forage  consists  of alfalfa  pasture,  brome  grass/cocksfoot/clover  
pasture,  some annual  ryegrass,  alfalfa  hay, maize  silage  and concentrate.  
Perennial  ryegrass  cannot  be grown  because  of the heat - over 30 degrees  in 
the summer.  Management  of pasture  is difficult  due to types  of grasses  but the 
alfalfa  hay and maize  silage  are consistently  high in quality.  Pasture  must be 
reseeded  every  4 to 5 years.  Concentrates  are cheap,  £100 to £120  per tonne.
75
Farms  are well fenced  and are equipped  with windmills  bringing  up water  
from  the high  water  table.  No buildings  of any significance  are to be seen,  pointing  
to low investment  as a major  advantage.  Milking  parlours  are only now becoming  
common.  Animals  are managed  outdoors  all year round  and hay, silage,  etc. is 
fed under  electric  wires on top of the ground.  If the ground  becomes  mucked  
up, cows are moved  to a new site. Concentrates  are fed in parlours  all year 
round  and as calving  is all-year-round  it is difficult  to estimate  the amount  fed. 
It is generally  ad-lib  while milking  and is estimated  to be over 2 tonnes  per 
cow per year on most farms.
Thirty  five per cent of the milk is processed  by co-operatives  and 65% by 
private  companies.  The largest  processor  is a co-operative  called  Sancor  with  
about  20% of the total.  The top 5 processors  account  for 75% of the total.  There  
are many  small  processors  and purchasers  who  Just  sell on the milk  for processing.  
The supply  curve  is fairly  flat with the spring  only 25% higher  than the lowest  
point.
The vast plains  of arable  land in Argentina  and the farm structure  make  it 
one of the best regions  in the world  for farming.  It is possible  to produce  milk  
here all year round  at low cost. If production  were seasonal  it would  be even  
lower  cost but because  of the lack of farmer  control  of the industry  at processing  
level, farmers  are forced  into all-year  production.
Conclusions
1. Research
Moorepark  Research  Centre  is one of the best dairy  research  facilities  in the 
world  and is the best centre  for grass utilisation.  This gives the Irish industry  
an advantage  that must be continued.
2. Research-Extension  link
A greater  link between  research  and extension  is needed  in Ireland. In Australia  
and New Zealand  and also Argentina  where  the industry  is growing,  the link 
between  research  and extension  is very strong.  A sizeable  proportion  of the 
producer  levies  is spent  on extension.  In Ireland  all the levy  is spent  on research  
and the link between  research  and extension  is poor. I believe  that researchers  
should  keep in contact  regularly  with a number  of farms in order to keep in 
touch  with  problems.  Likewise  the advisors  should  have  a greater  role in research.
3. Grass varieties
There  is need  for a major  international  research  programme  between  Ireland,  
the U.K.,  Australia  and New Zealand  to develop  more  productive  varieties  of 
ryegrass.  In north  America  the development  of maize  is proceeding  so fast that 
it is moving  north at the rate of 10 km per year. Developments  in crops like 
barley  and wheat  are to be seen in Ireland;  7.5 1 of spring  barley  per ha is common  
and 12.5 t of wheat  per ha is being achieved.  Genetic  progress  in maize  is 
increasing  yields  by about  4% per annum  and by 1.5 to 2.0% in wheat  and 
barley.  The seed companies  are investing  massive  amounts  of money  into 
researching  new varieties.  Because  grass  is not sown  every  year,  seed  companies  
are not inclined  to put as much into researching  new varieties.
76
4. Capital  investment
Teagasc should  demonstrate  systems  of dairy farming  which  have  low capital  
investment.  We should  make  better  use of shelter  belts instead  of concrete  and 
it would  be more environmentally  friendly.  One obvious  feature  on my tour 
was that a large  capital  investment  tended  to be the millstone  around  the farmer ’s 
neck.  In contrast,  anywhere  the industry  was expanding,  e.g. the western  USA  
with large outdoor  corrals  or in the southern  hemisphere  on pasture  based  
systems,  the capital  investment  was low.
In Ireland,  farmers  with small  quotas  spend  large  sums  of money  on slatted  
tanks  and elaborate  facilities  which  leaves  them  in debt even after  grants.  The 
industry  cannot  support  the type  of capital  investment  that has become  the norm  
especially  in a world  of freer trade.
5. Fertility
More  research  is required  into fertility and  embryonic  death  in high  producing  
animals  in order  to maintain  a 365-day  interval.  This is essential  for seasonal  
grass based production.
6. Processing  industry
One of the great advantages  that Ireland  enjoys  is farmer  control  of its 
processing  industry.  It is important  that farmers  retain  this control.  In Chile,  
Argentina  and the U.S. private  industry  has forced  farmers  into all-year-round  
production  at farm level in order  to provide  them with a level supply  of raw 
material.  This reduces  processing  costs but the savings  are not passed  on to 
the farmer.  The board  members  of our co-ops  have large responsibilities  to 
ensure  a well run business  while  at the same time ensuring  maximum  return  
to the farmer  share-holder.  Share-holders  should  take note of this when  electing  
board  members.  This is particularly  true of co-op  controlled  pic’s. In Western  
Australia  a former  dairy co-op that went fully pic and expanded  into other  
businesses  such  as oil and fertilisers,  eventually  sold  off  its dairy  business  because  
it was not profitable  enough.  This company  lost sight of its roots. Who is to 
say that this could  not happen  in Ireland?  Can the level of growth  expected  
by the stock  exchange  investor  be sustained  long-term?
1. Growing  markets
Our  politicians  must  ensure  fair access  to growing  markets  in the next  world  
trade negotiations.  Europe  must argue strongly  for greater  access  to South  
American  and Asian  markets  because  the US and Cairns  Group  are trying  to 
exclude  us from  thriving  economies  and fence  us into a European  market  which  
is losing  its importance.
8. Liquid  consumption
There  will always  be milk  production  near  centres  of population  and demand  
will ensure  that there  is a constant  supply  of milk for liquid  consumption.  The 
farm price for this milk can be up to twice  the price for manufacturing  milk  
e.g. Australia.  In some  countries  this accounts  for 100%  of production  at various  
times  of the year. Also near centres  of population,  there are often  by-products  
of other food industries  which  provide  feed for dairy cows at low cost.
77
9. World  market
Only 6% of total world  production  is traded  across  international  borders.  
Of the countries  that are trading  on that market  only two are dependent  on 
exporting  over 80% of their production:  Ireland  80%; New Zealand  80%;  
Denmark  50%;  Holland  40%;  Australia  45%;  Argentina  8%; U.S. 2-3%.  These  
figures  are important  because  of the stability  a large home market  gives to 
producer  prices  particularly  if a large  percentage  of production  is in liquid  milk.  
Because  of this factor,  Irish and New Zealand  prices  are the most likely to 
fluctuate  if there  was an open  market.  Ireland  has more  access  to the European  
market  which  should  give some  cushion  but we have seen in the past that this 
might  be of little use when  the pressure  intensifies,  as was the case in the BSE  
disaster.  To move  into fresh products,  there must be a large home  market  to 
fall back  on when  surpluses  arise.  There  may be niches  for some  fresh  products  
but they will only require  a small  volume  of milk and this can be supplied  on 
contract  as Baileys  is at present.
10. Infrastructure
All countries  have a higher  herd size than Ireland  and a lower  number  of 
herds  relative  to their  milk  production:  U.S. 80 cows,  Victoria  142 cows.  New  
Zealand  200 cows, Chile  80 cows,  Argentina  95 cows,  Denmark  50 cows,  Ireland  
32 cows. When  we joined  the EEC in 1973, Ireland  and Denmark  both had 
about  74,000  dairy  farmers.  Denmark  has a milk  quota  the same  size as Ireland.  
It presently  has 12,000  dairy farmers  with an average  of 50 cows each. The 
Danes  are restructuring  their industry  in order to be ready when quotas  go. 
They  have  already  decided  that they require  5,000  farmers  with 100 cows  each  
by 2005.
Milk quota  management  policy  in Ireland  has clearly  been much less 
aggressive  and has sought  to give smaller  producers  a chance.  Now that the 
Santer  proposals  are on the table,  it is likely  though  not certain  that the quota  
regime  will be retained  until 2006.  It is, however,  clear  that sooner  or later it 
will be abolished  and dairy  farmers  will have  to contend  with  world  milk  prices.  
It is vital that we use the transition  period  to prepare  for a more  competitive  
production  environment.  We will have fewer  dairy farmers  in years  to come.
Commins  and Frawley  (1995)  predicted  that there will be 79,000  farmers  
in Ireland'in  2005.  If present  trends  continue,  only 16,000  of these  will be dairy  
farmers  with an average  of about 50 cows each.
Efficient  small  dairy  farmers  must  be given  an opportunity  to increase  their  
scale.  It is my view  that, in a world  price  environment,  a specialist  dairy  farmer  
will need at least 60-80  cows to earn the same margin  as he does now with  
30 cows  within  the present  milk  quota  regime.  Less  efficient  small  dairy  farmers  
must be given  opportunities  to boost  their farm income  with alternative  farm  
enterprises  and/or  off-farm  employment.

Milk Quota  Policies
M. DOWLING
Former  Secretary,  Department  of Agriculture  and Food, Dublin.
Why quotas?
Throughout  the late 1970s  and early 1980s  the Community  grappled  with  
the budgetary  and market  problems  created  by rising  milk  production.  Prudent  
or frozen  prices,  producer  levies  and non marketing  schemes  had failed  to deal 
with the problem.  The result  was that the Community ’s self sufficiency  ratio  
in milk which  was only marginally  over 100% when we joined  in 1973 was 
about  123%  ten years  later.  Despite  an active  export  policy,  increasing  production  
was by that time pushing  butter  intervention  stocks  towards  1.5 m tonnes  and 
skim powder  stocks  towards  1 m tonnes.  Even with massive  subsidisation  - 
FEOGA  expenditure  in the milk  sector  rose from 1.6 to 4.4 b ECU  in the 1973-  
83 period  - there were no sustainable  market  outlets  for such stocks.  Indeed  
the Community  was eventually  forced  to subsidise  both butter  fat and skim  
powder  in the manufacture  of calf milk replacer  - such an inherently  illogical  
subsidy  might  be accepted  as a short  term emergency  measure,  it could  not be 
justified  as part of any longer  term stock disposal  programme.
In those  circumstances  the Community  was  forced  to take action.  There  were  
only two choices:
— a very sharp price reduction,  or
— tight supply  control.
The prevailing  wisdom  was that the price  cut would  need  to be of up to 25%  
to offer  a reasonable  prospect  of solving  the problem  and, even then,  could  not 
be guaranteed  to do so in the short to medium  term at least. Member  States,  
led by Germany  in particular,  recoiled  from the price  cut prospect  and in 1984  
opted for quotas,  warts and all.
And there  were  warts  - production  rigidities,  disincentives  to innovation  and 
development,  loss of export  markets  and vast  bureaucracy. But, within  the limited  
objectives  set for them,  quotas  - admittedly  having  been subsequently  adjusted  
by 8.5%  because  of setting  them  too high  in the first  place  - have  been  successful.  
Expenditure  in the milk  sector  which  was about  35% of total  FEOGA  Guarantee  
expenditure  on the introduction  of quotas,  is now less than 10% of total  
expenditure. EU self  sufficiency  is well  under  110%  and  milk  prices  for producers  
have  remained  relatively  high.  Irish  prices  in real terms have  on average  remained  
at their 1983 levels.
Current  position
Quotas  were initially  set generally  at 1981 output  levels  plus 1%. For most  
Member  States  that represented  sharp cuts in production  compared  to 1983 
levels.  There  were some exceptions,  most notably  Ireland,  which  was given  
a quota  equal  to 1983  plus  4.6%  - about  23%  above  1981 delivery  levels.  Quotas  
have been adjusted  on a number  of occasions  since 1984 - on balance  
substantially  downwards  but with some upward  movement  also which  was
79
generally  small but, in Ireland ’s case, reasonably  substantial  as a result  of the 
Mulder  adjustments.  The current  Irish quota  is almost  3.5% below  the quota  
level  set in 1984  but about  1 % above  1993  delivery  levels.  By contrast  the current  
quotas  in the other  main milk producing  member  States  are between  10% and 
15% below 1983 delivery  levels.
That is where  we now are. The questions  are where  do we wish to go and 
where  are we likely  to go. The answer  to the latter  question  is influenced  by 
economic  factors  but even  more  so by political  considerations  - national,  European  
and international,  in the guise  of the WTO.  The considerations  influencing  the 
answer  to the former  are no less political  but of a more national  flavour.  The 
current  position  is that the quota  regime  is in place  up to the end of 1999.  Without  
a decision  in the Council  to continue  it, it lapses  at that time. A decision  to 
extend  the regime  requires  a Commission  proposal  and a qualified  majority  in 
the Council  - 62 votes  out of 87. As of now, there  are at least  5 member  States,  
representing  35 votes,  who  do not favour  continuation  of the system in its present  
form.  Thus,  extension  of the regime  requires  a proposal  for a regime  sufficiently  
changed  to be acceptable  to at least  some  of those  member  States  or one which  
is part of a package  which  is, in overall  terms,  acceptable  to them.  That, to a 
considerable  extent,  explains  both why the new quota  proposal  is placed  within  
the Agenda  2000 package  and the nature  of the proposal  itself.
Agenda  2000
Agenda  2000, in its milk section,  proposes:
• a 15% cut in support  prices;
• premium  payments  in part compensation,  and
• maintenance  of the quota  regime  to 2006, with a 2% increase  in quotas  - 
1 % for all member  States  for distribution  with priority  to young  farmers  
and 1 % for distribution  to farmers  in mountain  regions.
The method  of distribution  proposed  would  result  in increased  quota  allocations  
of:
1 % for Belgium,  Denmark,  Ireland,  Luxembourg,  the Netherlands  and the UK; 
1.3% for Germany;
2.3% for France  and Sweden;
2.9% for Greece  and Portugal;
3% for Italy;
4% for Spain;  7.8% for Austria,  and 
8.4% for Finland.
In addition  Austria  and Finland  would  have further  increases  in quota  of 7.8%  
and 8.4% made available  to them to meet claims  from SLOM  producers.
Introducing  some flexibility  to the regime,  especially  to meet the needs  of 
new entrants  and certain  regions,  is necessary  in itself  and, in particular,  to sway  
some  of the member  States  at present  opposed  to the extension  of the regime.  
Therefore,  it was  inevitable  that there  would  be a proposal  which  involved  some  
additional  quota  and a method  of distribution  of the extra  quota  based  on objective  
criteria  which  would  have  the incidental  effect  of skewing  the allocation  towards  
sensitive  member  States.  Inevitably  also, there would  be a cautious  approach
80
to deciding  on the amount  of the extra quota  to be proposed  in order not to 
risk destabilising  the market.
Even  seen in that context,  however,  the present  proposal  is seriously  flawed  
because;
- it is overcautious  in regard  to the amount  of extra  quota  to be provided;
- the disparity  between  the treatment  of the individual  member  States  is 
grossly  excessive;
- two of the member  States  whose  views  on the extension  of the system  
may need to be changed  are in the lowest  increase  category;
- a number  of member  States  whose  support  would  normally  be expected  
will feel themselves  hard done by;
- the Mediterranean  bloc may still not be satisfied  with the additional  
quantities  proposed,  and
- the economic  rationale  of the proposal  is, to say the least, questionable.  
It is impossible  to see the proposal  adopted  as it stands.  But neither  is it likely  
that what has been offered  can be significantly  withdrawn.  Therefore,  almost  
certainly  the solution  will be an increase  in the overall  additional  quota  in order  
to provide  for a certain  degree  of equality  of distribution  among  member  States  
who would  then be given greater  flexibility  in the subsequent  national  
distribution.
There  is, however,  a limit  on the extra  quota  which  may be made  available  
and it is not just the limit of what  the market  will bear. There  is a clear  WTO  
constraint  also.  The Uruquay  Round  agreement  required  the EU to reduce  overall  
support  levels  by 20% compared  to the 1986-88  base. But it also required  that 
support  levels  in any individual  sector  could  not exceed  the levels  which  applied  
in 1992.  Thus,  an increase  in quota  levels,  offset  in terms  of measuring  support  
by a cut in price, would  not break that provision.  Indeed,  roughly  speaking,  
each 1 % price cut would  allow a 2% increase  in quota.  Complication  arises,  
however,  where  the price cut is, as is now proposed,  being at least partially  
offset  by direct  payments. Such  payment  must  be taken  into account  in calculating  
support  levels  for this provision.  The current  Commission  proposal  would  not, 
in my view, bring support  levels  above  the 1992 levels.  Indeed,  there would  
be scope  for a further  4% or so quota  increase  and still remain  within  the 1992  
support  levels,  if the other  elements  of the Commission  proposal  remained  in 
place. But any significant  improvement  in the compensation  element  of the 
proposal  would  eliminate  the possibility  of further  - or, depending  on the extent  
of the improvement,  any - quota  increase.  There  is also, of course,  the question  
of how much  extra production  the market  could  easily  absorb.  Recent  work  
done here would  suggest  that, with a reduction  of 15% in EU price levels,  a 
gradual  4% increase  in quota  would  not destabilise  the market.  In my view  this 
would,  as already  explained,  be comfortably  compatible  with the WTO  
commitment.
Next WTO  Round
This  is on the reasonable  assumption  that the provision,  or a somewhat  similar  
updated  one, will be carried  into the next Round.  Indeed  consideration  of this
81
issue  in that context  underlines  one every  important  fact - developments  in the 
WTO  will have a major  impact  on the practicality  if the EU maintaining  the 
quota  regime  into the longer  term.
We will begin negotiating  a new Round  next year. There  are two general  
points  about that negotiation  which  are worth  noting:
• It will not take the same protracted  length  of time as did the last one. 
Issues  of principle  were settled  in the Uruquay  Round,  as were  
implementation  mechanisms  such as the support  measurement  system  
and the tariffication  procedure.  They will not have to be settled  again.
• It will maintain  the liberalisation  of the last Round.
That means  that we could see the outcome  of the WTO  agreement  being  
applied  as from  the end of the current  period  and that the tariff  reduction  process  
would  continue  at, at least, the same pace in the 2001-2006  period  as it did 
in the 1995-2001  years.
The new buying  in prices  which  would  emerge  from the Santer  proposals  are 
equivalent  to about 117p per gallon  gross.  If - and this is the least we could  
expect  - tariff  reduction  in the new WTO  round  takes place at the same rate 
(6% a year)  as generally  applied  in the Uruquay  Round,  then, in  milk  equivalent  
terms,  the tariff  at the end of the round  would  be about  42p per gallon  gross.  
Assuming  that world  prices  do not fall, that would  leave the landed  price of 
milk products  in Europe  up to 20% above  the buying  in prices.  Thus  EU milk  
prices  would  still be adequately  protected  and so, seen in that context,  the 
continuation  of quotas  can be justified.
Some factors  could,  however,  emerge  which  would  upset that relatively  
benign  scenario.  Firstly,  tariff  reductions  might  be greater  (e.g. based  on the 
original,  rather  than the bound  rates) although  this is, in my view, unlikely.  
Secondly,  world  prices  might  fall as the EU and others increase  milk  production.  
On balance,  however,  it would  seem  that there  is likely  to be a sufficient  margin  
to give adequate  protection  even if international  prices  fall.
The process  of tariff  reduction  is likely,  however,  to be relentless  and to 
continue  beyond  the next Round.  If so, before  the end of the decade,  the tariff  
would  not be sufficient  to protect  the EU price (indeed,  if EU prices  were not 
to be reduced  by the Santer  15%, that situation  would  arise by the end of the 
next Round).  That would  happen  first in regard  to butter  but would  eventually  
apply  to the other  dairy  products  as well. At that stage  the case for maintaining  
quotas  would  not be sustainable.
Effect  of enlargement
The enlargement  process  will reinforce  the economic  pressure  for quota  
dismantlement.  Nobody  will want  to see quotas  introduced  in the new member  
States.  The administrative  complexity  of introducing,  and enforcing,  quotas  in 
those countries  is daunting.  Even the basis on which  to establish  quotas  in 
agricultural  economies  in transition  from centrally  planned  regimes  would  be 
very difficult  to decide  on. But if nobody  wants  to introduce  quotas  then,  neither  
will anyone  in the existing  Union  wish  to see quotas  retained  here while  farmers  
are free to produce  without  restriction  in the new areas.
82
What  the future  holds
These  factors,  together  with the strong  anti-quota  attitude  of a big minority  
of existing  member  States,  makes  the demise  of the regime  inevitable.  And  they 
may,  in fact,  cause  quotas  to be ended  a little  earlier  than is economically  strictly  
necessary.  So, if - as I think  is almost  certain  - quotas  are to be extended  for 
the six years  up to April  2006,  this is highly likely  to be the last such  unconditional  
extension.  If I am right, then two questions  arise:
- how will quotas  be ended,  and
- will farmers  be compensated?
The first question  involves  consideration  of whether  quotas  will be eliminated  
in one step or in phases.  If the Council  were to decide  in the Santer  package  
that quotas  will definitely  end in 2006,  then phasing  would  not arise.  I believe  
that that is unlikely  and that the issue  will probably  be fudged  in the agreement  
on the Santer  package.  In that event,  the most  likely  scenario  is a decision  closer  
to 2006  to phase  out quotas  over  a period  of years  in combination  with further  
cuts in support  prices  and other changes  in the support  system.
Will there be compensation?  I would  think the answer  to that is yes. The 
question  is how will compensation  be paid - for the quotas  or in respect  of 
lower  milk  prices?  The former  would  be cheaper  in that only those  with  existing  
quotas  would  benefit  and thus, for instance,  there would  be no question  of 
producers  in the new member  States  having  to be taken  into account.  It would,  
however,  almost  certainly  be once off or at least time limited  and digressive.  
Compensation  for lower  milk prices  would  be likely  to be longer  lasting  but 
would  in time extend  to new entrants  to milk production  and to those in the 
new member  States.  It would,  however,  be in line with the premium  regime  
being  proposed  in the Santer  package  and with  recent  European  Court  judgements  
which  have seen quotas  more as a licence  to produce  than a capital  asset.  At 
this stage this is a difficult  one to call, but, on balance,  my money  would  be 
on a compensation  system  related  to lower  milk prices.
Conclusion  - What  does Ireland  need?
Finally,  what  do we want  in Ireland?  I suspect  that the m^ority  of existing  
dairy farmers  would  like to see the quota  system  maintained  more or less as 
it is. But, for the reasons  already  mentioned,  I do not believe  that that is an 
option  into the longer  term/  In any event,  as the WTO  constraints  tighten  - and 
limitations  on subsidised  exports  as well as the tariffication  process  will put 
increasing  pressure  on prices - it is very doubtful  that it is in our interests  
to try to maintain  quotas  indefinitely.  In the circumstances  likely to prevail,  
they could  be maintained,  if at all, only at the expense  of sharp  cuts in production.
At the same time a sudden  abandonment  of quotas  would  cause very  
substantial  disruption  in the sector  and real hardship  to very many  farmers.  It 
is, therefore,  in our interests  to see the quota  system  extended  for a period  but 
on terms  which  would  help to ease the way towards  its inevitable  elimination.  
This involves  decisions  to be taken as part of the Santer  package  and those  
which  might  follow  a few years thereafter.
83
In my view, our interests  might  best be secured  by a package  of measures  
along  the following  lines:
1) Extension  of the quota  system  for a further  5 to 6 years.
2) The maximum  increase  in quotas  which  is technically  possible  and 
consistent  with what the market  can bear.
3) Use of the additional  quota  over and above  what the Commission  has 
proposed  to redress  the imbalance  in its proposal.
4) Provision  of compensation  which  in general  is no greater  than that 
proposed  by the Commission  - to increase  that significantly  would  limit  
the possibilities  for increased  quota.
5) If there  is an Irish  case  for improved  compensation  - and the continuation  
of the maize  silage  aid may  provide  one - then  it would  be better  exercised  
in seeking  to improve  our envelope  and use the result  to deal with any 
anomalies  thrown  up by the way the general  dairy premium  is to be 
calculated.
6) Maintenance  of the proposed  15% price  cut - anything  lower  would  not 
allow  any significant  exports  without  refund  and these  are necessary  if 
market  balance  is to be maintained.
7) A decision  on the phasing  out of quotas  to be taken some  years  in advance  
of the start of that process.
8) Payment  of compensation  to all dairy farmers,  by way of a dairy cow 
premium  or an area  based  premium,  for the lower  milk  prices  rather  than 
compensation  just to those holding  milk quotas  at the time of their  
elimination.  This would  bring  greater  longer  term benefit  to the sector  
and encourage  a more rational  development  of production.
9) In the  WTO  agreement,  change  the balance  in the tariff  reduction  process  
in favour  of butter  and against  skim  powder,  as the butter  price  will come  
under  pressure  from the import  price much  sooner  than the skim price  
(the balance  was the other way in the Uruquay  Round  agreement).
I believe  that represents  the best way forward  for us. Obviously  not all will 
agree - particularly,  perhaps,  in regard  to compensation  and the price cut 
suggestions.  But staying  where  we are is not an option.  Therefore,  we need  
to be thinking  seriously  about  where  we want  to go. The quota  system  and the 
questions  of how it is to be continued,  modified  and eventually  phased  out are 
fundamental  to the milk sector  and we need some  fundamental  thinking  about  
the answers  to these  questions.  I have  put forward  these  ideas  to this conference  
as a small contribution  to the debate.  I will be interested  in the response.

Feeding  Strategies  Used by Specialised  
Winter  Beef Finishers:  Growth,  
Efficiency  and Cost of Gain

Introduction
Winter  finishing  is one of many  beef  production  systems  operated  in Ireland.  
In this system,  cattle are purchased  in the autumn,  grown  at a high target  rate 
during  the winter  months  before  slaughter  from January  onwards.  Profitability  
in this, as in any beef enterprise,  is influenced  by many factors  including  the 
buying  and selling  price,  daily liveweight  gain, input  costs and the availability  
of slaughter  premia.  In the Teagasc  winter  finishing  budget  shown  in Table 1, 
“excellent ” performance  (i.e. margin)  over production  costs is obtained  from a 
daily liveweight  gain of 1.1 kg with a feed (grass  silage  and concentrates)  cost 
of £1.15/day.  Since the sensitivity  analysis  (Table  2) shows  that animal  
performance  makes  a large  contribution  to the gross  margin  per hectare  realised  
by the producer  it is imperative  for profitability that performance  be at a maximum  
but at a minimum  ration  cost.
Based  on studies  at Grange  Research  Centre  where  concentrates  were  offered  
ad libitum,  the growth  potential  of finishing  continental  steers in a non­
compensatory  growth  situation  is 1.16 to 1.25 kg/day  (Moloney  and O’Kiely,  
1995;  French  et ai, 1997; Keane,  1995).  Similar  studies  at University  College  
Dublin  indicated  a growth  potential  of 1.03 kg/day  for steers (O’Mara  et al, 
1996).  However,  finishing  continental  cattle  which  were  likely  exhibiting  some  
compensatory  growth  potential  had growth  rates  of 1.42 kg/day  for steers  (French  
et al, 1997)  and 1.35 kg/day  for heifers  (Gottstein  et ai, 1997).  Growth  rates,  
similar  or greater  than these are often claimed  in practice.  Thus, exploiting  
compensatory  growth  and/or  using  alternate  feedstuffs  such  as sugar  beet,  fodder  
beet, home  grown  cereals  or by-products  may result  in higher  performance  at 
a lower  feed cost than indicated  in the Teagasc  budget  (Table  1). Since  animal  
growth  is the product  of intake  by the energy  density  of the diet, such  performance  
may reflect  intakes  in practice  that are higher  than usually  seen in a research  
environment  (18 g dry matter  (DM)/kg  body  weight, approximately).  The objective  
of the study summarised  in this paper  was to identify  some  strategies  used by 
specialised  winter  finishers  and to quantify  the performance,  intake  and feed 
costs on these farms.

• On each farm, a group  of animals  was identified  for this study.  After the 
animals  had adapted  to the housing  facilities  and the diet (~ 3 weeks),  they 
were weighed  on two consecutive  mornings  before  feeding.  The animals  
were again  weighed  twice  (on all but 2 of the 10 farms)  at the end of the 
finishing  period.  The average  of each pair of weights  for each animal  was 
used in the calculation  of growth  rate.
• Slaughter  data were collected  (where  possible)  for each individual  animal.
• The accuracy  of the feeder  wagon  was tested  by unloading  it onto  a calibrated  
Teagasc  scales  and comparing  the readings  on the feeder  wagon  with the 
weight  of material  unloaded.
• Feed  intake  was measured  by recording  the amount  of each  ingredient  offered  
during  a 7 day period  (two measurement  periods  on some farms)  and 
subtracting  the weight  of feed not eaten during  the recording  period.
• Samples  were taken  of each individual  feed on 2 or more  occasions  during  
the period  of feed intake  measurement.  These  samples  were chemically  
analysed  at Grange  Research  Centre.
• Feeding  and husbandry  practices  were monitored  (feeding  methods  and 
routine,  feed space per animal,  parasite  control,  etc.).
Results
The experiment  was carried  out between  November  1997 and March  1998 
(when  final cattle were slaughtered).  The 10 farms chosen  (labelled  A to J) 
were in counties  Kildare  (3), Carlow  (4) and Laois  (3). General  procedures  on 
each farm are summarised  in Table  3. Each  farm used a feeder  wagon  (various  
suppliers).  The difference  between  the amount  of feed  discharged  from  the feeder  
wagon  and the reading  on the feeder  wagon  dial ranged  from 0.3 to 4.0%.

The variation  in ration  composition  on the 10 farms  is summarised  in Table  
4. Grass  silage  was used on all farms  but the level of inclusion  in the ration  
ranged  from  202 to 579 g/kg  DM. In addition,  the DM digestibility  of the silage,  
and therefore  its feeding  value,  was variable  (range  680 to 780 g/kg,  mean  740,  
coefficient  of variation  5.5%).  Eight  of the farms  used  fodder  beet  and one farm  
used sugar  beet.  A variety  of protein  and energy  sources  were  also used (Table
4). A price  was assigned  to the grass  silage,  based  on its DM digestibility,  using  
the cropcost  computer  program  (O’Kiely  et al., 1997).  Costs  were assigned  to 
the other  ingredients  based  on December  prices  on the Farmers  Journal.  Total  
feed costs ranged  from £0.86/kg  to £1.71/kg,  mean  £1.23/kg.

Measured  animal  performance  is summarised  in Table  5. There  was a wide  
range  in the weight  of cattle performance  on each farm, the growth  rate and 
feed  intake  achieved  and the cost  of animal  growth.  These  data  can be compared  
with  the Teagasc  budget  for a primarily grass  silage-based  winter  finishing  system  
described  in Table 1.
As outlined  in the introduction,  profitability  in an individual  beef  production  
system  is influenced  not only by technical  performance,  but also by buying/  
selling  prices,  negotiated  prices  of ingredients,  etc. To examine  the impact  of

Food and Forestry  -weekly  price reporting  - October  1997)
* carcass  value was £ 1.85/kg
* ration  costs were standardised  as described  above
Calculated  gross  margin/animal,  excluding  premia,  ranged  from  A to B (£) mean,

Summary  and Conclusions
* Of the 10 farms  chosen  for this study,  all were specialised  winter  finishers  
located  in Leinster,  all used  feeder  wagons,  all used  grass  silage  as the basal  
forage  and most used beet (mainly  fodder  beet).  How representative  these  
systems  of production  are of the winter  feeding  sector  remains  to be 
determined.
* Diverse  strategies  were used on the 10 farms,  i.e. purchase  weight  of the 
cattle,  finishing  period,  ration  composition,  housing,  etc.
* Considerable  variation  in feed intake  and animal  growth  was observed  
between  farms.  Average  animal  performance  on individual  farms  was not 
better  than would  be typically  recorded  in a research  environment.
* There  is scope  on many of the farms  to improve  technical  performance.
* Profitability  on an individual  farm varied  considerably.

Introduction
The return  from  finishing  cattle  in Ireland  and in particular  winter  finishing,  
as a consequence  of the B.S.E.  crisis  and changes  in E.U. market  supports  has, 
as we all know,  reached  an all time low. This price  crash  occurred  in the other  
major  European  beef  producing  and importing  countries  as well. However  as 
a result  of a policy  of “nationalisation ” within  these European  markets,  beef  
prices  have been restored  to near pre-B.S.E.  levels.  Unfortunately  this is not 
the case with Irish beef prices.  The further  decline  in buying  power  of third  
country  markets  and the virtual  closure  of the Russian  market,  leave  the Irish  
Beef  Industry  at a major  cross roads.  One option  is to continue  to depend  on 
live shipping  of cattle  or to erratically  produce  commodity  type beef  for third  
country  markets.
The other  option  is to focus  on high  value  markets  on the continent.  We need  
to set about  replicating  some  of the continental  production  systems,  as we have  
a limited  number  of cattle  currently  suitable  to meet  these  continental  market  
requirements.  We have to look at our breeding  policy  and clearly  focus on 
producing  the correct  specification  cattle for these markets.  The current  
production  system  of finishing  top quality  continental  cross animals  at 3 years  
plus, which  are not suitable  for any of the premium  priced  markets  in Europe,  
cannot  continue.
The need to breed  for and correctly  feed the required  type of cattle  to meet  
the strict  market  requirements  in these  deficit  European  markets  is essential  for 
the survival  of the Irish Beef Industry.  The continued  production  of the 
“traditional ” heavy  steer/heifer,  in particular,  over the winter  period  is grossly  
inefficient.  Feed  intakes  rarely  reach  the levels  that give a consistent  liveweight  
gain,  thus failing  to produce  carcase  gains  that give  an economic  return  on feeding  
cost. Generally  the margins  obtained  from these cattle are only the slaughter  
premium.
Irish  beef  farmers  must  set in place  a strategy  to supply  the correct  specification  
animals  which  are produced  in a profitable  production  system.  The essential  
elements  of this system  are that it will promote  the most  efficient  use of feeds,  
will control  costs,  particularly  those of variable  cost inputs  such as feed, and 
will make  the most  efficient  use of the potential  of beef  cattle  across  all breeds.
The specification  of the cattle  required  (finished  weight, carcase  conformation  
and fat colour)  cannot  be met from  an extensive  grazing  production  system  alone.  
There  is a need to supplement  with quality  energy  and protein  feeds. This  
requirement  can be met from the use of quality  farm-grown  feeds,  that for the 
most  part can be produced  in Ireland,  for example,  cereals,  root crops,  oilseeds  
and pulses.
91
An essential  requirement  in producing  cattle  for such European  markets  is 
that the farmer  is not alone.  The system  needs to be operated  in partnership  
with export  licensed  meat  processing  plants  which  market  the beef  produced.  
This in turn will lead to a situation  where  regular  supply  contracts  can be set 
up between  the farmer  and the processor  for a market  led production  system.
The Keenan  System
The Keenan  Total Mixed  Ration  System  is based  on the simple  principals  
of feeding  a nutritionally  balanced  ration  (i.e. for energy,  protein,  both  quickly  
and slowly  degradable,  fibre,  minerals  and vitamins)  which  is available  to the 
cattle  on a 24 hour  basis.  This  ration  must  be mixed  and presented  to the cattle  
in a form that encourages  intake  and maintains  the ration  structure  (ration  
structure  being an essential  element  in promoting  rumen  health  and general  
animal  health  and performance).
This system when correctly  implemented  on farm will result in the 
following:-
1) Healthy  and contented  animals
2) Consistent  steady  intake
3) Good liveweight  gains
4) Reduced  days on feed
5) Very good feed efficiency
6) Better  carcase  kill-out
7) Possibility  to manipulate  earcase  characteristics
8) More  profitable  production  - lower  cost
Richard  Keenan  & Co. have,  over  the years  with  the help  of our large  customer  
base both in Ireland  and around  the world,  endeavoured  to develop  more  
profitable  beef  production  systems.  These  production  systems  have  always  had 
to take into account  the following:-
1. Type of cattle being finished  - potential  for intake  and weight  gain
2. Feeds  available
3. Quality  of forages  available
4. Relative  value  of purchased  feeds
5. Market  outlets  for beef
1. IVpe of cattle  being  finished  - Intake  and liveweight  gain potential
There are large differences  in terms of liveweight  gain, feed conversion  
efficiency  and suitability  for certain  markets  between  the various  breeds  of cattle  
available  to the farmer.  For example, when  feeding  Holstein steers  the aim should  
be to meet  their appetite  requirements  by feeding  a lower  overall  energy  in the 
ration.  High forage  inclusion  in the ration  is the assured  way of meeting  their  
requirements.  Continental  cross  cattle  with a great  potential  for liveweight  gain 
and carcase  gain should  be fed high energy  rations  achieving  high intakes  to 
reach their full genetic  potential.  See Appendix  1 for Keenan  Beef Ration  
Specification
92
2. Feeds  available
Winter  feed  planning  and budgeting  are an essential  part of a winter  finishing  
programme.  The types  of feeds  to be purchased  should  be examined  in terms  
of;-
1. Consistency  of supply
2. Quality/native  cereals  essential
3. Price
4. Storage  facilities  and storage  requirements
3. Quality  of forages  available
Quality  forages,  when included  in a T.M.R.,  have a substantial  effect  on 
lowering  the cost of the overall  ration  and in the  performance  of the cattle  being  
fed. A 60:40  ration  of forage  to concentrates  on an ad lib basis is probably  in 
most cases the most cost effective.  The inclusion  of a second  forage  always  
has a beneficial  effect  on the  ration.  Generally,  if the following  forages  are used  
intakes  will increase  and also performance;
1. Fodder/sugarbeet
2. Potatoes
3. Maize  silage
4. Whole  crop
5. Brewers  grains
4. Relative  value  of purchased  feeds
Relative  values  of feeds  must be reviewed  before  any feeding  programme  
can be implemented.  Relative  protein  and energy  values  need to be examined,  
in order  to fully evaluate  a feed being  considered.  See Appendix  2 for relative  
feed values.
5. Market  outlets  for beef
There  is a requirement  in the market  place  for younger  leaner  cattle  which  
can be supplied  on a consistent  basis.  The winter  feeding  programmes  developed  
by Keenan  are an essential  part of an overall  production  blueprint  which  needs  
to be implemented  in order to meet the specifications  for high value export  
markets  that before  now have not been met by Irish cattle.
The feeders  and producers  of cattle for these markets  need to:-
1. Have a planned  focused  breeding  policy
2. Proper  weanling  management
3. Improve  grazing  management
4. Produce  quality  forages
5. Feed to maximise  cattle  potential
6. Feed quality  ingredients
Beef  production  - The Future
Sustaining  a rewarding  margin  in winter  beef  production  in recent  years  has 
been  difficult. Present  market  outlets  particularly  to third  countries  are in turmoil.  
The continued  high prices  being  paid in marts  for quality  finished  stores  and
93
weanlings  leaves  the specialist  winter  finisher  with the difficulty  of how to 
return  a margin  from his enterprise.
Based  on the Australian  model  of “partnership  and alliances ”, whereby  co­
operation  between  all strands  of the industry  results  in reduction  of waste  and 
the production  of cattle to a tight specification  to meet high value market  
requirements,  Keenan  and Kepak  have recently  launched  the Keenan-Kepak  
Beef  Club.
The advantage  of this production  scheme  for the Keenan  customer  are;
1. Keenan  co-ordinated  efficient  production  system
2. Assured  all year round  market  for quality  fed stock
3. Guaranteed  premium  price
Keenan-Kepak  Beef  Alliance
The purpose  of the club is that Keenan  Beef  Customers,  through  a tightly  
co-ordinated  supply  group,  will supply  young  bulls and heifers  to the 
Mediterranean  market  on a fifty two week  of the year basis.  The club can be 
summarised  as follows:
1. Keenan  customers  exclusively  supplying  young  bulls and  heifers  all year 
round  to Kepak
2. Beef sold into high value continental  niche markets
3. Feeding  regime,  controlled  by Keenan  Nutrition  is based  on quality  feeds.
4. Keenan  co-ordinate  the production  and supply  of stock
5. Detailed  analysis  of slaughter  information  centralised  by Keenan  to 
further  enhance  the production  system.
Using  commonly  available  forages  and cereals  produced  on farm  and selected  
protein  balancers  both steers  and heifers  will be finished  to ensure  a white  fat 
colour.  It is also necessary  to have an even cover  of fat over the carcase,  4L 
and 4H is ideal. The colour  of the meat  also is very specific  - a light  pink  colour.  
When  all these  characteristics  are met then  the conformation  of the animal  needs  
to be of a high order  to meet the required  specification.  The animals  are sold 
into the Mediterranean  market  as full carcasses,  so poor conformation  or fat 
cover  cannot  be hidden.  The appropriate  breeding,  feeding  and management  
system  is essential  to ensure  the orderly  production  of these  high value  cattle.  
The age restriction  on both heifers  and bulls of 16 months  when slaughtered  
will easily  be met if the Keenan  production  blueprint  is followed.  The Keenan  
Blueprint  comprises  the following  areas.
1. Breeding
A structured  policy  whereby  proper  half to three-quarter  breed  continental  
cross animals  are produced  using the top A.I. or stock bulls available.  The 
possible  splitting  of the herd  between  autumn  and spring  calving  will: (a) reduce  
the work load during  busy calving  periods  and, (b) spread  the age profile  of 
cattle to allow flexibility  when selling.
Cattle  that are purchased  for this market  must  be from  sources  which  ensure  
finishing  to the proper  specification.
94
2. Management
A steady  growth  pattern  is essential  so as to avoid  a store period  in these  
cattle (see Appendix  3 for possible  systems  of production).
3. Feed
Grassland  management  and forage  production  must to be of the highest  
stardards  in order  to:
1. Maximise  animal  growth  potential
2. Reduce  costs
3. Enhance  carcase  characteristics
Young  bulls post-weaning  require  a planned  growth  phase  particularly  if 
they are housed.  The use of straw and high quality  proteins  to supplement  
available  forages  will ensure  that when  the finishing  phase  of the production  
is implemented  the cattle will:
1. Have  sufficient  frame  to carry  the overall  carcase  weight  required  within  
the age restriction.
2. Be able to respond  to the high  starch  and high  sugar  ration  that will ensure  
the colour  of the meat and fat cover.
Conclusion
Opportunities  for the beef farmer  are:
1. Availability  of cheaper  feeds.
2. Cattle  finished  at younger  ages
3. Cattle  produced  to meet specific  market  requirements
4. Development  of meaningful  partnerships  and alliances
5. Closer  farmer  to farmer  co-operation  in cattle supply  and feed supply.  
The above  opportunities  have all been addressed  by the Keenan  Company.
We have  a large  base  of customers  who are closely  following  Keenan  Nutrition  
guidelines  in conjunction  with using  a Keenan  Feeder,  and are producing  cattle  
to meet market  requirements.  These  Keenan  customers  are seeing  improved  
margins  from their beef enterprises.

control  of lameness  are discussed  in this paper.  Footrot  is the most  economically  
significant  cause  of lameness  in Irish sheep  and particular  discussion  will be 
devoted  to that disease.
Footrot
Risk factors
Good  husbandry  of sheep  is synonymous  with good welfare.  Footrot  is a 
common,  injfectious  condition  which  has long been  associated  with  the welfare  
of sheep.  Over  50% of lowland  lambs  can be lame  with footrot  if the weather  
and pasture  conditions  are suitable.  Breed  susceptibility  is a well-known  feature  
and Down  breeds,  in particular  the Suffolk,  are more  susceptible  than  crossbred  
sheep.  Most  hill breeds  are less susceptible  while  the Merino  breed  is notoriously  
susceptible.  The prevalence  of footrot  in hill sheep  is generally  low. Footrot  
prevalence  varies  with rainfall  and temperature  and also on the concentration  
of sheeps ’ feet on pasture  (stocking  density).  Prevalence  is highest  in warm,  
wet weather  when  there  are many  ewes  and lambs  together  i.e. lowland  flocks  
in the spring  and autumn.  Sheep  with footrot  suffer  chronic  pain, they have  
reduced  liveweight  gain (equivalent  to a loss of 0.5kg/week  in the fattening  
lamb)  and reduced  wool  growth. Importantly,  ewes  with  footrot  in late pregnancy  
are more  likely  to develop  twin  lamb  disease. Despite  the availability  of a number  
of treatments,  footrot  remains  a significant  problem  and it also represents  a 
significant  animal  welfare  issue. Welfare  issues  are prominent  in the public  
domain  and the day may soon arrive  when marketability  of lamb or the 
application  of headage  payments  may partially  depend  on appropriate  attention  
to prevention  of lameness  on sheep  farms
The causative  organisms
Footrot  is caused  by the dual infection  of Fusobacterium  necrophorum  and 
Dichelobacter  nodosus.  Fusobacterium  is found  in the environment,  has many  
hosts  and represents  an ever-present  risk. Ten different  strains  of Dichelobacter  
have  been  recognised  and individual  flocks  are usually  affected  by two or more  
of these  serotypes.  Carrier  sheep  acting  as reservoirs  of infection  are the most  
significant  means  of transmission.  These  carrier  sheep  are often  recovered  cases  
or sheep  with low grade  chronic  foot rot. Dichelobacter  is confined  to the feet 
and can survive  for only short  periods  (up to 2 weeks)  on the ground.  It can 
also be earned  by cattle,  deer  and possibly  horses.  Both  bacteria  require  warmth  
and moisture,  both are anaerobic  i.e. they thrive  in tissue  unexposed  to the air, 
and both are sensitive  to chemicals.
97
The disease
Two clinical  forms  of footrot  have been described.  These  are virulent  or 
“classical ” footrot  and benign  or non-progressive  footrot. Virulent  footrot  begins  
between  the cleats  with the production  of red, foul-smelling  material  and leads  
to separation  of the horn from heel to toe. This results  in severe  lameness,  loss 
in thrive  and the characteristic  “praying  posture ”. In benign  footrot  there is 
slight heel separation  only.
The theory  of control  of footrot
The principles  of control  of foot rot are based  on factors  associated  with  
the bacteria,  host factors  associated  with the sheep  and factors  associated  with  
the environment.
1. Bacterial  factors.  Control  is based on reducing  the level of bacterial  
challenge  by foot-paring,  footbaths,  antibiotics,  vaccination,  segregation  and 
culling.  The use of clean  pasture/premises  {Helicobacter  survives  a maximum  
of 2 weeks  outside  host) is a very important  principle  in this context.
2. Host factors.  Emphasis  is placed  on increasing  flock resistance  by 
vaccination,  selective  breeding.
3. Environmental  factors.  Provision  of adequate  dry, bedding  at housing  
is important.  Land  drainage  may need  consideration.  Housed  sheep  are at risk 
if the bedding  is not kept  clean  and dry. Sheep  outdoors  are at risk during  warm,  
moist  weather  when  footrot  and scald  are readily  transmitted  through  the flock.
Prevention  of footrot
The methods  available  for prevention  and treatment  of footrot  include  
footparing,  footbathing  with 3% formalin,  or 10% zinc sulphate,  antibiotic  
therapy  and vaccination.
Footparing
Reluctance  to handle  and pare pregnant,  housed  ewes is associated  with a 
fear that the handling  may precipitate  abortion.  However,  pregnant  ewes can 
be examined  and treated  successfully  by, either,  lifting  the leg with the ewe 
restrained  standing  against  a wall,  or carefully  putting  the ewe on her side using  
the “neck flexed  back on flank ” technique  to examine  the foot. For sheep  at 
other  times  of the year,  the use of a cradle  which  enables  the sheep  to be turned  
and dealt with without  bending  is a great benefit.
A good pair of fpot-clippers  and a sharp  penknife  are all that are required.  
The foot and claw should  be cleaned  of any mud  or manure,  and any obviously  
loose horn trimmed  away. Sheep  may also be walked  through  a water  bath.  
Trimming  should  be radical  to remove  all loose.and  dead horn but should  not 
be excessive.  In particular,  care must be taken not to cut too deeply  near the 
toe. Trimming  too hard  back  leading  to excessive  bleeding  at the toe is a common  
fault  and may lead  to the development  of “toe fibroma ” which  never  heal without  
radical  treatment.  Paring  should  be sufficient  to tidy up the foot to allow  air 
access  to the deeper  tissues  (N.B. the bacteria  are anaerobic)  and allow  
penetration  of footbath  chemicals.
Footbaths
Footbathing  is a traditional  method  for treatment  and control  of footrot.  When
98
earned  out effectively  it is a very valuable  technique.  The traditional  footbaths  
used are Formalin  3%, Zinc sulphate  10%, (Stand-in  time 2-10 minutes).  The 
use of footbaths  should  be preceded  by paring  and followed  by drying  on hard  
surface  for one hour. The penetration  of Zinc sulphate  may be enhanced  by 
using  a penetrating  agent  such as sodium  lauryl  sulphate.  This requires  a long  
stand-in  time (30-60  minutes)  for full benefit  so a large foot bath is required  
for many  sheep.  This penetrating  agent  also prevents  blood  clotting  so bleeding  
should  be minimal  when  paring.  Foaming  may prevent  the sheep  from  entering  
the bath.
Antibiotics
The judicious  use of antibiotics  topically  (aerosol)  and parenterally  (by 
intramuscular  injection)  has an important  role in the treatment  of acute  cases  
of footrot  in the context  of an overall  control  programme.
Vaccines
There  are 10 different  strains  of helicobacter.  The vaccine  can be used in 
face of outbreak.  Avoid  vaccinating  ewes between  4 weeks  prior  and 4 weeks  
after  lambing.  Lambs  can be vaccinated  at 4 weeks  of age. There  may be severe  
local reactions  at the site of injection  and duration  of immunity  is relatively  
short-lived  at approximately  12 weeks.
Why does footrot  continue  to be such a problem?
The primary  reasons  for failure  of prevention  programmes  may include  
haphazard  attempts  at control  in association  with inefficient  paring,  inadequate  
footbathing  and/or  antibiotic  therapy.
Timing  of treatment  is important
Australian  research  has illustrated  that any treatment  is less effective  if it 
is applied  when  the disease  is actively spreading  through  the flock. It is important  
therefore  to treat at time of the year when  the disease  is not active  and ideally  
to target the treatment  prior to an expected  period  of disease  transmission.  
Treatment  is less effective  if applied  during  the period  of disease  spread.  Using  
this information,  a “Blitz Tactical  Treatment ” regime  has been studied  at the 
Moredun  Research  Centre  in Scotland.  Treatment  was applied  prior to an 
identified  period  of risk, in this case,  at housing  before  lambing.  All sheep  were  
footbathed  for two minutes  in 10% zinc sulphate.  All sheep  with affected  feet 
were pared and received  an intramuscular  injection  of combined  penicillin-  
streptomycin.  A second  treatment  group  received  the same  treatments  plus footrot  
vaccination.  A further  group  of untreated  animal  was monitored  as controls.
A treatment  programme  based  on this Moredun  trial with blitz treatment  
once or twice  a year should  reduce  the prevalence  of the infection  within  the 
flock  to a level  at which  disease  spread  does not occur,  even  at times  favorable  
for transmission.  This type of programme  would  greatly  reduce  the time and 
money  spent  continually  treating  individually  affected  sheep  during  outbreaks  
of footrot, provide  a more  efficient  use of resources  and improve  both  the welfare  
and productivity  of the animal  itself.
99
Eradication  of footrot  Is it a feasible  option?
Vast  areas  of New  South  Wales  in Australia  are now footrot  free.  Eradication  
requires  time,  commitment  and complete  dedication.  It may not be feasible  for 
many  farmers.  An eradication  programme  should  begin  when  the disease  is not  
actively  spreading.  All feet need to be examined.  Those  sheep  that are normal  
are designated  to a ‘clean ’ main flock. Those  with footrot  are designated  to 
a “hospital ” flock.  The sheep  in the clean  flock  are separated  from  the hospital  
flock,  footbathed  and moved  to clean grazing  (a pasture  that has not carried  
sheep  seven days).
The sheep in the hospital  group have their feet pared,  are treated  with  
antibiotics  and footbathed  or treated  topically  with  oxytetracycline  spray.  These  
sheep  are then moved  to a separate  clean  pasture.  They  are re-examined  5 days  
later, retreated  where  necessary  and re-footbathed  before  being removed  to 
another  clean  paddock.  At 10 days  the main  clean  flock  is gathered  re-footbathed,  
any infected  sheep  transferred  to the hospital  flock and the remainder  of the 
flock then moved  to a further  clean grazing.
At this time the hospital  group  is re-gathered  and inspected  and any cured  
and sound  sheep are transferred  to the main flock. The remainder  are re- 
footbathed  and returned  to either  the same  pasture  or preferably  clean  pasture.  
Ten days later,  the clean  group  are re-inspected  and re-footbathed.  The hospital  
group is examined  and all sound  sheep are added  to the clean flock. The 
remaining  sheep which  have not recovered  or still show lesions  are culled.  
Culling  of chronically  infected  sheep is the key to the eradication  of 
footrot.
Vaccination  can be assisted  in an eradication  programme,  all sheep  being  
vaccinated  at the time of the first gather.  Such vaccination  will often shorten  
the time required  to cure the hospital  flock and on occasions  if a severe  
culling policy is to be adopted  the whole operation  can be finalised  
in 154 days.
Recent  reports  of “severe  footrot ” in sheep
The year 1997 was a particularly  bad year for foot rot, particularly  in the 
period  August  to September.  The meteorological  conditions  for those  months  
in 1997,  warm,  wet weather  were  ideal for the spread  of footrot.  Two bacteria  
{F. necrophorum  and spirochaetes)  associated  with severe  footrot  in cattle  
“superfoul ” were  isolated  from  sheep  in these  severe  virulent  cases.  The affected  
sheep  were from farms  where  cattle and sheep  were held together  and where  
there was a history of Mortellaro  in the cattle. Few of the flock were  
vaccinated.
Foot scald
Foot scald is a superficial  inflammation  of the skin between  the cleats  and 
is caused  by Fusobacterium  necrophorum.  Scald sometimes  occurs  as an 
outbreak  in young  lambs  grazing  on wet, warm  or sometimes  icy pasture  causing  
substantial  lameness.  It can also be a significant  problem  in housed  sheep.  It 
can be controlled  using  footbathing  and or the topical  use of antibiotics;  paring  
and vaccination  have no role to play in the prevention  of foot scald.
100
White  line disease
Separation  of horn  from  sensitive  laminae.  The white  line becomes  impacted  
with dirt particularly  towards  the toe. Responds  well to paring.
Foot abscess
Usually  affects  only one foot. A severe  lameness  which  is associated  with  
penetration  of the foot by a foreign  body. The joint inside  the claw becomes  
infected.  Pus fistulates  out above  the coronary  band.  This may be a problem  
on stubble  fields and may require  culling  or surgical  amputation.
Joint  ill in lambs
Joint ill is an infectious  arthritis.  In young  lambs  infection  usually  gains  
entry via the navel.  In tick areas,  concurrent  tick-borne  infections  predispose  
lambs  to this disease.  Joint  ill in younger  lambs  is caused  by E. coli  and erysipelas  
infection.  Control  depends  on hygiene  in the lambing  area and navel  treatment  
with tincture  of iodine.  The incorporation  of the erysipelas  vaccine  may be 
worthwhile  in flocks  where  the significance  of that  disease  has been  established.  
However,  severe  problems  have occurred  in flocks  where  hygiene  is excellent  
and other  organisms  other  than the ones mentioned  e.g. Streptococci  may be 
involved  in those  cases.  Erysipelas  generally  affects  lambs  greater  than  2 months  
of age. It is associated  with  docking  and castration  and may  be a problem  where  
pig slurry  has been spread  on pasture.
Post-dipping  lameness
Caused  by eryspipelas  and associated  with use of Organophosphate  dips.  
The older phenolic  dips were bacteriostatic.  A sudden  outbreak  of severe  
lameness  may occur  2-5 days after dipping.  Up to 80% of the flock may be 
affected.  It mainly  affects  the forelegs,  the feet may be hot and the skin above  
coronary  band  swollen.  Control  is based  on reducing  soil contamination  of the 
dipper  and the use of dip bacteriostats  such  as zinc sulphate  at 1:1000.  Vaccination  
may be an option  in flocks  where  it is a particularly  severe  problem
Vitamin  E/Se deficiency  myopathy
Risk factors  include  selenium  deficient  pastures.  Vitamin  E deficient  diets  
such as weathered  hays,  moist  or preserved  grains,  root crops.  Lameness  may 
be seen in older  lambs  (3-6 months)  and there may be also be ill thrift, with  
generalised  stiffness,  trembling  and exercise  intolerance.  Treatment  is based  
upon the use of injectable  Se-vitamin  E preparations.  Ewes  can be treated  in 
late pregnancy  and neonatal  lambs  can be treated  with the injections  repeated  
at three months  of age.
Osteochondrosis
This is a degenerative  change  in articular  and growth  plate  cartilage  and is 
associated  with  rapid  growth,  particularly  in pedigree  ram lambs,  at 5-8 months.  
There  is no consistent  evidence  of genetic  heritabilty.  Dietary  factors  such as 
high calcium  diet to ewes  may also have a role. Intermittent  chronic  lameness  
involving  the shoulder,  elbow  and hock  joints  is produced.  There  is little or 
no heat or swelling  of the joints.

Putting  Profit  Back  Into Sheep  Farming
J. E. VIPOND
Scottish  Agricultural  College,  Animal  Biology  Division,  Bush Estate,  
Penicuik,  Midlothian  EH26  OPH, Scotland.
A severe  downturn  in the financial  viability  of UK sheep  farming  occurred  
in 1998.  Contributing  factors  include  a 30%  reduction  in lamb  and hogget  values  
from  a year ago. Finished  lamb  prices  fell during  the third  quarter  of 1997 and 
again  in the third  quarter  of 1998.  Breeding  ewe values  have also fallen  in the 
UK by up to 50% of the previous  year ’s value and cull ewes are down £15 
per head, a similar  percentage  reduction.
Other  changes  in the economic  background  include  increases  over  the year 
in labour  costs  of around  7% but a fall in cereal  prices  to around  £70 per tonne  
(11%  reduction  on the year).  However,  currently  there  are high  prices  for forage  
and straw and the unit cost of energy  is currently  lower  in concentrates  than 
in forage  which  is an exceptional  circumstance.
While  some  of these  fluctuations  in prices  may be short  term,  in the medium  
term the outlook  is for continuing  pressure  on profitability  owing  to a strong  
currency,  increased  competition  through  the reduction  in tariff  barriers  owing  
to the GATT  agreements  and in particular  competition  from  New  Zealand  chilled  
lamb which  is directly  competing  with fresh home produced  hogget  during  
January  to June.  Lamb  is currently  positioned  in the market  in the luxury  sector  
along  with the better  cuts of beef. However,  over the long term,  reductions  in 
beef  prices  resulting  from low cereal  prices  and the cessation  of slaughtering  
of bull calves  under  the BSE compensation  scheme  will occur.
There  is therefore  an urgent  need to address  the relevant  technical  issues  
for reducing  the costs of lamb production.  This paper  draws  on experience  of 
New Zealand  farming  techniques  seen as a result  of a Stapledon  Fellowship.
Are we using  the right breeds  and genetic  improvement  techniques?
UK sheep  breeding  has concentrated  on carcase  traits. However,  in NZ 
farmers  can also select  on EBVs  for wool  production  and resistance  to worms.  
With  wool  prices  depressed  there  is little  interest  currently  in improving  quality  
or yield but resistance  to parasites  and ‘easy care ’ attributes  are of interest.  In 
New  Zealand  research  workers  (McEwan  etai, 1997;  Morris  etai,  1998)  have  
concentrated  on achieving  a low flock  faecal  worm  egg count.  Their  research  
programme  started  with an estimation  of the heritability  of this trait (0.23)  and 
its correlation  with production  traits. Unfortunately,  challenged  lambs  with a 
low egg count  tend to be more daggy  and have lower  fleece  weight.  There  
followed  development  of an overall  production  and disease  resistance  index  
with its application  to the industry.  In addition  a blood  test based  on nematode  
antibodies  (marketed  by AgVax  as the Blood  Antibody  Host Resistance  Test)  
has been developed.  Despite  the negative  correlations  over 50 farmers  are 
actively  using the selection  indices  in New Zealand.
102
Results  have  been  favourable.  Those  farmers  operating  the selection  process  
for the longest  (10 years)  demonstrated  significant  reductions  in worm  egg output  
from  ewes  and lambs  with improved  wool  production  and higher  growth  rates.  
Genetic  links are made  by rotating  rams between  farms.  Currently  30 flocks  
are involved  in 3 separate  sire referencing  schemes,  as well  as some  20 unlinked  
flocks.  In 1997 more  than 7000 two tooth  and older  rams retained  for sale or 
use within  the reference  flocks  were  ranked  on the index  in these  three  schemes.  
BLUP  repeated  trait animal  model  analysis  is used to remove  environmental  
effects  between  farms,  years  and sexes.  No evidence  for problems  of genotype  
X environment  interactions  has been reported.
The benefits  to production  mainly  come from reduced  levels of pasture  
contamination  and challenge  owing  to lower  faecal  egg output.  Around  10% 
of recorded  sires  were  sold  in 1995  with  information  on their  resistance  to worms,  
seen as valuable  to commercial  farmers  buying  rams.  The high uptake  of the 
work  which  was carried  out at AgResearch,  Invermay  has been  due to the close  
contact  between  researchers  and farmers  in the development  of the selection  
programme.
Work is ongoing  in NZ to identify  markers  for the genes  responsible  for 
parasite  resistance  (Crawford  et al, 1997).  Major  genes  are also known  to operate  
in UK breeds,  e.g. the Blackface,-conferring  resistance  to worms  (Schwaiger  
et al., 1998).  Thus  it may not be necessary  to import  sheep  to gain the genetic  
benefits  in the future.
Many  New Zealand  farmers  have practiced  rigorous  culling  to eliminate  
problems  such  as lambing  difficulty,  mismothering  and metabolic  disorders  with  
rapid  reductions  in the incidence  of these  time-consuming  problems.  Farmers  
also  practice  lambing  methods  that respect  natural  sheep  behaviour,  minimising  
disturbance  and achieving  better  bonding  between  ewes and lambs,  resulting  
in less mismothering  (Geenty,  1997).  This  has allowed  an increase  in the typical  
number  of sheep per farm from 2,200 in 1981 to 3,300 in 1998 without  
compromising  health/welfare.
Can we make  more  use of grassland?
Should  the sheep industry  adapt  New Zealand  inspired  extended  grazing  
seasons,  feed wedges  and control  systems  based  on DM/ha  as leading  farmers  
in the dairy industry  have?  In practice,  few NZ sheep  farmers  use DM/ha  for 
management  decisions.  Most rely on sward  height  for day to day decisions  
about  moving  stock  and pasture  control.  Estimates  of DM/ha  are mainly  used  
in all grass wintering  systems  typically  involving  100 paddocks  and daily  shifts.  
These  are operated  from  the post-mating  period  to late pregnancy  to ration  grass  
and build  up pasture  cover,  often  involving  groups  of over 1,000  ewes  (Geenty,  
1994).  Scaling  this down to our flock sizes would  increase  fencing  costs.  
Questions  arise about  the ability  of our soil types to withstand  such stocking  
pressures  and in wet weather  welfare  could be compromised.
One element  of this system  that has immediate  application  is the use of grass  
to provide  late pregnancy  nutrition.  This has already  been incorporated  into 
May  lambing  systems  (Vipond  and Mitchell,  1996).  May  lambing  systems  have
103
effectively  cut feed costs in recent  years but cheaper  concentrates  and lower  
finished  prices  for lambs  have  reduced  their  attractiveness  and those  practising  
May  lambing  currently  justify  it on reduced  fixed  costs  (mainly  labour). Current  
New Zealand  technologies  worth  exploring  in pasture  based  systems  include  
seedhead  and weed  suppression  in pastures  using  ultra-low  glyphosate  treatment  
and on-farm  monitoring  of faecal  egg counts  (nematode  worms).  This  can reduce  
reliance  on anthelmintic  usage to control  worms  and delay development  of 
anthelmintic  resistance.
The way forward  - current  systems
Current  lowland  systems  are characterised  by an overemphasis  on breeding  
objectives  towards  meat characteristics  - growth  rate and conformation  - in 
relation  to what the market  is currently  paying  for these traits. Where  these  
developments  increase  the labour  element  of keeping  sheep,  e.g. extreme  
conformation  associated  with lambing  difficulty  or increased  cost caused  by 
lack of milk in ewes and the need for supplementary  colostrum,  then we are 
locked  into an unprofitable  business.  Tinkering  with  such  a basically  unprofitable  
system  is not likely  to put it back into profitability.  Major  cutbacks  in inputs  
of feeds  or medicines  can quickly  become  counterproductive.  Useful  savings  
can be made  however  by monitoring  for diseases,  trace element  deficiencies  
and underfeeding,  knowing  the value of feeds and efficacies  of supplements  
and medicines  and making  the appropriate  inputs  on the basis  of this information  
and knowledge  of requirements.
New systems
We could  take a useful  lead from the dairy industry  and look at how we 
measure  economic  success  by throwing  out gross  margin  analysis  which  ignores  
fixed costs and looking  at total costs of production  in pence  per kg of lamb  
sold. We need also new indicators  of efficiency.  Biological  expressions  such  
as kg DM fed per ewe wintered  could be borrowed  from New Zealand  and 
modified  to our subsidised  systems.  Indicators  that are currently  more  relevant  
include  identification  of those  costs  critical  to ensure  annual  headage  payment.  
Dry sheep  farming  in remote  hill areas may be the most profitable  option  at 
current  low lamb and cast ewe values.  Most farmers  will be uncomfortable  
with such developments.  However,  they reduce  the power  of the large-scale  
multiples  who have become  beneficiaries  of subsidised  agriculture  because  
farmers  provide  them  with products  at less than the cost of production  through  
the subsidies  they receive.
The details  of profitable  new sheep  farming  systems  are not clear  but their  
elements  can be identified.  These  include  higher  product  prices  based  on:
• Costs of production.
• Selling  lambs  under  the EU initiative  for Protected  Designations  of Origin  
and Protected  Geographical  Indication.
• Farm assurance  and organic  premiums.
• Group  marketing  schemes  on a regional  basis.*
• Use of sheep  with  genetic  and behavioural  characteristics  that reduce  labour  
input.
104
• More  use of grass  as a feed, reduced  inputs  of animal  medicines,  supplements  
and labour.
• Re-direction  of the focus in sheep farming  towards  providing  the 
environmental  and social  benefits  derived  from keeping  sheep.
The challenge  is to achieve  these objectives  without  a major  reduction  in
the rural population.

The Effect  of Genotype  and Feeding  
System  on the Performance  of Holstein  
Friesian  Cows at Pasture
F. BUCKLEY  and P. DILLON  
Teagasc,  Moorepark  Research  Centre,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
The rate of genetic  improvement  in Ireland  up until the mid-80 ’s was low 
(approx.  0.5% per year) compared  to North  America  where  genetic  merit  for 
milk production  was increasing  by 1.5%  per year (Funk,  1993).  Since 1985 the 
rate of genetic  improvement  increased  markedly  to about  1.5%  per year  in 1992  
(Coffey,  1992).  This high rate of genetic  progress  has mostly  been achieved  
through  the importation  of North  American  and European  genetics.  The relative  
merit  of these sires has been obtained  from the performance  of their progeny  
in systems of milk  production  which  differ  greatly  from  those  operated  in Ireland.
The term “high  genetic  index ” (HGI)  in this paper  is used to describe  a cow,  
which  as a result  of selection,  is generally  predisposed  to produce  significantly  
more milk than a cow of lower  merit  status.  Studies  from New Zealand  have  
shown  that cows of high ‘genetic  index ’ at pasture,  produce  more  milk (20 to 
40%),  consume  more herbage  (5 to 20%),  were more efficient  convertors  of 
food into milk (10 to 15%) than lower  merit  cows (Holmes,  1988).  However,  
these ‘high ’ genetic  index  cows  would  be considered  ‘low ’ when  compared  to 
present-day  genetics.  Recent  results  from  Langhill  (Veerkamp  etal, 1994)  have  
shown  that increasing  genetic  index  results  in major  increases  in feed  efficiency,  
reflecting  increases  in milk yield with cows fed indoors  on silage/concentrate  
diets. There  is little information  available  on the performance  of present-day  
HGI dairy cows on seasonal  calving,  grass-based  systems  of milk production.
Implication  of increased  cow genetic  merit  (CGI)
Table 1 shows  how improved  management  and breeding  has contributed  to

Figure  1. Effect  of increased  milk production  on feed efficiency  
(Relative  ME requirement  in Mj for Maintenance  and Production)
increased  output  per cow and per hectare  since 1983 in controlled  full lactation  
experiments  at Moorepark.  ‘Moorepark  1983 ’ refers  to the performance  being  
achieved  at the introduction  of EU milk  quotas  in 1983.  ‘Moorepark  1996  MGF  
and ‘Moorepark  1996 HGF refer  to the performances  being  achieved  over  the 
last two years with cows with present-day  medium  genetic  index  (MGI)  and 
very high genetic  index  (HGI)  in similar  feeding  systems.  This has led to an 
increase  of 50% and 28% in milk yield per cow and per hectare,  respectively.  
It is not possible  to differentiate  precisely  how  much  of this increase  came  from  
genetic  improvement  and how much came from management  plus feeding.  
Figure  1 shows  the effect  of this increased  performance  on overall feed  efficiency.  
With  the Moorepark  cow of 1983,44%  of its total feed  requirement  was required  
for maintenance,  while with the HGI cows of 1996, only 36% of its feed 
requirement  was required  for maintenance.  This has resulted  in an increase  in 
feed efficiency  of 16%. There  is no evidence  that CGI has any influence  on 
partial  efficiency  of ME use for milk production  (Grainger  et ai, 1985).  
Therefore,  the extra  energy  requirement  for milk  yield  must  come  from  increased  
intake  and/or  greater  mobilisation  of body  reserves,  especially  in early  lactation.  
Recent  studies  have shown  (Veerkamp  et al., 1994)  that cows  of HGI produce  
significantly  higher  milk yield than cows of lower  genetic  index (LGI)  with 
only small  differences  in intake  of energy. A breeding  programme  based  solely  
on increased  milk yield and angularity  (or dairyness)  without  consideration  of 
feed intake  may result  in an animal  which  depends  on large mobilisation  of 
body tissue  in early lactation  (negative  energy  balance)  to support  high milk  
yields.  Such a breeding  programme  may not be suitable  in seasonal  spring ­
calving  systems  which  depend  to a large  extent  on grazed  grass  as a feed,  due 
to the possibility  of increases  in metabolic  disorders  and reduced  fertility  
performance.
Moorepark  comparison
In the autumn  of 1994,  two contrasting  genetic  groups  of in-calf  heifers  were  
assembled  at Moorepark.  The pedigree  index of the two groups  is shown  in 
Table  2. The pedigree  indices  of the HGI group  were 13 kg of fat and 14 kg 
of protein  higher  than the MGI  group.  It should  be noted  that average  RBI (95) 
for first lactation  animals  in 1995 nationally  was 104 (IDRC).

Three  different  feeding  systems  were compared  with each genotype.  The 
Moorepark  feeding  system  (System  A) incorporates  high stocking  rate (2.54  
cows/ha),  high nitrogen  input  (400 kg N/ha)  and a planned  concentrate  input  
of 500 kg/cow  (Dillon  et ai, 1995).  System  B had a similar  stocking  rate and 
nitrogen  input  to System  A, but twice  the level of concentrate.  System  C had 
a similar  level of concentrate  and nitrogen  to System  A but with unrestricted  
levels of high  quality  grass throughout  the year.  To maintain  system  C, achieving  
second-cut  silage  was not a priority.  The feeding  systems  were applied  from  
mid-April  to end of November.  A total of 48 HGI and 48 MGI animals  were  
used. Excess  grass was harvested  as wrapped  baled silage  to maintain  grass  
quality.  Grass was considered  to be in excess  when pre-grazing  yields  were  
>2000  kg DM/ha.  In 1996, a total of 3.2 ha in system  A, 3.8 ha in system  B, 
and 4.8 ha in system  C were harvested  in this manner.
Performance  in 1995
Tables  3 and 4 show  the average  performance  of the two genotypes  across  
the three  feeding  systems  (adjusted  for calving  date)  in 1995  and 1996.  In 1995,  
when all animals  were in their 1st lactation,  the HGI heifers  produced

significantly  more  milk  per cow (+945  kg) of a lower  fat content  (-0.31%)  and 
slightly  lower  protein  content  (-0.09%).  The yield of fat and protein  was 
significantly  higher  for the HGI  heifers.  The grass-growing  season  of 1995  was 
very erratic  with very poor growth  rates in the August/September  period  due 
to the large  moisture  deficit.  Concentrate  supplementation  therefore  was much  
higher  than planned.  The actual  concentrate  feeding  levels  were 863, 1449 and 
859 kg concentrates/cow  for the feeding  systems  A, B, and C, respectively.  
There  was no interaction  between  feeding  system  and CGI, i.e. both groups  
of heifers  responded  similarly  to each feeding  system.  The average  response  
to concentrate  feeding  was 0.80 kg milk/kg  of extra  concentrate  fed in feeding  
system  B.
Performance  in 1996
Table  4 shows  the milk production  for both genotypes  (averaged  across  the 
three feeding  systems).  In Figure  2, the milk production  profile  for both  
genotypes  is shown.

Figure  2. Effect  of cow genetic  index  on mean milk yield by week  of

The HGI cows  produced  significantly  higher  yields  of milk (+904  kg), fat 
(28 kg) and  protein  (29 kg) of slightly  lower  fat content  (-0,13)  and with  similar  
protein  content.  The average  daily  milk production  for the MGI  and HGI cows  
was 22.5 kg (4.8 gals) and 25.6 kg (5.5 gals) per cow over the lactation.  Peak  
milk production  was obtained  in early May at 35 kg/cow/day  (7.5 gals) and 
31 kg/cow/day  (6.6 gals) for the HGI and MGI cows,  respectively.  Lactation  
lengths  were similar  for both genotypes.
Tables  5, 6 and 7 show  the milk production  (adjusted  for calving  date) for 
both genotypes  on each feeding  system.  The concentrate  feeding  levels  were  
695, 1340 and 695 kg concentrate/cow  for feeding  systems  A, B and C, 
respectively,  over the entire lactation  in 1996. Concentrate  supplementation  
exceeded  the target  level in 1996 due to delayed  turnout  resulting  from poor  
grass  growth  rates.  Cows  were turned  out to pasture  by day on April 1 and by 
day and night  on April 10. There  was no interaction  between  CGI and feeding  
system,  although  the difference  in fat and protein  yield  between  genotype  was 
greatest  in feeding  system  B (+64 kg). The average  response  was 1.12 and 0.92  
kg milk/kg  extra  concentrate  fed for the HGI and MGI cows,  respectively,  of 
solids-corrected  milk.  The best responses  were obtained  in the autumn  period  
and the lowest  responses  were  recorded  in early  spring.  The milk  yield  response  
to feeding  system  C was 190 kg (41 gals)  of solids-corrected  milk  over  the total 
lactation.  The largest  responses  were again obtained  in the autumn  when  
supplemented  with  high  quality  grass  silage  while  the Moorepark  feeding  system  
were on grass-only.

Grazing  management  and intake
Table  8 shows  the intake  estimates  taken  in both 1995 and 1996.  Individual  
animal  intake  was measured  on 4 occasions  during  lactation  in 1995 (May  to 
November)  using  the n-alkane  technique  of Mayes  et al. (1986),  as modified  
by Dillon  and Stakelum  (1989).  Over the four intake  measurement  periods,  
concentrate  supplementation  levels  of feeding  systems  A, B and C averaged  
1.0, 3.5 and 1.0 kg/day,  respectively.  During  the 3 measurement  periods  in 1996  
(June  to September),  feeding  systems  A and C were  on grass  only while  feeding  
system  B was supplemented  with 3.0 kg of concentrates  daily.  For both years,  
the HGI group  had higher  intakes  (5% in 1995 and 8% in 1996).  In 1996,  the 
daily allowance  of herbage  (>4 cm) to achieve  these intakes  were 24, 21 and 
27 for feeding  systems  A, B, and C, respectively.  Supplementation  with  
concentrates  at pasture  significantly  increased  total dry matter  intake  (TDMI)  
in both  years  with small  reductions  in grass  dry matter  intakes  (GDMI). Previous  
studies  (with lower  milk producing  cows)  have shown  that when cows are 
supplemented  with concentrates  at pasture,  large substitution  rates can occur.
Previous  results  from  Moorepark  (Stakelum  et al., 1988)  suggest  that at daily  
intakes  of 10, 12, 14, 16 and 17 kg of grass  dry matter/cow,  substitution  rates

of 0.20,0.32,0.44,0.55  and 0.62 kg/kg  of concentrate,  respectively,  will result.  
The reduction  in grass intake  per kg of concentrate  offered  in study in 1996  
was 0.2. The consequence  of this is the very good milk yield response  to the 
concentrate  which  was achieved.  The increase  in intake  with feeding  system  
C averaged  0.5 kg/day  when compared  to feeding  system  A.
During  the dry period  of 1996,  individual  intakes  were  measured  on 20 HGI  
and 20 MGI  cows.  The genotypes  were  balanced  on expected  calving  date and 
received  high quality  silage  (75 DMD)  ad-lib.  The HGI cows  had significantly  
(P<0.01 ) higher  DM intakes  at 13/2 and 12.1 kg/cow/day  for the HGI  and MGI  
cows, respectively.
Liveweight  and condition  score
Table  9 shows  the liveweight  at critical  stages  of lactation  for both genotypes,  
while  Figure  3 shows  the effect  of genotypes  by week  of lactation.  Over  the 
total lactation,  the HGI cows gained  less liveweight  during  the lactation  (27 
kg in 1995;  59 kg in 1996)  compared  to the MGI  (42 kg in 1995;  86 kg in 1996).  
This was as a result  of either  losing  more liveweight  in early lactation  and/or
Week of Lactation

gaining  lower  liveweight  in the second  half of lactation.  The opposite  was the 
situation  during  the dry period  when  the average  liveweight  gain was 1.20 and 
0.90 for the HGI and MGI cows,  respectively.  This high level of liveweight  
gain during  the dry period  was achieved  on ad-libitum  high quahty  silage  (75 
DMD).  Feeding  system  had no effect  on liveweight  at any stage of lactation.
Table 10 shows  the condition  score  at similar  stages  of lactation  to that of 
liveweight  in Table  9. Condition  score  changes  follow  liveweight  changes  during  
lactation.  The condihon  score  of the HGI  cows  was lower  at all stages of lactation  
when compared  to the MGI cows,  while  again feeding  system  had no effect.

Fertility  performance
Table 11 shows  the effect  of cow genetic  index  on fertility  performance  for 
1996  and 1997.  The breeding  seasons  were  confined  to 13 weeks  in both years.  
There  was no effect  of cow genetic  index  on submission  rate,  calving-to-service-  
interval,  or calving-to-conception-interval.  However, the  HGI  cows  had a greater  
number  of services  per conception,  lower  pregnancy  rates  to 1 st and 2nd service  
with subsequently  higher  infertile  rates. There  was no indication  that feeding  
system  had any effect  on any of the fertility  parameters  measured.

system  evaluated  in this study.  However,  there was an indication  that the
10
response  to concentrates  was higher  with the HGI cows  in 1996 (1.12  and 
0.9 kg milk/kg  of extra concentrate  fed with the HGI and MGI cows,  
respectively).  It is also important  to emphasize  the narrow  range of the 
genotypes  used in this study.  The two years results  also indicate  that the 
difference  in milk production  between  the two genotypes  is very similar  
to that which  can be predicted  from the pedigree  index.
(2) There  is a clear  indication  in this study that selection  of cows for higher  
milk  production  leads  to higher  feed intake  as a consequence  of the genetic  
correlation  between  these  traits.  To accommodate  a cow with an RBI (95) 
of 135, as compared  to that of 100, it is estimated  that stocking  rate would  
have to be reduced  by between  15 and 20%, if most of the extra milk  
production  is to be obtained  from grazed  grass and silage.  With reduced  
stocking  rate in place then, it will depend  on grazing  management  skills  
of the farmers  to be able to consistently  maintain  a sward  of high quality.  
Cows,  regardless  of their  genetic  merit,  require  good  management  practices  
to be adhered  to if they are to perform  to their  potential.  This is especially  
so as the herd ’s CGI increases.
(3) The milk  yield  response  to feeding  extra  concentrates  at pasture  was much  
higher  than that  reported  previously with  lower  milk-producing  cows. Hoden  
et al. (1991)  reported  higher  milk yield  responses  from higher-producing  
cows. The higher  milk yield responses  are supported  with the lower  
substitution  rates  of concentrates  for grass  and no effect  of feeding  system  
on liveweight  change.  The milk  yield  response  to allocation  of extra  grass  
(system  C) was small  (190 kg). These  results  are supported  with the small  
increase  in GDMI  achieved.  However,  feeding  system  A (which  is the 
Control)  was managed  on a daily basis to provide  sufficient  high quality  
grass with a post-grazing  height  of 5 to 6 cm.
(4) The reduced  fertility  performance  of the HGI cows  is of concern  and will 
require  further  investigation.  However, evidence  is accumulating  to suggest  
that milk production  will mainly  reduce  reproductive  performance  when  
the intake  of energy  is insufficient  to meet current  milk output  and this 
results  in prolonged  negative  energy  balance  (NEB)  in early  lactation.  The 
severity  and duration  of NEB  may vary,  depending  on body condition  score  
at calving,  production  level,  ration  formulation  and environmental  factors.  
Studies  to define  more  precisely  the effect  of increasing  milk  yield  in early  
lactation on reproductive  performance,  especially  in Holsteins,  are required.  
Oestrus  detection  rates  and pregnancy  rates  for American  Holsteins  of less 
than 50% are accepted  widely  in the USA (Macmillan  et al., 1996).
Conclusions
The objective  of this study was to evaluate  the performance  of HGI and 
MGI  cows  on three  grassland  based  feeding  systems.  The results  clearly  show  
that cows of HGI produce  higher  yields  of milk and milk constituents.  There  
was no significant  CGI x feeding  system  interaction  observed  for any of the 
measurements  taken,  indicating  that HGI dairy  cows  do not respond  differently  
to feeding  system  when compared  to MGI cows (across  the range of diets
11
examined).  It is also evident  that HGI cows have higher  grass DM intake  and 
total DM intake.  The study also indicates  that HGI cows have a higher  rate 
of liveweight  loss in the post-calving  period,  and that HGI cows  have a lower  
live-weight  gain during  lactation,  suggesting  greater  body tissue  mobilisation.  
They also exhibit  higher  rates of gain during  the dry period.  The HGI cows  
clearly  maintain  a lower  condition  score at all stages  of lactation  suggesting  
a high  correlation  between  selection  for CGI and this trait. Feeding  system  had 
a significant  effect  on yield  of milk and milk  constituents,  DM intake,  and had 
no effect  on milk composition.  Feeding  system  had no effect  on live-weight,  
condition  score,  live-weight  change,  and condition  score  change.  In the present  
study,  milk yield  response  to additional  concentrate  fed was much  larger  than 
that reported  previously. Both  genotypes in the present  study are  of higher  genetic  
index than those in previous  studies.  The present  study may suggest  that 
increasing  CGI  has a detrimental  effect  on fertility  performance,  although  further  
research  is required  in this area.

Introduction
Competitive  agriculture  depends  on the efficient  production  of high quality  
food  in a clean  and healthy  environment.  Nutrient  inputs,  including  phosphorus  
(P) are essential  to optimise  production.  Irish farmers  are currently  spending  
over  £300  million  annually  on inorganic  fertiliser  of which  approximately  20%  
is spent  on P. Recent  research  suggests  that P inputs  into agriculture  have been  
too high in recent  years  in some  situations  (Tunney,  1990).  International  reports  
suggest  that there is considerable  potential  for P losses  from agriculture  into 
water  bodies  (Sharpley  and Rekolainen  (1997),  Lennox,  Foy, Smith  and Jordan  
(1997),  Sibbesen  & Sharpley  (1997).  In 1996, the P recommendations  for 
grassland  were reviewed  and revised.
Phosphorus  is an essential  element  for plant  and animal  life. In agricultural  
systems  P is needed  for seed and root formation,  and the accumulation  and 
release  of energy  during  cellular  metabolism  (Finkl  and Simonson,  1979).  In 
animals,  P is required  for bone formation  and a deficiency  can cause  
osteomalacea.  ‘Pica ’ or depraved  appetite  has been noted  in cattle  when  there  
is a deficiency  of P in the diet.  Low dietary  P may also be associated  with poor  
fertility  and apparent  dysfunction  of the ovaries  causing  inhibition,  depression  
or irregularity  of oestrus.
In the 1950s  soils were generally  extremely  deficient  in P, resulting  in low 
yields  of grass  and crops  and in some  areas  aphosphorosis  in livestock.  Farmers  
have,  over  the past three  to four decades,  rectified  this situation  by the constant  
application  of phosphatic  fertilisers.  Now  as we approach  the end of the 1990s,  
there appears  to be excessive  P being used in some parts of the agricultural  
production  system  and this is contributing  to eutrophication  of rivers  and lakes.
The sources  of P loss and the pathways  of P loss are the subject  of considerable  
controversy.  There  are three main sources  of P losses;-
1) Seepage  of soiled  water  from farmyards  appears  to be the main culprit  and 
there  is little  doubt  that if farmyard  design  and maintenance  were  improved,  
there  would  be less P pollution  of our waterways.  The EPA  have  suggested  
that up to 50% of agricultural  pollution  is due to seepage  from farmyards.
2) Slurry  spreading  in itself  will not lead to run-off  of P. It is spreading  slurry  
at the wrong  rates, or in the wrong  place,  or at the wrong  times that lead 
to slurry  finding  its way into drains,  rivers  and streams.  Spreading  slurry  
at reasonable  rates during  the grass growing  season  in places  where  there  
is no risk of runoff  into rivers/lakes  will ensure  no loss of P.
3) Elevated  soil P levels.  There  is evidence  that increasing  soil P levels  can 
lead to increased  P runoff  in areas  where  run-off  to water-bodies  is possible  
(Kurtz  et al., 1998).

This paper deals with agronomic  rather  than environmental  issues.  The 
objective  is to present  the background  and justification.
Soil testing
There  are many  soil testing  methods  used internationally  across  Europe  to 
measure  available  soil P. The method  used at Johnstown  Castle  is the Morgan ’s 
test. One study  of various  soil tests showed  that Morgan ’s extractant  compared  
favourably  with  the limited  range  of others studied  and was superior  to a modified  
Olsen  Extractant  (Brereton,  1970).  The for the Morgans  extractant  for a 
select  group  of sites that contained  Lolium  perenne  and other  sown  species  was 
43.5%.  It was 17% over a wider  range  of sites. The results  from the study  did 
not provide  the basis  for replacing  Morgan  extractant  with any of the alternative  
methods  tested.  Data from a plot experiment  on ryegrass  (Humphreys,  1996) 
and from  field  experiments  on 77 sugar  beet  soils  (Herlihy,  1986)  also indicated  
the superiority  of the Morgans  extractant  vis a vis other test methods  like 
conventional  Olsen  extractant.  For sugar  beet, Morgan  P accounted  for 34% 
of the variation  in fertiliser  P requirement,  Mehlich-2  for 35%,  Olsen  for 26%  
and 0.01 m CaCl^  for 16%.
There  is no doubt  that the Morgan  P test has limitations.  Furthermore,  in 
interpreting  the results  of the tests, no account  is taken  of differing  soil types  
(apart  from peats).  Nonetheless,  it would  appear  that it is as good  as any other  
extract  and will continue  to be used.  A new series  of trials on 8 different  soil 
types at different  levels of soil P was initiated  at Johnstown  in 1997. This 
investigation  will form  the basis of either  changing  to a different  extractant  or 
to adding  modifications  to Morgan ’s extractant  to cope  with  differing  soil types.  
In order  to cope with the shortcomings  of the Morgans,  a test with relatively  
wide  Index  bands  are used  to cope  with  as wide  a range  of variations  as possible.
Soil indices
When  soils are analysed  for nutrient  status  at Johnstown  Castle,  an index  
system  is used to categorise  them  into differing  soil P levels.  This index  system  
is presented  in Table 1. Agriculture  productivity  is very low at Index 1. The 
productive  species  like perennial  ryegrass  do not thrive  in this Index  and the 
stock  carrying  capacity  of land is this Index  is very poor. If stock  numbers  are 
to be increased,  phosphorus  must  be applied  at high rates in order  to get a full 
yield and to improve  the soil P status.  At Index  4, soil P levels  are very high 
and there is no agronomic  response  to further  phosphorus  fertiliser.  The aim 
of agricultural  productivity  should  be to have soils at Index  2 or Index  3. These  
issues  are discussed  in more detail under  the recommendations  section.

National  trends  in P levels  in soils
As already  noted,  Irish soils were grossly  deficient  in P (<1 mg/1) in the 
1940s  and 1950s  when  systematic^soil  testing  began.  During  the period  1950  
to 1991 the average  P levels  increased  over ten fold to 9.3 mg/1 (Fig. 1). Since  
1991 the levels  have dropped  a little and appear  to have stabilised  around  8 
mg/1.  The average  P content  of samples  received  at the soil laboratory  may not 
precisely  represent  the P status  of the country  for a number  of reasons.  It is 
not known  whether  there  is an undue  preponderance  of samples  from the more  
progressive  farmers  who might  tend to use more fertiliser.  Alternatively,  the 
majority  of the samples  could  have  been taken  from  less fertile  farms  in greater  
need of P which  would  tend to bias the result  downwards.  A random  sample  
of soils was taken  in 1981 (Brogan,  Kelly  and O’Keeffe,  1981)  and when  this 
was compared  with the average  samples  received  at the laboratory  it showed  
that advisory  samples  were 11% higher  in P than the random  sample.  REPS  
farmers  who  are generally  less intensive, have  been  shown to have  more  samples  
at lower  soil P levels  than the average  of the Non-REPS  farmers.  After 1993,  
large  numbers  of samples  have  been  received  from  REPS  farmers  and the recent  
mean  P values  in Figure  1, which  include  many  REPS samples,  may  be somewhat  
low for this reason.
The distribution  of P levels  in soil samples  for grassland  received  at the 
laboratory  from September  1996 to August  1997 is shown  in Table  2. Of the

15
samples  received,  20% had P levels  in Index  4 and 21% had soil P levels  in 
Index 1. It is quite clear that soils low in P should  be fertilised  if yields  are 
not to be severely  restricted  and there  is no justification  for further  P while  soils  
are in Index  4.
A county  by county  break-down  of the soil fertility  status of the country  
is given in Table  3. This is based  on soil analyses  of samples  received  at the 
laboratory  between  July 1993 and June 1996. The mean P level varies  from  
a high of 11.5 mg/1 in County  Carlow  to a low of 4.6 mg/1 in County  Donegal.  
Maps  showing  the P fertility  distribution  across  the country  have  been  published  
by Coulter  et al, 1996.

Phosphorus  recommendations  for silage
To achieve  optimum  silage  yield the soil P status  should  be adequate  and 
a maintenance  P dressing  should  be applied  to replace  the P that is being  removed  
in the crop.  Research  at Johnstown  Castle  shows  that full grass  production  under
16

for Clonroche  in 1995 and the corresponding  soil test P for each plot 
(equation  of the line is: y = 10 + 0.33x + 0.11x^-0.02x ’, R^=0.32).
cutting  conditions  can be obtained  at Morgan  soil test P levels  between  4 and 
6 (mg P/1) (soil Index 2), provided  maintenance  P dressings  are applied.
Target  yields  for first and second  cut silage  are 6 and 4 tonnes  dry matter  
per hectare  (t DM/ha),  respectively.  The P removals  for these crops at 0.3%  
P in the herbage  DM were calculated  for a soil at Index  2 (3.1 - 6.0 mg P/1) 
(Table  4).

Therefore,  for a one cut silage  system  18 kg P/ha are required  to replace  
the P removal  (maintenance)  and 30 kg P/ha are required  for a two cut system,  
where  slurry is not recycled.
Calculating  maintenance  P for silage  land
It is recommended  that slurry  from animals  fed on silage  should  be recycled,  
in proportion  to silage  yields,  to the land where  the silage was cut. Table 5 
summarises  the average  amount  of N, P, K available  in slurry.  Where  animals  
are fed 0.5 tonnes  of barley  based  concentrates  (or concentrates  supplemented  
with minerals)  per livestock  unit the recycled  slurry  will satisfy  most of the 
P requirements  of silage  land because  the animals  that consume  the silage  and 
concentrates  remove  only about 30% or less of the P present.  Therefore,  an 
annual  application  of 5.4 and 9 kg/ha  of fertilizer  P should  be adequate  for a
17
one and two cut silage  system,  respectively,  as the annual  maintenance  dressing  
for soils at Index  2. This does not include  P removed  in aftermath  grazing.

P guidelines  for silage  land
In the guidelines  in Tables  6 and 7, Soil Index  2 (3.1 - 6.0 mg p/1) is considered  
adequate  for grass cutting  and subsequent  grazing.  For early grass in silage  
areas we recommend  a soil P level of Index 3 (6.1 - 1 0 mg P/1). To ensure  
optimum  silage  yields  over a range  of soil types the P level should  ideally  be 
at or above  the mid point  of Index  2. Therefore,  an additional  increment  of 5 
kg P/ha should  be used for Index  2 when the soil P level is between  3.1 and 
4 mg/1.  Table  6 summarises  the chemical  P fertilizer  recommendation  for silage  
land where  all slurry  is recycled  to optimize  the P supply.  Additional  P will 
be required  where  no concentrates  are fed and less P will be required  where  
more than 0.5 tonnes  per LU is fed.

are fed and slurry  is recycled  (cut 1 from 50% of farm and cut 2 from 25% of

♦Reduce  these recommendations  by 2 kg/ha for every  0.1 t/LU/yr  increase  above  0.5 
t/LU/year  of concentrates  fed. Equally,  increase  by 2 kg/ha  for each 0.1 1 decrease  below  
0.5 t.
The fertilizer  P for silage  land where  slurry is not recycled  is shown in Table  6. 
To allow for variation  in soils and soil test results,  an insurance  factor  of 
30% more  than removals  is included  in the final recommendations  at Index  2 
shown  in Table  6. For the same reason  a small P fertilizer  input, of the same  
order,  is also recommended  at Index  3 where  slurry  is not recycled  (Table  7).
Farm  Management  Survey
The farm management  data for 1995 were used as the basis for a fertiliser  
use survey  (Murphy, Culleton,  Roche  & Power,  1997).  The farms  were  selected

by the Central  Statistics  Office  on the basis  of farm size and farming  systems.  
The survey  was carried  out on 1226 farms  and every  country  was represented.
The mean  P usage  for silage  and the influences  of various farming  systems  are
outlined  in Table 8.

The mean  P usage  for silage  was 20 kg/ha.  If slurry  was not recycled  onto  
silage  land then P usage  was close to recommended  levels.  However,  it must  
be assumed  that on most farms the slurry was recycled  and in this situation,  
P applications  to silage  were  significantly  higher  than  is agronomically  necessary.  
What  appears  to be happening  on many farms  is that the slurry  is applied  in 
the normal  way and a further  3-4 bags of 0-7-30  are also applied.  The point  
to be made  is that account  should  be taken  of the nutrient  value  of the slurry.  
Fertiliser  should  only be used to top up the shortfall  in requirements  that remains  
when the slurry is applied.
When  slurry  is recycled  the amounts  of P required  are small.  For first cut 
silage,  assuming  normal  fertility,  fertiliser  compounds  like 20;2'/2:5  are very  
useful.  They  can supply  all the N, P and K required.  For second  cuts, products  
like 25:2 ‘/2 :10 can be quite useful.
In silage  areas  where,  for one reason  or another, slurry  is not recycled,  0:7:30  
is still one of the key fertilisers  to be used. In the longer  term, the amount  of 
silage  land that does not receive  slurry will be getting  less and less, and the 
necessity  for products  like 0:7:30  - will presumably  also diminish.
19
Phosphorus  usage  for grazing  
P build-up  in soils
The phosphorus  (P) recommendations  for grazing  are more complex  than 
for silage.  For grazing,  the objective  is to fertilize  pastures  to produce  a grass  
supply  that meets  the demands  of the imposed  stocking  rate (SR) throughout  
the grazing  season.  At high SR, optimum  grass production  is required  from  
pastures  compared  with lower  stocking  rates where  grass production  targets  
will be lower.  In general,  farmers  manipulate  the grass supply  with nitrogen  
(N) fertilizer.  However,  P plays an important  role in determining  the annual  
pattern  and total grass  yields  from  grazed  grass.  Therefore,  optimizing  fertilizer  
P inputs  is an important  variable  in maximizing  the production  efficiency  of 
any animal  production  system  based  on grazed  grass.
When  soil P levels  are in Index I, there is little scope  for improvements  in 
productivity.  The productive  grasses like perennial  ryegrass  simply  do not survive  
at this level of soil P, while  grasses  like Agrostis  thrive  in these  impoverished  
situations.  If stock  numbers  are to be increased,  it is imperative  the soil P levels  
be improved  significantly.
Conway,  McLoughlin  and Murphy  (1972)  demonstrated  this very clearly  in 
a study  using  old permanent  pastures  for sheep  and cattle  production  systems  
in Ballintubber,  Co. Roscommon.  It was shown  that when  P was applied  to an 
impoverished  soil over  a four  year  period  and improved  management  strategies  
implemented  that the stocking  rate of cattle and sheep could be increased  
resulting  in a four fold increase  in liveweight  gain between  the first and the 
fourth  year. There  was a major  change  in botanical  composition  in the sward  
over the same period  (Table  9).

Culleton  (1989)  reported  similar  findings  intrials in Co. Wexford  with beef
cattle,  where  output  increased  dramatically  asthe perennial  ryegrass  content
improved  (Table 10).

A long term grazing  trial (Cowlands  trial) at Johnstown  demonstrated  this 
change  in botanical  composition  from  a different  point  of view.  A beef  grazing  
trial was commenced  in 1968, when 0, 15 and 30 kg P/ha were applied  to a 
soil at a P level of 6 mg/L.  At the commencement  of the trial the sward  was 
dominated  by perennial  ryegrass.  In the zero P treatment  the botanical  
composition  deteriorated  as the P levels  dropped.  In 1997 the P levels  in the 
zero P plots  were  2.0 (mg/1)  and the plots were  dominated  by Agrostis  species.  
Swards  in the higher  P treatments  are still dominated  by perennial  ryegrass.
It can be concluded  that if reasonable  productivity  is to be achieved,  it is 
imperative  that P be applied  in sufficient  quantities  to move the soil out of 
Index 1.
Work  at Johnstown  Castle  suggests  that at Index  2 the perennial  ryegrass  
can be maintained  in the sward  and reasonable  levels  of productivity  can be 
achieved.  At stocking  rates significantly  below  the stock  carrying  capacity  of 
the land there will be sufficient  grass produced  at Index  2. However  if there  
are aspirations  to further  increase  stocking  rates, P should  be applied  at rates  
that will move the soil out of Index 2 into Index 3.
The Cowlands  trial showed  that a soil P Index  of 3 (6.1 - 10.0 mg P/1) is 
required  for optimum  production  of grazed  grass. Therefore,  when farmers  
require  all the grass that the system  has the potential  to produce.  Index 3 is 
the target soil fertility  level. Recent  and current  grazing  trials at Taranaki  
Agricultural  Research  Station  in New Zealand  also support  this conclusion.  
This contrasts  with the results  from cutting  trials where  Index  2 is adequate.  
The reasons  for the differences  between  the results  of the grazing  and cutting  
trials cannot,  as yet, be explained.  However,  tentative  explanations  are as 
follows:-  the uneven  distribution  of dung pats as well as lower  efficiency  of 
P returns  in the dung pats from grazing  compared  with uniform  distribution  
of fertilizer  P in the cutting  trials.  Other  possible  reasons  are the necessity  for 
extra  P to ensure  that there is out-of-season  grass in grazing  systems;  the high  
tiller  density  with subsequent  increased  rooting  of grazing  systems  as opposed  
to silage  systems;  the higher  frequency  of defoliation  gives rise to increased  
root activity  and hence  higher  P requirements;  higher  P offtakes  in grazing  
systems.  The dietary  requirements  of dairy  cows  is another  factor  that must  be 
taken into account  and this is covered  in the section  on P levels  in herbage.
There  is some  evidence  in the literature  which  suggests  that soil with  Morgan ’s 
P levels  of < 4 mg/1 will restrict  grass  growth  in spring.  Murphy  (1977)  showed  
that P applied  in autumn/early  spring  gave 200 kg DM/ha  more grass in late 
March  than when no P was applied  at soil P levels  of 4 mg/1.  A new trial has 
been initiated  to verify this effect.  Preliminary  results  indicate  there was a 
significant  grass DM response  in March  and April at a soil P level of 2 mg/ 
1. There  was a significant  response  to 45 kg P /ha in April at soil P of 4 mg/ 
1. There  were  no differences  at higher  soil P levels.  These  results  are supported  
by New Zealand  work which  showed  a seasonal  response  at low Olsen ’s P 
(5-15 mgA)  compared  with no response  at higher  P soil levels  (Roberts,  1987).  
When  early grass is required  for grazing  be it in silage  or in grazing  ground  
Index 3 is the target soil fertility  level.
21
The quantities  of P required  to change  soil P levels  by 1 mg/1 is difficult  
to predict,  as it depends  on soil type and soil P level. It can take from 10 to 
more  than 100 kg P/ha to move  the available  P by one point  depending  on the 
soil. In light sandy  soils,  P levels  can be reduced  rapidly,  while  in heavier  soils  
it can take up to and maybe  more  than 100 kg of P removed  to drop the P by 
one point.  It is further  complicated  by the level  of P already  in the soil.  Available  
soil P of 20 mg/1 can be lowered  to 19 by the removal  of approximately  10- 
30 kg P/ha. It could  take the removal  of greater  than 100 kg P/ha to move  the 
available  P level from 5 to 4 mg/1.
If approximate  calculations  are to be made,  a figure  of say 40 kg P to 
change  the Morgan ’s P by one point  can be used e.g. to go from Morgan ’s P 
11 to 10 will need a net removal  from the soil of 40 kg P. At a stocking  rate 
2.5 LU/ha,  this will take approximately  3-4 years.
Phosphorus  can be applied  with equal  effectiveness  in autumn,  in spring  or 
in smaller  amounts  at frequent  applications  throughout  the year. At Index 1 
where  there are responses  to P, autumn  application  is beneficial.  Phosphorus  
in cold conditions  is less available  to plant  roots and if early  grass  is required,  
there  needs  to be a relatively  rich supply  of P. At Index  3, there  is no advantage  
to autumn  as opposed  to early spring  application.
P maintenance  in soils
The soil P levels  should  be adequate  to support  the required  level of grass  
production.  Once  the desirable  soil P level is attained  a maintenance  dressing  
of P should  be applied  to replace  the P that is being  removed  in animal  product  
and other unavoidable  losses.  Bertilsson  and Forsberg  (1997)  indicated  that 
when an adequate  level of soil fertility  is attained,  optimum  yields can be 
maintained  by replacing  the P that is removed  from  the farm system. Therefore,  
P is required  to replace  the nutrients  exported  off the farm in animal  product,  
P fixed by the soil and other losses  from roadways.
Phosphorus  recommendations  for grazing
Teagasc  P fertilizer  recommendations  for grazing  are based  on two principles  
1) Soil P must be built up to desirable  soil P levels,  as rapidly  and as 
economically  as possible.
Once  this level  has been achieved,  soil P levels  are maintained  by replacing
what is removed  or lost from the farm system.
As already  stated.  Index  1 represents  a state  of impoverishment  and if serious  
farming  is to be conducted,  it is imperative  that soil P levels  be built-up.  Table  
11 summarises  the guidelines  for P build-up  to either  Index  2 or Index 3.
Table 11

As already  stated,  Index  3 is the desired  soil P level for farming  at or near 
the stock carrying  capacity  of the soil. This level ensures  optimum  yields,  
satisfactory  grass growth  at both ends of the season  and ensures  that there is 
adequate  P in the herbage  to meet the dietary  requirements  of cows in most  
situations.  Once  this P status  is achieved,  P offtakes  should  be balanced  by P 
fertiliser.
A cow results  in the removal  of approximately  5 kg P per grazing  season.  
Therefore,  the amount  of P removed  is determined  by stocking  rate. Table 12 
outlines  the removals  at a range  of stocking  rates.  A number  of assumptions  
were  made  in calculating  these  offtakes  and these  are summarised  in Appendix
1.

The 5 kg/cow  removals  were made  on the basis of a milk yield of 5000  L/ 
cow. Table 13 shows  the offtakes  for a range  of milk yields  and stocking  rates.  
Changes  in milk yield of 1000 t/cow  would  mean a change  of 2.3 kg P/ha in 
the recommendations.

There  are situations  where  Index  3 P levels  are not required.  Irish soils have  
been classified  in terms of their stock carrying  capacity  (Lee and Diamond,  
1972)  and many  farmers  are stocked  below  the potential  of the soils. It is quite  
reasonable  that Index  2 P level is quite  sufficient  in this situation.  The amounts  
of P required  to maintain  the soil P test at Index  2 will be somewhat  greater  
than those  removed  by stock,  as there will be some  long-term  immobilisation  
of P by the soil. Table 14 outlines  the considerations  that can be taken into 
account  when deciding  whether  to opt for Index 2 or 3.

In REPS,  Index  3 is required  for stocking  rates at or near the limits  allowed  
for REPS  rates because  of the restrictions  in N use and the need for a good  
grass/clover  sward  for summer  grazing.
A summary  of the guidelines  for P when  Index  3 is the target  is summarised  
in Table 15.

Phosphorus  recommendations  for grazing  are complex.  There are still 
considerable  gaps  in our knowledge.  It is quite  possible  that as new information  
becomes  available  from the Johnstown  Castle  dairy trial and from new trials  
on the responses  to P over  a range  of soil types  and fertility,  the recommendations  
will be modified.
Nonetheless,  these recommendations,  which  are based on stocking  rates,  
targeted  soil fertility  levels  and offtakes,  are significantly  more focused  than 
previous  recommendations.  They  are also more  precise  and it should  be pointed  
out that when these recommendations  are followed,  it is vital to monitor  the 
P status  in the soil. Soil testing  should  be used not only to monitor  the amounts  
of fertilizer  needed  to ensure  optimum  yields  but also to ensure  that satisfactory  
soil P levels  are maintained.  In the light  of reduced  fertiliser  recommendations,  
it is vital that the soil be tested.  It is essential  that the following  protocol  for 
soil testing  is followed  correctly.
Protocol  for soil sampling
1. Map out discrete  areas of the farm that are uniform  in soil type, slope,  
drainage  and cropping  history.
2. Take a composite  sample  consisting  of 20 individual  cores  in each  designated  
area.
24
3. Cores  should  be taken to a depth  of 10 cm.
4. The cores should  be taken in “W” shape across  the sampling  area.
5. Avoid  unusual  spots like old fences,  ditches,  water  troughs  and gateways.
6. Avoid  dung  and urine  patches,  avoid  where  fertiliser  was stored  or spilled.
7. Do not sample  a field for P and K until 6 months  after last application  of 
fertiliser.  Do not sample  a field  for lime requirement  until  2 years  after  lime  
application.
8. Sample  at the same time of year on each sampling  occasion.
9. Sample  every 3 years in intensive  farming.
10. Sample  every 4-5 years in more extensive  farming.
11. Fill in the Soil  Identification  form  completely  (including  details  on texture).
12. Enter  map grid number  of each soil sample  identification  form.
13. To get a recommendation,  as well as nutrient  status statement,  include  
information  on crop to be harvested  and stocking  rates.
Fertiliser  use survey
The fertiliser  use survey  also examined  the use of P on grazing  areas and 
the results  are summarised  in Table  16. The table  shows  clearly  that the dairying  
sector  are the most  intensive  users  of P, while  cattle  rearing  farmers  use in the 
order  of 9 kg P/ha.  The farmers  with  pigs and poultry  obviously  use their  manures  
as they use only 4 kg/ha  of fertiliser  P. As stocking  rates increased,  the usage  
of P also increased.  However,  when comparing  the usage to the 
recommendations,  it is clear that at all stocking  rates recorded,  the usage  is 
somewhat  above  recommendations.  This  is especially  true at the more  extensive  
stocking  rates.

For Index  2 or 3 soils fertilisers  like 18:6:12,  0:10:20,  10:10:20,  27:272:5  
are all still very useful.  For extensive  dry stocking  farming  a new fertiliser  is 
being  manufactured  this year which  should  be very useful,  in that the amount  
of P has been reduced  a little,  while  the amounts  of K has remained  the same.  
The formulation  of this new product  is 18:4:12.  It is likely  that this product  
will be useful  in many  farms  that are currently  spreading  a little too much  P 
each year. This product  will be especially  useful  in extensive  beef farming  
provided  the grass is kept in the vegetative  stage.
There  is a movement  towards  using high N products,  thereby  spreading  
small  amounts  of P and K during  the grazing  season  when  the crop  needs  them.  
This is a trend that is likely  to continue  and it has the added  advantage  that 
this type of fertiliser  can be environmentally  friendly  in that only relatively  
small amounts  of P are being applied  at any one time and the risk of runoff  
is therefore  being reduced.
Herbage  P levels
One of the major  concerns  in this P debate  is the level of P in herbage.  A 
P trial is currently  being  conducted  in the dairy  at Johnstown  Castle.  The objective  
of the trial is to determine  the minimum  soil P level at which  dairying  can be 
carried  out efficiently.  The long term target  is to have 3 herds  of 21 cows  each  
grazing  soils with differing  P levels.  Herd 1 will be grazed  and fed silage  from  
soils with a P level of 2-4 mg/1. Herds  2 and 3 will be managed  similarly  on 
soils with P levels  of 6-8 and 11-12  (mg/1),  respectively.  At that stage,  similar  
maintenance  dressings  of P will be applied  to all treatments.
In 1996 Herd 1 land had soils around  4.7 and this received  no P fertiliser.  
Herd  2 land had soil P levels  of 8.5 and received  maintenance  dressings  of 13 
kg P/ha. Herd 3 land had P levels  of 10-12 mg/1 and received  20 kg P/ha.
The P in herbage  was recorded  pre-grazing,  throughout  the growing  season.  
The results  are summarised  in Table 18. While 1997 data are not complete,  
preliminary  results  suggest  that the P levels  in herbage  are not dissimilar  to 
1996.

In general  terms,  on well grazed  grassland  percentage  P remained  at reasonable  
levels  on a range of soil P levels  between  approximately  5 and 10 mg/1.
On silage  land the results  were somewhat  different  and in general  P 
concentrations  in silage  were lower  than in the grazing  sward  (Table  19). This  
may result from a dilution  effect i.e. as the grass yields  increase,  the P 
concentration  declines.

At the higher  soil and fertiliser  P levels,  the P concentrations  in first  cut silage  
were higher  than when the soil P levels  were low. The second  cut silage  had 
lower  P levels  than the first cut.
Fleming  and Murphy  (1968)  conducted  a series  of cutting  trials in the late 
1960s.  When  no phosphorus  was applied  to ryegrass  cut 9 times  during  the year,  
P levels  remained  around  0.3%.  When  21 kg P/ha was applied  %P started  in 
spring  at 0.6% and dropped  to 0.5% in late summer.  In silage  swards  P level  
fell to approximately  0.25%  in late May/early  June.
Table  20 summarises  the percentage  P in herbage  from the Cowlands  trial.  
There  were 3 phosphorus  treatments,  PO, P15 and P30 kg/ha  applied  annually  
at two stocking  rates, 1800 and 2400 kg liveweight  at turnout  in spring.  This  
shows  the P concentration  was reasonably  high  in all treatments  and at all stocking  
rates.  There  were  no real differences  in P levels  between  stocking  rates.  Herbage  
P levels  in the control  plots (PO) were quite high but were not as high as the 
P levels  in the PI5 and P30 plots.

27
These  results  suggest  that percentage  phosphorus  in grazed  herbage  is in the 
order  of 0.37-0.45%  provided  the grass  is well managed  and kept in the leafy  
vegetative  stage.  The P concentration  can be kept at this level over a range  of 
soil P levels  ranging  from  5 to 10 mg/1.  In general  terms,  these  levels  are adequate  
to meet  the dietary  requirements  of lactating  cows.  For very  high yields  it may  
be necessary  to supplement  with additional  P if there is a shortfall  in intake  
of P.
Future  phosphorus  research
1. There  is little doubt  that the soil P test is not adequate  for all soil types  and 
all situations.  It is primarily  useful  in giving  guidelines  as to the P status  
of the soil. A new trial started  in 1997 on thirty sites around  the country  
will hopefully  shed new light on responses  to P, as well as bringing  new 
information  about  Morgan ’s P test and other possible  new soil P tests.
2. Quantification  of pathways  of P loss from agriculture  to water.  The 
production  of an easy to use methodology  of assessing  the risk of P loss 
to the environment  is required.  Factors  to be considered  are soil types,  soil 
P level slope,  rainfall,  drainage  systems  and proximity  to water.  The 
contribution  of farmyards  and slurry  needs  to be clarified.  Some  areas  are 
more  vulnerable  to P loss than others.  Knowledge  of these  vulnerable  zones  
and how to define  them  could  greatly  help in devising  strategies  to reduce  
P losses.
3. More  detailed  work  on soil chemistry  is required.  We need to know  more  
about  the fate of fertiliser  P when it is applied  to soils, we need to know  
more  about  how it reacts  with the organic  and inorganic  matter  in the soil, 
we need  to know  more  on the role of pH, the timing  and rate of application,  
and the interaction  with nitrogen  and other  elements.
4. Role of organic  phosphorus  in contributing  to pasture  production  and the 
study  of the factors  which  affect  the mineralisation  of organic  P throughout  
the season  in different  soils.
5. Role of livestock  units in determining  offtakes  needs to be elucidated  
further.
Conclusions
The phosphorus  recommendations  in this paper  are based on the best 
information  available.  There  is a considerable  amount  of work  being  conducted  
on P at national  and international  level and there is a possibility  that there  will 
be further  revisions  in the management  of soil P levels  in the future.  There  is 
evidence  for reduction  in soil P levels  while still ensuring  optimum  growth.  
Two points  must be made.  Firstly,  it will be difficult  to reduce  soil P levels  
any further  without  significant  improvements  in soil testing  methodology.  
Secondly,  it must be remembered  that grass is an intermediate  product;  it is 
the nutritional  requirements  of the ruminant  that is paramount.  Any future  
changes  in P recommendations  must ensure  that the P in the grazed  grass is 
sufficient  to meet the dietary  requirements  of the cows.

APPENDIX  1
Assumptions  Made  in Calculating  Offakes  in Dairy  System
1) P content  of milk = 0.9 g/kg.
2) Cull cows.
1 kg liveweight  = 8.0 g P 
Replacement  rate = 20%
Mean weight  = 500 kg
Mean weight  of replacement  heifers  = 500 kg
3) Calves  are sold off in dairying  at a mean  weight  of 50 kg and the P content  
is 8 g/kg liveweight.  Some  20%  of the weight  of the foetus  at birth  is gained  
during  the grazing  season.
4) There  is a loss of P in dung  while  cows are not in the paddocks.  This has 
been calculated  at 1.8 kg/cow/yr  (Morton,  1984).  However,  much  of this 
loss occurs  in the milk  parlours  and yards  and this is either  recycled  directly  
to some  field as soiled  water  or it is washed  into the slurry  storage  areas.  
Thus  the P lost to the system  is that contained  in the dung  which  is deposited  
on farm roadways.  This can be lost to rivers,  streams  and lakes when  rain 
washes  it off the roadways.  This is calculated  as 0.18 kg/cow  (3 hours  off 
the paddocks  per day during  the grazing  season,  at intake  of 16 kg DM/  
day = 1.8 kg P/cow,  10% of that time on roadways).
5) The amount  of P fixation  and soil P release  is difficult  to quantify.  At 
maintenance  P levels  in Index  3, for the purposes  of these  calculations,  we 
have assumed  zero fixation.  An arbitrary  allowance  of 2 kg/ha  P over and 
above  maintenance  is allowed  at Index 2.
6) The removals  of P take into account  that enough  silage  is made to give 
adequate  feed during  the winter  months.
7) All calculations  are based  on a spring  calving  herd.  The requirements  would  
be lower  for an autumn  calving  herd.

Grassland  Management  - The Effect  
on Herd Performance

Current  changes  in agricultural  policy  and future  expected  changes  will 
continue  to remove  the relatively  high level of protection  engaged  by the EU 
countries.  Market  forces  are likely  to determine  producers  returns  much  more  
in the future.  With lower  milk price and the possibility  of increased  milk  
production  (no - quotas)  Irish  dairy  farmers  will have  to become  more  efficient  
producers  of milk. Grazing  grass  in situ at a reasonable  level of utilisation  will 
remain  the simplest  and most  efficient  method  of milk production.  With good  
grazing  management  we can have  a long grazing  season  with high quality  feed 
available  at low cost. A research  programme  was set up in Moorepark  in the 
Autumn  of 1995 to investigate  if increased  measurement  at farm level could  
influence  the performance  being  obtained  from  grazed  grass.  The farms  selected  
were intensive  dairy farms which  were already  achieving  above  average  
performance.  The increased  performance  would  result  in improved  financial  
returns.  The measurements  that would  have most influence  on performance  
were:
(1) Pasture  cover
(2) Post-grazing  sward  height
(3) Pasture  quality
(4) Cow condition  score
Other  measurements  which  were already  being  monitored  on these farms  
included  milk yield,  milk  composition,  cow fertility  performance,  concentrate  
input  and silage  quality  and yield.  Thirteen  dairy herds  were initially  selected  
for this project.  All herds  were  visited  twice  monthly  from  March  to September  
and once monthly  for the remainder  of the year. All four measurements  were  
taken  on each  visit.  The grazing  management  practises  of these  farms  have  now  
being monitored  for two and a half years.  The questions  being  asked  in the 
project  are: (1) What  major  deficiencies  in terms  of grazing  management  have  
been identified  on these farms?  (2) Has the use of more measurements  been  
a benefit  in correcting  these deficiencies?  (3) What  are the recommendations  
arising  from these measurements?
(1) Pasture  cover
Pasture  cover  is defined  as the total supply  of available  grass  (>4cm)  on all 
the paddocks  which  are available  for grazing.  Paddocks  closed  for silage  are 
not included.  Four main areas were identified  where  a knowledge  of pasture  
cover  was of significant  benefit.
(a) Closing  cover  in late November/early  December.  Figure  1 shows  closing  
average  farm covers  for six Spring  calving  herds  over the last 3 years  (1995-
31
Fig. 1 - Average  pasture  cover  at closing  in Autumn  for six Spring  
Calving  Herds  1995 - 1997.
1997).  The figure  clearly  shows  large increases  in closing  cover  over the past 
3 years.  The benefit  seen at farm level of an increased  closing  cover  is a much  
increased  Spring  grass  supply.  Increasing  opening  Spring  cover  demands  a higher  
level of utilisation  by earlier  turnout  and making  more grass available  during  
the first cycle.  The results  also showed  that grazing  very large  covers  (>2800  
kg DM/ha)  in the last grazing  rotation  was detrimental  for perennial  ryegrass  
survival  and grass supply  the following  Spring.
Therefore  the main  findings  concerning  pasture  closing  cover  were:
(i) Farm  grass  cover  should  be >350  kg DM/ha  with a range  in paddock  cover  
of 200 - 800 kg DM/ha.
(ii) The farm  should  be closed  in rotation,  with  the first  paddock  closed  between  
the 10th - 15th of October.
(iii) By the end of the first week  of November  60%  of the farm  should  be closed  
and all grazing  should  cease by late November.
(iv) Large covers  >2000kg  DM/ha  should  be avoided  on the last grazing  
rotation.
(b) Opening  pasture  cover  in the Spring
The benefit  of grazed  grass  as part of the diet in early lactation  with Spring
32
calving  dairy cows has long been identified.  It is not possible  to suggest  one 
turnout  date for all dairy farms.  This will very much  depend  on grass supply,  
stocking  rate, calving  pattern,  soil type and the implication  of other  enterprises  
on the farm. It also has implications  on target  Mean  Calving  Date.  The project  
has identified  that a knowledge  of pasture  cover  can be used  to make  maximum  
use of grazed  grass  from  mid February  to late April.  Figure  2 shows  the average  
turnout  cover  on six Spring  calving  herds for the last 3 years.
It is evident  from the data that considerable  improvement  has taken  place  
on these farms with regard  to pasture  cover  at turnout  in late February/early  
March.  Figure  3 shows  how turnout  with very low pasture  cover  can actually  
reduce  the amount  of grass utilised  over the Spring.  Whereas  if turnout  takes  
place at the proper  cover  the grass available  can be maximised  in the cow ’s 
diet. However  over the past two Springs  the former  has been the situation  on 
some  dairy  farms  where  turnout  was too late and optimised  use of Spring  grass  
was not achieved.
Fig. 3 - The effect  of two levels  of pasture  cover  at turnout  on 
subsequent  Spring  cover.
Tables  1 and 2 show feed budgets  for two contrasting  farms.  For the purpose  
of comparison  the two farms  were 100 cow herds  with similar  calving  patterns.  
Farm  1 has access  to 40 ha (100  acres)  of grazing  area,  while  Farm  2 has access  
to 22 ha (54 acres).  Both farms  have a turnout  cover  of 600 kg DM/ha.  The 
farms  have  different  turnout  dates  and turnout  only occurs  when  the cows  can 
be allowed  6 kg DM/cow.  Both of these farms  have a target  cover  of 800 kg 
DM/ha  on the grazing  area in mid April at similar  stocking  rates. Because  of 
the larger  grazing  area, a lot more grass can be allocated  to the cows in Farm  
1, Farm  2 cannot  turnout  as early or allow  the same level of grass because  of 
the grazing  area  constraint.  From  turnout  until mid April  Farm  1 is able to allow  
a total of 1.0 t grass/DM/cow,  while  Farm  2 can only allow  0.62 t grass/DM/  
cow. This shows  the benefit  of using  pasture  cover  measurement  to exploit  the 
extra grass which  is available  because  of the lower  stocking  rate and earlier  
turnout.

The main  finding  regarding  turnout  date and budgeting  of the feed:
(i) Turnout  should  begin  with a pasture  cover  of 550-600  kg DM/ha  at 2.75 
cows/ha,  lower  turnout  covers  are possible  at lower  stocking  rates.
(ii) The available  feed should  then be budgeted,  and the first rotation  should  
finish  between  the 10th-20th  April  (the day grass  supply  equals  grass  demand).  
This date can vary from year to year. The precise  date to finish  the round  can 
only be found  by careful  monitoring  of pasture  supply.
(iii) Pasture  cover  target  on the 20th April should  be 750 - 800 kg DM/ha  
at a stocking  rate of 4.5 cows/ha  on the grazing  area
(c) IdentiHcation  of surpluses  and deficits
The results  from the study have shown  that cow performance  can be 
influenced  by early identification  of a surplus  or a deficit  grass supply  with 
the use of pasture  cover  measurement.  An extremely  steep wedge  pattern  of 
grass supply  (going  from 350 to 3000kg  DM/ha)  indicates  an oversupply  of 
grass. Grazing  large covers  during  the main grazing  season  (>2500  kg DM/  
ha) will often result  in reduced  milk production  or necessitate  topping  large  
residuals.  In the lead up to a period of a grass  shortage  pre-cutting  some  paddocks
34
would  facilitate  better  utilisation  of large pre-grazing  yields  especially  in dry 
weather  conditions.  The reaction  on most  dairy  farms  to large  pre-grazing  yields  
of grass was to remove  the surplus  grass as silage.  If silage  harvesting  was 
delayed  then it resulted  in (a) reduced  pasture  cover  (b) increased  stocking  rate 
on the grazing  area. Farmers  that delayed  harvesting  these surplus  paddocks  
generally  had a grass shortage  in the next rotation.  Using  pasture  cover in 
conjunction  with grass DM available  per cow and a forecast  of future  grass  
growth  rates over the following  7 to 10 days will allow better  management  
decisions  to be made.
If grass  growth  rates are below  normal  and/or  stocking  rate too high a less 
pronounced  wedge  shaped  grass  supply  pattern  will result.  Cows  will be going  
into paddocks  with low covers  (<1500  kg DM/ha).  Running  covers  down  to 
very low levels  will result in even more reduced  grass growth  rates at farm  
level and will generally  result  in the under  feeding  of the cows.  Pasture  cover  
measurements  will identify  a future  problem  with  grass  supply  before  pre-grazing  
yield will. Therefore  the use of pasture  cover measurement  will allow  
management  decisions  to be put in place at an earlier  stage i.e. stocking  rate 
can be adjusted  or supplements  can be introduced.
The main  findings  regarding  identification  of surplus/deficits  are:
(i) Pasture  cover  should  be maintained  at 900 -950 kg DM/ha  or 200 kg DM/  
cow on the grazing  area during  the main grazing  season.
If pasture  cover  increases  to greater  than 1000 kg DM/ha  from mid April  
to mid July the surplus  grass should  be removed  as silage.  The surplus  
paddocks  should  be harvested  as silage  at day 21 to 25 in the rotation,  
(iii) With a decreasing  pasture  cover,  the herd should  be supplemented  or the 
grazing  area should  be increased  by including  some  silage  paddocks.  This  
should  be introduced  early enough  so as not to let the pasture  cover  drop  
below  700 kg DM/ha.
(d) Obtaining  high performance

herds over  the grazing  season  of 1997.  The  data  indicate  that the lowest  allowance  
of grass occurred  in the late April to early June period.  This is the period  of 
peak milk production  and also coincides  with the breeding  season.  Figure  5 
shows  the milk production  profde  for the six Spring  calving  herds.  In 1997,  
average  milk production  in kg milk/cow/day  was 28.0, 25.3, 24.2, 23.1, 19.5,  
16.9 for the months  of April, May,  June,  July,  August  and September  respectively.  
The average  reduction  in milk yield  from  April  to May (2.7kg  milk/cow),  May  
to June  (1.1kg  milk/cow),  June  to July (1.1kg  milk/cow),  July to August  (3.6kg  
milk/cow),  August  to September  (2.6kg  milk/cow),  September  to October  (3.3kg  
milk/cow),  October  to November  (4.5kg  milk/cow).  The mean  calving  date for 
these herds was March  1st. Therefore  peak milk production  should  occur  in 
May.  The milk production  data show  a large  milk yield  reduction  in May. This 
reflects  inadequate  feeding  which  can be seen in Figure  4 with the low grass  
allowance  and the use of very little supplement.  The factor  that will create  the 
largest  pressure  on grass  supply  in this period  is the stocking  rate on the grazing  
area. Stocking  rates of 5 cows/ha  or greater  are too high unless  large levels  
of supplerrient  are being  fed. Some  farms on the study  carried  very high  stocking  
rates during  this period  and very little supplements  were fed. Table  3 shows  
the daily allowance  of grass and the availability  of grass per cow (kgs DM/  
cow = Pasture  cover/stocking  rate) at varying  stocking  rate using average  
Moorepark  grass growth  rates (1990-1996)  from April 22 to May 27.

36
The major  findings  with regard to obtaining  high  performance  from  grazed  
grass:
(i) A stocking  rate of 4.5 cows/ha  from mid April to early  June is sufficient  
to maintain  the correct  balance  of pasture  supply  and grass allowance  to 
adequately  feed cows at pasture.
(ii) Very high stocking  rates (>5 cows/ha)  from  mid April  to June  will result  
in inadequate  grass  supply and  result  in underfeeding  of cows  unless  large levels  
of supplement  are fed.
(2) Post-grazing  sward  height
The degree  to which  any paddock  is grazed  is a function  of grass  availability  
versus  herd requirement.  Table  4 outlines  the post-grazing  height  that results  
from  different  grazing  intensities.  If a paddock  is grazed  to a post-grazing  height  
of 4cm, then the grass intake  of the herd will be very much  reduced.  If on the 
other  hand a pasture  is grazed  to a post-grazing  height  of 8cm, intake  will be 
high but a large level of grass will be wasted.  On some farms post-grazing  
height  ranged  from 4.5 to 5.5cm  for a large part of the grazing  season.

1 <4.5 grossly  over-grazed
2 4.5 - 5.5 over-grazed
3 5.5 - 6.5 good grazing
4 6.5 - 7.5 under-grazed
5 >7.5 grossly  under-grazed
Figure  6 shows  the post-grazing  height  and corresponding  grass  allowance  
over the year for one of the Spring  calving  herds on the study. In this case,  
there  was an inadequate  grass  allowance  and a low grazing  intensity.  Low  post­
grazing  height  could be the results  of two situations  at farm level.
(i) Low pasture  cover  as a result  of below  normal  grass growth  rates or too 
high a stocking  rate.
(ii) Even with adequate  pasture  cover  daily allocation  of grass may not be 
adequate.
Both of these  two situations  were recorded  at farm level.  Low post-grazing  
height  as a result  of low pasture  cover  generally  occurred  in the mid April to 
June period.  This was mainly  as a result  of too high a stocking  density  (5 to 
5.5 cows/ha)  where  the farmer  attempted  to maintain  a 21 day rotation  with  
very little supplementation.  It also occurs  during  the main grazing  season  in 
periods  of below  normal  grass growing  conditions  where no adjustment  in 
stocking  rate occurred  and no supplements  were fed. Low post-grazing  heights  
with adequate  pasture  cover  also occurred.  This took place generally  where  
grass  was being  allocated  on a 12 hour basis  (after  each milking)  at farm level.  
A 24 hour allocation  may be more conducive  to achieving  higher  intakes  of

high grass utilisation.
The main  findings  on the monitoring  of post-grazing  sward  heights  were:
(i) Very  low post-grazing  height  was much  more  evident  on the farms  studied  
rather  than high post-grazing  heights.
(ii) The main  reason  for very low post-grazing  height  was very high stocking  
rates with low pasture  cover.
(iii) Very low post-grazing  height  also occurred  with adequate  pasture  cover  
where  over emphasis  was placed  on achieving  high utilisation  to the 
detriment  of cow performance.
(3) Pasture  quality
The measurement  of pasture  quality  which  was used in this study was the 
measurement  of the proportion  of green  leaf available  in the sward  (>4cm).  
Moorepark  studies  have  shown  a direct  relationship  between  proportion  of green  
leaf  and digestibility.  For optimum  milk  production  the proportion  of green  leaf 
should  be >65% of DM available. Most  farms  achieved  very  high  quality  pastures  
over the grazing  season.  However  there were a number  of situations  at farm  
level where  the proportion  of the sward  decreased  below  65% green  leaf. These  
were:
(i) Where  rotation  length  was in excess  of 25 days in mid May/June,  30 days  
in July/August  and 40 days in September.
(ii) In periods  of below normal  grass growth  rates and in semi-drought  
conditions  where  large amounts  of stem development  were evident.
(iii) In pastures  which  contained  less than 50% ryegrass.  These  pastures  had 
generally  lower  pasture  quality  throughout  the grazing season.  The greatest

deterioration  in quality  took place  in mid season  on these  pastures.  Figure  
7 shows  the percentage  of green leaf in the grass offered  to one of the 
Spring  calving  herds.
The main  findings  with regard  to pasture  quality  were:
(i) ■■ ■
(ii)Most  farms  maintained  veryTiigh  pasture  quality  over the grazing  season.  
This was achieved  by not leaving  large residuals  after  the previous  grazing  
and using pasture  topping,  if required.
The main  reason  for reduced  pasture  quality  was  an extended  rotation  length  
for the time of year.
(4) Cow condition  score
Body  fat reserves  are important  for the dairy  cow. Immediately  after  calving,  
the cow ’s capacity  to consume  energy in feed  does  not keep  pace  with  the amount  
of energy  being  used for milk production.  This is even more important  in very 
high producing  cows.  Therefore,  the cow must  draw  on body  reserves  to make  
up the difference.  A cow with good body reserves  may be in a better  position  
to support  milk  production  and may  have  better  subsequent  fertility  performance.  
There  are three periods  in the year when condition  score is important.
(a) Drying  off/end  of lactation,  (b) At calving,  (c) Start  of breeding  season
(a) It is important  to monitor  condition  score towards  the end of lactation.  
Condition  score can be easily modified  at this stage by either  adjusting  the 
length  of the dry period  or the level of feeding  during  this period.  Average  herd  
condition  score at the end of lactation  should  be around  3.
(b) Condition  score at calving  is important  and will influence  the level of 
supplementation  during  early  lactation.  TTie target  herd  condition  score  at calving  
is 3.5. In early lactation,  when energy  intake  is less than current  requirement  
for milk production,  condition  score manipulation  may be difficult.
(c) It is important  that cows  are in good  condition  at the start of the breeding  
season  and that this is maintained  throughout  the breeding  season.  A target
39
condition  score  of 2.9 at the start of the breeding  season  with Spring  calving  
dairy cows should  be the aim. Table  5 shows  the average  condition  score for 
two Spring  calving  herds  of similar  genetic  merit  in the herds  monitored.  Table  
6 shows  the fertility  performance  for the same  two herds. While  it is not possible  
from  this study  to make  a definite  cause/effect  relationship,  it does indicate  that
there is a large difference  in fertility  performance  as well as herd condition  
scores  between  both herds.

Conclusion
This paper  clearly  outlines  the large  benefit  obtained  at farm level from an 
increased  use of measurement.  Measurements  will allow  dairy  farmers  to achieve  
much  higher  levels  of performance  from  grazed  grass.  They  also allow  research  
findings  to be more  readily  adopted  at farm level.  With the increased  use and 
focus on discussion  groups  as a method  of technology  transfer,  these  
measurements  are essential  and should  be an integral  part of the discussions.

Dairy Cattle  Breeding  in Ireland  - 
The Way Forward
B. WICKHAM
Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation,  Bandon,  Co. Cork.
In this paper I will cover:
• The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation ’s mission,  membership  and method  
of operation.  The Federation  has been established  to lead the way forward.
• Co-operation  is one of the fundamental  elements  required  for successful  
cattle  breeding.  Co-operation  between  farmers,  cattle  breeders,  AI services,  milk  
recording  organisations,  breed associations  and animal  evaluation  units is 
essential  if the potential  benefits  of cattle breeding  are to be fully exploited.
• An integrated  database  breeding  information  is an essential  component  
of a successful  dairy breeding  program.  The establishment  of a computerised  
database  is one of the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation ’s major  priorities.
• The technical  aspects  of cattle  breeding  will ultimately  determine  the speed  
with which  improved  genetics  contribute  to the profitability  of dairy farming  
in Ireland.  Breeding  objectives,  animal  evaluations,  progeny  testing,  semen  
technology  and embryo  technology  all make  important  contributions  to the rate 
of genetic  gain. These  issues  and the way they affect  rates of genetic  gain are 
well understood.
• Cattle  breeding  is one of many  inputs  into  milk  production.  It must  compete  
with  other  uses  of farmer ’s increasingly  scarce  money.  For this reason  Customer  
Focus  will become  an important  aspect  of the provision  of cattle breeding  
services  in Ireland.
• Dairy  farmers  are facing  on on-going  cost/price  squeeze.  The number  of 
dairy cattle is declining.  For these reasons  the efficiency  with which  cattle  
breeding  services  are provided  will play a significant  role in determining  their  
future  in Ireland.
Mission
The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  has been established  by its members  
with the mission  of: Leading  the development  of cattle  breeding  in a way 
which  will best serve  the national  commercial  livestock  sector.  Note that 
this mission  is focused  on the commercial  livestock  sector.  The commercial  
sector  are those  farmers  for whom  milk and meat production  is a business.  It 
also requires  the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  to provide  leadership  in the 
ongoing  development  of cattle breeding.
The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  is registered  as a Co-operative  and its 
membership  includes:
8 Artificial  Insemination  Societies,  13 (9 major)  Milk Recording  Societies,  
12 Cattle Breed  Societies,  Irish Farmers  Association,  Irish Creamery  Milk  
Suppliers  Association  and the Irish  Meat  Association.  These  organizations  have  
decided  to establish  the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  as a way of ensuring
41
an orderly, technologically  advanced  and efficient  progression  of cattle  breeding  
services  in Ireland.
A small headquarters  for the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  has been  
established  in Bandon  which  is operated  by South  Western  Services.  This  
decision  was made  after considering  a large number  of alternatives.  The main  
considerations  were: the need to avoid  further  overheads  on cattle breeding,  
availability  of suitable  accommodation,  availability  of support  services  and the 
avoidance  of conflicts  of interest  with the organization  providing  the 
accommodation.
Structure
The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  has an interim  Board  chaired  by Mr. 
John Malone,  the Secretary  of the Department  of Agriculture.  Two advisory  
committees  provide  the Board  with specific  advice  on matters  relating  to Beef  
Cattle  and Dairy  Cattle  breeding.  The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  will be 
utilizing  staff  and resources  from  within  its member  organizations  and employing  
outside  expertise  on a contract  basis.  In the longer  term  there  will be a requirement  
for further  Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  staff.
Funding
Funding  of the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  is initially  being  provided  
by contributions  from the member  organizations,  EU structural  funds  and by 
the Department  of Agriculture.  In the longer  term, funding  will increasingly  
be from the provision  of services  to the cattle  breeding  industry.  The challenge  
for Irish  Cattle  Breeding  Federation  and its member  organisations  is to develop  
services  which  cattle  breeders  will value and happily  pay for the full cost of 
provision.  The Department  currently  contributes  some £1 million  to cattle  
breeding  in the form of animal  evaluation,  quality  assurance  and beef  breeding  
services.  In due course  the Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  will either  take 
over these  services  or establish  alternatives  which  better  meet  the needs  of the 
cattle breeding  industry.
Co-operation
The reasons  why  dairy  cattle  breeding, in contrast  to pig and poultry breeding,  
remains  a co-operative  based  industry  include:
• The value of a commercial  animal,  relative  to the cost of recording  
production  is high - of the order of 100:1 in Ireland.  This means  that it is 
comparatively  easy  to keep for commercial  cows  the records  needed  for breeding  
purposes.
• The records  required  for breeding  purposes  are also  useful for other  purposes  
such  as disease  control,  quality assurance  and subsidies.  Thus  the cost of keeping  
the records  needed  for breeding  purposes  is further  reduced.
•Artificial  insemination  provides  an inexpensive  mechanism  for distributing  
superior  genetics  to commercial  herds.  This means  that at least  within a country,  
commercial  milk producers  are able to access  the best sires at the same time 
as specialized  breeders.
42
• International  trade in animal  genetics  is well established  based  on shared  
information.  Breeders  around  the world  have access  to the best sires and to a 
slightly  less extent  dams,  in all countries  at about  the same  time. This makes  
it very difficult  for a single  organization  to gain a significant  genetic  advance  
over the co-operative  organizations.
The future  of Irish dairy  cattle  breeding  will thus be based  on co-operation  
between  farmers,  breeders,  AI organizations,  researchers,  breed associations  
both within  Ireland  and internationally.
Database
Successful  dairy  cattle  breeding  requires  access  to data on the ancestry  and 
performance  of large numbers  of cows.  A national  computerised  database  is 
the best way of providing  this information  while  avoiding  duplication  of effort,  
minimizing  errors  and facilitating  the sharing  of data  with  other  legitimate  users.  
The key database  concepts  are:
• There  is only a single  copy of the “truth ”. This means  that all changes  to 
data - new data corrections  to existing  data - are made in only one place.
• All legitimate  users  of the data  have  access  to the single  copy.  This  ensures  
that all users of the data are able to obtain  the correct  information.
Cattle  breeding  databases  with these characteristics  have been established  
in a number  of countries.  The two I_am most  familiar  with are in New  Zealand  
and Holland.  In both cases single  databases  are meeting  the needs of cattle  
breeding  while  also meeting  needs  associated  with disease  control  and quality  
assurance.  The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  is planning  to establish  such  
a database  for cattle  breeding  purposes  in Ireland.  Three  options  for establishing  
the database  are to be evaluated:
• To build one from first principles.  The main advantage  of this approach  
is that it guarantees  a database  customised  to Irish conditions.
• To purchase  an existing  database  from another  country  with similar  cattle  
breeding  requirements  to Ireland  and to modify  it to meet Irish needs.  This is 
potentially  a more rapid way of obtaining  the database.
• To contract  the provision  of database  services  to another  country  with a 
suitable  database
These  options  will be evaluated  and a decision  made on the best way to 
proceed  for Ireland.
Animal  evaluation
Animal  evaluation  systems  combine  data on ancestry  with animal  
performance  data to estimate  the genetic  merit  of individual  animals.  The Irish  
Cattle  Breeding  Federation  has decided  to give  immediate  priority  to addressing  
issues  of the time required  for the calculation  of breeding  values,  frequency  
of breeding  value calculation  and the number  of animals  evaluated.  The 
objectives  of the review  are to:
• Resolve  data  quality  issues which  cause  delays  in the calculation  of breeding  
values.
• Reduce  the time taken for the calculations  to 4 weeks  including  time for 
data to be sent to and received  from INTERBULL.
43
• Provide  evaluations  twice  per year.
• Increase  the number  of animals  for which  breeding  values  are readily  
available  above  the current  figure  of 50% of milking  cows in milk recorded  
herds.
• Implement  an improved  system  within  twelve  months.
An example  of what  can be achieved  is provided  by the new system  which  
was recently  implemented  in New Zealand.
The NZ animal  evaluation  system  comprises  two main  elements.  Every  day 
the breeding  values  are updated  for all females  with new milk  recording  results.  
Every  three  weeks  the breeding  values  for all animals  are updated.  Twice a year 
the latest INTERBULL  results  are incorporated  into the NZ evaluations.
One of the consequences  of the continual  updating  of breeding  values  is that 
it has become  possible  for newly  proven  bulls  to be used  widely on  liquid  semen  
prior to their first crop of daughters  completing  a first lactation.  There are 
substantial  genetic  implications  associated  with the shorter  generation  intervals  
thus achieved
Breeding  scheme  design  is one of the most  fruitful  aspects  of cattle  breeding  
research.  It provides  a rational  basis for making  major  decisions  on aspects  of 
cattle  breeding.  The Irish  Cattle  Breeding  Federation  will be initiating  research  
work to ensure  its breeding  decisions  have a sound  scientific  basis.
Breeding  objective
The technical  aspects  of cattle  breeding  centre  on breeding  objectives,  animal  
evaluation  and breeding  scheme  design.  Breeding  objectives  define  the goal
of cattle  breeding.  The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation,  with its focus  on the 
commercial  producers,  is considering  a review  of cattle  breeding  objectives  for 
Ireland.  The purpose  of focusing  on breeding  objectives  is that they provide  
a rational  basis for deciding  which  traits are worth  measuring  as well as the 
establishment  of criteria  to be used in selecting  bulls for use in artificial  
insemination.  An example  of the outcome  from such a review  is provided  by 
the recent  work completed  in New Zealand.
The breeding  objective  for NZ cattle  is to “maximise  the net  farm income  
per kg of dry matter".  The main  considerations  are the income  from  milk  - fat 
protein,  lactose,  water  and minerals  - income  from meat balanced  against  the 
feed requirements  for production,  replacements  and maintenance.  In this way 
a “Breeding  Worth ” has been  established  as the main selection  criteria  for NZ 
cattle  of all breeds.  A novel  aspect  of this index  is that it allows  comparisons  
across  breeds.
By including  “survival ” as a trait in the index,  account  can be taken  of any 
trait which  affects  the time an animal  lasts in the commercial  herd.
Customer  focus
Customer  focus  is a way of summarizing  an organization ’s approach  to the 
development  and provision  of services.  As cattle breeding  in Ireland  moves  
towards  industry  control  there  is a real need  to focus  on the needs  of customers  
who, in the case of dairy breeding,  are dairy farmers.
Commercial  dairy farmers  breed  cows to produce  milk that is eventually  
consumed  by a wide range of customers.  The main issue for dairy breeding  
is one of providing  farmers  with cattle  that enable  increased  efficiency  of milk  
production  and/or  improved  returns  from milk and meat sales. With genetics  
playing  such an important  role in determining  milk composition  and 
characteristic  there are opportunities  for increasing  returns  by altering  milk  
composition.  As the new genetic  technologies  develop  it is likely  that further  
opportunities  will emerge  in the future,  that is, by focusing  on the needs  of the 
customers  for milk we may be able to increase  farmer  income.
Equally  important  is the relationship  between  the Irish Cattle  Breeding  
Federation  and its members  organisations  with dairy farmers.  We must focus  
on providing  services  to farmers  which  are profitable  to the average  as well 
as the individual.  These  services  need to be valued  by farmers  to the extent  
that they are happy  to pay for them.
Some  of the implications  of a customer  focused  approach  to servicing  are:
• Services  would  be developed  to meet the needs  of farmers.
• The role of farmers  in determining  the direction  of cattle breeding  will 
increase.
• Government  will have a reducing  influence  on cattle breeding  services.
Customer  focus  is thus integral  to the working  of the Irish Cattle  Breeding
Federation.
Efficiency
There  are opportunities  for greater  efficiency  in cattle  breeding  in Ireland.  
Efficiencies  can be obtained  by:
45
• Increasing  the scale  of operation  so that fixed  overhead  costs  can be spread  
over a greater  volume  of business.  Just as larger  farms enjoy economies  of 
scale  so do cattle  breeding  organizations.  As a general  rule it is more  efficient  
to have  one organisation  than two performing  the same  functions  and covering  
the same number  of customers.  Cattle  breeding  has significant  overheads  
associated  with databases,  progeny  testing,  research  and product  development.  
With  larger  customer  bases  and greater  volumes  of business  it is easier  to carry  
these overheads.
• It is essential  that duplication  be removed.  Examples  of duplication  within  
Irish  cattle  breeding,  the removal  of which  would  result  in cost  reductions  include  
the two linear  assessment  systems  and  the databases  created  by CIMRA  (Central  
Irish Milk Recording  Authority)  and the Department  of Agriculture.
• All of the work  being  undertaken  needs  to be adding  value.  A close look  
at all costs needs  to be undertaken  to ensure  they add value.  For example,  in 
New Zealand  4 or 5 tests per lactation  is considered  adequate  for breeding  
purposes.  What  value is added  by the extra 4 or 5 tests per herd in Ireland?
• The rapid  developments  in information  technology  provide  opportunities  
to use automation  to reduce  costs. Equally  there are developments  in semen  
technology  which  enable  greater  use of high index bulls.
A focus  on efficiency  is one of the priorities  for Irish cattle  breeding  in the 
future.  Here are a couple  of illustrations  of the extent  to which  New Zealand  
was successful  in achieving  increased  efficiency.
The first example  comes  from  artificial  insemination.  This  comparison  shows
Comparative  Costs  of Artificial  
Insemination

46
the average  cost to farmers  of artificial  insemination  per pregnancy  in several  
countries  including  Ireland.
The results  are expressed  in Irish £ and are based  on figures  collected  over  
the last two years. While  herd  size can explain  some  of the difference,  economies  
of scale,  removal  of duplication  and use of appropriate  technology  also  explains  
a large part.

The second  example  comes  from Milk Recording.  Table 1 shows  in Irish  
£ (converted  at £0.40  to $NZ 1.00) the current  charges  for milk recording  on 
the most commonly  used system  in NZ. The highlighted  row is the average  
herd size in New Zealand.  Note that charges  per cow per year vary according  
to herd size and number  ot tests. The average  paid per farmer  is much  lower  
than  in Ireland.  The herds  are larger,  the system  utilizes  farmer  labour  for sample  
collection  and a wide range of options  are available.
The Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation  is initiating  a project  to find less 
expensive  milk  recording  options  for Ireland.  The project  will focus  on reducing  
the costs associated  with determining  milk volume  and sample  collection.  If 
a less expensive  system  can be found  and demonstrated  to be practical  you can 
expect  to see it introduced  in Ireland  in the future.
In conclusion:
The Irish Cattle  breeding  industry  has committed  itself to a process  of 
improvement  with some of the immediate  goals being to:
• Increase  the collaboration  between  organisations.
• Implement  a cattle breeding  database  which  will be shared  by the cattle  
breeding  organisations.
• Improvements  to the animal  evaluation  systems.
• An increased  customer  focus.
• Greater  efficiency.

Genetic  Selection  for Higher  Milk  
Yield: Opportunities  to Use Energy  
Balance,  Feed Intake  and Liveweight*.

Introduction
Most  dairy cattle  breeding  schemes  world-wide  have had a dramatic  effect  
on the productivity  of cows  in many  countries  in the last few decades.  However,  
there  has always  been concern  about  the suitability  of these  breeding  schemes  
to produce  cows that perform  on a grass-based  diet. To date, however,  there  
is convincing  evidence  (from  experimental  herds,  e.g. Langhill  and Moorepark,  
and from larger  population  studies  e.g. Cromie  et al. 1997)  that high genetic  
merit  animals  outperform  their low genetic  merit  counterparts  in most  feeding  
systems,  at least  in terms  of production.  More  of a problem  for grass  orientated  
systems  is that high genetic  merit animals  have, on average,  poorer  fertility  
across  feeding  systems  (Figure  1). The question  of whether  these effects  on 
fertility  are exacerbated  on grass based  systems  or low concentrate  systems  is 
yet unanswered.  The challenge  is clearly  to select  high producing  animals  that 
maintain  their  fertility  in all feeding  systems.  That  enough  of these  animals  are 
around  is shown  in Figure  1, and hence  there is scope  for genetic  selection  to 
improve  both fertility  and yield.
The potential  role that energy  balance  might  play hereby, are currently  under  
investigation  at ID-DLO  in Lelystad.  The aim of this paper  is to outline  some

recent  information  on the heritability  of energy  balance  and how it interacts  
with selection  for milk production,  feed intake  and liveweight.
Heritability
That the amount  of food eaten by a cow, bodyweight,  energy  balance  and 
condition  score  are not only affected  by the feeding  systems  but are heritable  
also, is less well understood.  Heritability  estimates  from our data in Lelystad  
demonstrate  this again (Table  1). Heritabilities  for all traits are close to 0.5, 
which  means  that about  50% of differences  between  cows can be explained  
by their genetic  background.  Hence,  using  genetic  selection  alone,  cows can 
become  heavier  or lighter  or, more  importantly,  cows  can be selected  to have  
a more or less negative  energy  balance  during  early lactation.

Heritability  for milk yield,  liveweight,  dry matter  intake  and energy  balance,  
and heritable  association  (i.e. genetic  correlation)  between  these traits.
Genetic  correlations

Milk production 0.48
Liveweight 0.54 0.31
Dry matter  intake 0.62 0.48 0.75
Energy  balance 0.51 -0.46 0.29 0.55
(‘t Gen experimental  farm, Oldenbroek  et al. 1997)
Genetic  associations  between  traits
Also important  are the genetic  correlations  between  traits,  which  can range  
from  -1 to +1. This  is because  the correlations  indicate  the association  between  
traits and how they respond  together  to genetic  selection.  For example,  from  
Table  1 it can be seen that selection  for milk  production  alone  results  in a higher  
dry matter  intake  (because  the correlation  is 0.48)  and a more  negative  energy  
balance  because  the correlation  is -0.46.
Another  important  conclusion  that can be drawn  is that selection  on anyone  
of the traits  in Table  1 will affect  changes  in almost  all of the other  traits  (because  
all correlations  are different  from  0). This makes  genetic  selection  to improve  
feed efficiency  more  complex.  This is because  what  might  be perceived  to be 
gained  by accounting  for one of the traits, might  in fact be lost because  the 
others  are changed  in a negative  way. A clear example  is that selection  for a 
lighter  cow might  give a perceived  advantage  (because  the lower  maintenance  
costs associated  with smaller  cows),  but selection  for a lower  liveweight  will 
result  in a more negative  energy  balance  also (Table  1).
Energy  balance
In Table 1 it can be seen that selection  for a higher  milk yield results  in a 
more  negative  energy  balance  also (correlation  -0.46).  Or, on a given  diet, high

genetic  merit  cows  are more  willing  to go in a negative  energy balance  to produce  
milk.  This is not surprising:  the energy  for extra  milk production  has to come  
from  either  eating  more  food  or mobilising  more  body  tissue.  The cow that eats 
most and is still prepared  to be in the most negative  energy  balance  will be 
most productive  in terms of yield.
’T Gen results
The heritability  and the genetic  association  between  traits  have  been  discussed  
above.  The effects  of these genetic  associations  are demonstrated  in Table  2. 
In Table  2 three groups  of animals  have been created:  high, medium  and low 
genetic  merit.  As expected,  milk  yield  increases  with increasing  genetic  merit.  
More  interesting  is the observation  for liveweight.  At calving,  high  genetic  merit  
heifers  are 47 kg heavier  compared  with  the low genetic  merit  animals. However,  
at 100 days in milk  this difference  is reduced  to 13 and 19 kg respectively.  This  
is because  the high genetic  merit  animals  lose weight,  whereas  the others  gain 
weight  in this period.

The production  in terms  of energy  and the calculated  mean  energy  balance  
for the three  groups  is given  in Table  3. The pattern  is as predicted  above:  high  
genetic  merit  cows have a more negative  energy  balance  when fed the same  
diet (unlimited  intake))  as lower  genetic  merit  counterparts.  The  blood  parameters  
also indicate  that high genetic  merit animals  are in a more negative  energy  
balance.
Importance  of energy  balance
The importance  of energy  balance  is demonstrated  in Figure  2; the relationship  
between  energy  balance  and days  till first  heat  is negative.  These  results  support  
other  evidence  that cows  that are in a more  negative  energy  balance  take longer  
to come  in heat. This has obvious  consequences  when  maintaining  a 365-day  
calving  interval  and is economically  important  on grass based  systems.

Conclusions
High genetic  merit  cows have a higher  production  because  they consume  
more  food  and they lose more  body  tissue  during  lactation.  The high  heritability  
for energy  balance  provides  an excellent  opportunity  to improve  energy  balance  
by genetic  selection.  Genetic  improvement  of the energy  balance  might  be a 
good  method  to select  animals  that have a high yield and a good fertility.  The 
best  method  hereto  is under  investigation  currently.  Easier  fertility  management,  
together  with a high milk yield  might  be the benefit.  This might  be particular  
relevant  in grass based feeding  systems,  where  there is less scope to use 
concentrates  to compensate  for a negative  energy  balance  and where  it is 
important  to maintain  a 365 day calving  interval.

Prediction  of Animal  Performance  
from Silage  Analyses
R. E. AGNEW
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of Northern  Ireland,  Hillsborough,
Co. Down.
For many  years  dairy  cows  in Ireland  have  been  managed  using  a ‘blueprint ’ 
approach  for a particular  system.  In such  methods  we think  of the average  cow,  
under  average  grazing  conditions,  with average  sward  quality  and we design  
management  systems  around  this. We must recognise  that the use of such  
systems,  supported  by well-targeted  research,  has moved  the industry  to its 
present  very competitive  position.  While  this ‘blueprint ’ approach  has served  
us well in the past it has a number  of shortfalls  in relation  to how we should  
feed and manage  cows  in the next 10 - 15 years.  Up to the  present  the penalties  
have not been great  if the feeding  and management  of the cows has not been  
correct,  but all this is changing  very rapidly  due to changes  in performance  
potential  of our dairy cows.
The rate of genetic  improvement  in the dairy herd in the United  Kingdom  
and the Republic  of Ireland  to 1985 was relatively  slow, approximately  0 to 
0.5% per year. More  recently,  however,  there has been a marked  increase  in 
the rate of genetic  improvement,  with Lindberg  et al. (1998)  reporting  the rate 
of genetic  gain in milk  fat plus protein  yield  as 2.2%  per year,  during  the period  
1990-1994.  The main  effect  of increasing  genetic  merit  is that a greater  proportion  
of food energy  is partitioned  to milk production,  with less energy  partitioned  
towards  body reserves  i.e. to body condition.  For example,  research  at 
Hillsborough  indicates  that high merit cows (RBI95  138 approx.)  produced  
12.8%  more  milk and yet only consumed  6% extra  dry matter  compared  to low 
merit  cows  (RBI^,  100 approx.).  This  major  increase  in yield  with  only marginal  
increases  in intake  means  that efficiency  of conversion  of feed into milk  
(energetic  efficiency)  is greater  with high merit  cows.  However,  more  detailed  
studies  showed  that there were no differences  in the partial  efficiency  of use 
of energy  for milk production  between  high and low merit  cows.  The net result  
was that the high merit  cows  lost weight  through  lactation  while  the low merit  
cows  gained  weight.  The long-term  production,  health  and welfare  implications  
associated  with  this loss of body  condition  obviously  presents  a major  challenge  
in dairying  systems.  This  could  be particularly  important  in systems  with a high 
reliance  on either  grazed  or conserved  grass.
In this era of increasing  genetic  merit of dairy cows and a wide range in 
the genetic  merits  of cows on individual  farms  there is an urgent  need to re­
examine  our approaches  to feeding  the dairy cow.  The future  key must  be getting  
greater  precision  into feeding.  We must  ensure  that our feed rationing  systems  
are appropriate  for the high levels  of performance  that can now be achieved  
if we are to ensure  that our cows  survive  and produce  for long  productive  lives
52
in our herds.  Research  must  provide  the manager  with  sound  and reliable  decision  
support  systems  which  will aid the complex  decision  making  processes  which  
are involved  in managing  these  high merit  cows.  While  in the past considerable  
effort  has been expended  in relation  to feeding  cows to meet the short term  
economics  of our systems,  there  is no doubt  that in the long term we must  also 
embrace  the biological  needs of our animals  to produce,  remain  healthy  and 
achieve  appropriate  reproductive  targets.
In order to develop  these aspects  this paper  will briefly  review:
(a) current  information  on the feed (energy)  requirements  of dairy  cows  with  
particular  reference  to recent  research  at Agricultural  Research  Institute  of 
Northern  Ireland  and
(b) the recent  programme  which  has enabled  near infrared  reflectance  
spectroscopy  (NIRS)  to become  a powerful  tool in feed characterisation.
The paper  will also outline  how these two components  have been brought  
together  to enable  the Hillsborough  Feeding  Information  System  and associated  
beef and dairy cattle  rationing  programs  to be developed.
Background  to energy  nutrition  of dairy  cows
Within the United  Kingdom  the amount  of dietary  energy required  to support  
the maintenance  and productive  demands  of ruminant  livestock  is estimated  
in terms of metabolizable  energy  (ME) with diets being  formulated  to meet  
these  requirements  according  to the ME content  of the individual  components.  
The ME rather  than Net Energy  system  is therefore  the baseline  for this paper.

Figure  1 - Schematic  representation  of dietary  ME use in the dairy  cow.
53
Feed  energy  use by the dairy  cow is represented  schematically  in Figure  1. 
Cows require  energy  for maintenance,  milk production,  liveweight  gain and 
pregnancy.  In our present  feeding  approaches,  these are estimated  separately  
and then added  together  to give an estimate  of the cow ’s total energy  
requirements.  While  there  is considerable  debate  about  the simplistic  approach  
of attributing  energy  requirements  into these specific  compartments  in reality  
there is no other useful  approach  to formulating  diets. The key components  
which  are therefore  necessary  in ration formulation  are the maintenance  
requirement  (ME^)  and the efficiencies  with which  the remaining  energy  is 
converted  to milk energy  (k.) or body gain (k^).
Estimating  energy  requirements
The estimates  of maintenance  energy  requirement  and the efficiencies  of 
ME use for milk production  and liveweight  gain used in today ’s ME feed 
rationing  systems  (AFRC,  1990 and 1993) were based on classical  energy  
metabolism  studies  undertaken  30-50  years ago using very different  animals  
and diets  to those  in use today.  However,  there  is an increasing  body  of evidence  
to suggest  that total energy  requirements  calculated  by using  this route  are not 
relevant  to many of the situations  which  presently  exist.
Over  a large number  of studies  (calorimetry  and feeding  studies)  when  we 
have fed animals  according  to what in theory  they required,  they have been  
on average  losing  weight  at a rate of 0.35 kg/d (Agnew  et al, 1998). It could  
be argued  that the situation  could  be remedied  in current  feeding  standards  by 
increasing  these feeding  standards  (AFRC,  1990)  by around  5%, as in AFRC  
(1993).  This approach  is extremely  simplistic  and it does not identify  which  
component  of requirements  is in error. It rather  assumes  that all components  
are equally  in error. Diets must now be formulated  for cows across  an ever 
increasing  range  of milk outputs  and where  the error lies has therefore  major  
implications  for how we feed animals  at opposing  ends of the production  scale.  
For these  reasons  it is important  that we develop  a more  accurate  approach  to 
feeding  cows and this has been part of our ongoing  research  programme  at 
Hillsborough.
Current  standards  suggest  that a 600 kg dairy  cow  requires  58 MJ/d  of energy  
to maintain  her body functions  (i.e. maintenance).  Research  at Hillsborough  
suggests  that the dairy cows of today require  75 MJ/d for maintenance  (Yan 
et al, 1997 and 1998),  a figure  which  is approximately  30% higher  than that 
widely  used across  the industry  at present.  In addition,  during  the last number  
of years,  many  researchers  have  suggested  that forage  based  diets  are used less 
efficiently  for milk  production  than the feeding  standards  suggest.  Our research  
indicates  that the feeding  standards  are correct  and energy  is used for milk  
production  with an efficiency  of 0.65 (or 65%).  It is therefore  important  when  
calculating  requirements  of dairy  cattle  that we recognise  these  recent  findings  
and incorporate  them into our approaches  to feeding.
How do cows respond  to extra  feed?
We have  discussed  developing  feeding  standards  which  will enable  the most  
accurate  rationing  of dairy cows. However,  such approaches  are of limited
54
practical  value  in the real world  in which  we must  be able to predict  optimum  
feeding  levels and strategies  for animals  of differing  milk yield potential,  
producing  in a range  of physical  and economic  environments. In this latter  context  
the key factor  is how the animal  responds  to additional  feed. This is primarily  
driven  by how the animal  partitions  that additional  feed between  milk output  
and liveweight  gain.  Only  when  we fully  understand  this partitioning  relationship,  
and how it is influenced  by both animal  and feed factors,  can sensible  feeding  
approaches  be developed.  The question  for researchers  is therefore  to quantify  
those animal  and feed factors  which  influence  partitioning  relationships  and 
to build  these  into a feeding  system  along  with  any new  estimates  of requirements  
which  may come along.
In conclusion,  recent  research  at Hillsborough  has demonstrated  that we 
currently  underfeed  dairy  cows  and the energy  required  to maintain  a dairy  cow 
is some  30% higher  than that in published  feeding  standards.  Having  reviewed  
the animals  requirements  and indicated  how  we consider  these  to be very  different  
to that normally  accepted,  we must  now  turn to examine  methods  to characterise  
feeds.
Characterisation  of grass silage
Grass  silage  is the main  component  of winter  diets for ruminants  and more  
accurate  rationing  can only be acjiieved  if methods  are available  for;
(a) predicting  the feeding  value  and intake  potential  of the silages  which  form  
the basis of the winter  diet, and
(b) enabling  the most  appropriate  level  and type of supplement  to be matched  
to the silage  to achieve  pre-set  animal  performance  targets.
Silage  feeding  value  depends  on (a) the nutritive  value  of 1 kg silage  (ME  
concentration)  and (b) the quantity  of silage  the animal  will consume  (intake  
potential).  It must be especially  recognised  however  that the latter is more  
important  than the former  in determining  the feeding  value of a silage.  For 
example,  within  the major  Hillsborough  study  using 136 silages,  ME content  
ranged  from 9.8 to 13.5 MJ/kg  DM (ratio 1:1.4)  while  intake  ranged  from 4.3 
to 10.9 kg/day  (ratio 1:2.5)  (Steen  et al., 1998).  Accurate  prediction  of both  
intake  and ME  concentration  (digestibility)  of a silage  are both  therefore  essential  
pre-requisites  to the effective  rationing  of dairy cows and beef cattle  offered  
grass silage  ad libitum.
The Hillsborough  Silage  Evaluation  System
While  numerous  other researchers  have attempted  to develop  methods  of 
predicting  silage  intake  from a range  of chemical  parameters  these  have been  
totally  ineffective.  At the onset  of the Hillsborough  programme  it was recognised  
that a system  could  only be developed  if the intake,  digestibility  etc. of a large  
number  of silages,  representing  the range  of types  of silages  across  the industry,  
were characterised  within  a standard  animal  protocol.  As a result,  the study  
involved  selecting  silages  on the basis of their pH, dry matter,  ammonia  and 
metabolizable  energy  contents.  A total of 136 silages  were  selected  on this basis  
from farms  across  Northern  Ireland.  Approximately  seven  tonnes  of each  silage
55
were brought  to the Institute,  mixed  in a mixer  wagon  to achieve  uniformity  
and then stored  in polythene-lined  boxes  until feeding  one to four weeks  later.  
There was no deterioration  of the silages  during  storage  and their chemical  
composition  remained  constant  (Pippard  etal., 1995).  The silages  were  offered  
to 192 individually  fed steers,  which  were  crosses  of the continental  beef  breeds  
and had a mean  initial  live weight  of 415 kg, in a partially-balanced  changeover  
design  experiment  to measure  ad libitum  intake.  Each  silage  was offered  as the 
sole feed to ten animals  for a period  of two weeks.  Eight  silages  were  offered  
in each of 17 periods  and in addition  a further  16 animals  in each period  were  
offered  a standard  hay to enable  variation  in intake  between  different  periods  
to be removed.  Detailed  chemical  and biological  compositions  of the silages  
were determined  including  the use of near infrared  reflectance  spectroscopy  
and electrometric  titration.  All silages  were offered  to sheep  to determine  in 
vivo digestibility.  The rates of disappearance  and rumen  degradabilities  of the 
dry matter,  nitrogen  and fibre fractions  in the 136 silages  were determined  in 
vivo using the in sacco  method.
Thirteen  of the 136 silages  were  also offered  unsupplemented  to dairy  cows  
to provide  a basis  by which  the intake  system  developed  from  the data  produced  
with beef  cattle  could  be translated  for use with  dairy  cows.  In addition,  sixteen  
of the silages  were  offered  to dairy  cows  and growing  beef  cattle  with a range  
of concentrate  types  and levels.  Each  silage  was supplemented  with  high-starch  
and high-fibre  concentrates,  each  with  three  protein  contents  and at three  levels  
of supplementation.  This process  enabled  the examination  of the interactions  
between  silage  type and concentrate  type/level  of supplementation  in terms  of 
their effects  on silage  intake.
Data have been used to develop  relationships  between  individual  chemical  
parameters  of the silages,  or groups  of parameters,  and intake  using  simple  and 
multiple  regression  analyses.  These  have been reported  by Steen and Agnew  
(1996)  and Steen et al. (1998).  Samples  of undried  silages,  and after drying  
for 20 h at 85°C,  were  also scanned  through  a near infrared  spectrophotometer.
Prediction  of intake
Chemical  parameters  (and their combinations)  were of limited  value in 
predicting  the intake  potential  of a silage.  These  relationships  produced  low 
correlation  coefficients.  Near  infrared  reflectance  spectroscopy  was first shown  
to be a rapid method  for predicting  the chemical  composition  of forages  by 
Norris  et al. (1976).  Since then numerous  workers  have explored  the use of 
NIRS  for the prediction  of both  chemical  composition  and digestibility  of grass  
silages.  Attempts  have also been made  to use NIRS to predict  the voluntary  
intake  potential  of forages.  In the present  study  the potential  of NIRS  to predict  
intake  and digestibility  through  scanning  both dried  and undried  samples  was 
explored.  The results  of these  have  been  reported  in detail  by Park  etal. (1997)  
and Gordon  et al. (1998).  This technique  proved  to be by far the best method  
with R^ of 0.89 and 0.94 for intake  and organic  matter  digestibility,  based  on 
dried  silages,  respectively. Calibrations  based  on NIR  spectra  of undried  samples  
of grass silage,  which  had been chopped,  produced  predictions  of intake  and
56
digestibility  with accuracies  similar  to those  achieved  using  NIRS  with dried  
samples.  Table 1 demonstrates  the improvement  in prediction  of OMD  with  
NIRS over other  commonly  used methods.

Subsequent  research  has also produced  accurate  predictive  equations  for a 
wide  range  of chemical  and biological  parameters  of undried  (wet)  silages  which  
are important  in nutritional  terms  to the animal.  This work  is reported  in detail  
by Park et al. (1998).  Examples  are given in Table 2.

This  research  programme  has developed  a rapid,  cheap  and effective  method  
for predicting  a wide  range  of chemical  and biological  parameters  of grass  silage  
for use in dairy  cow, beef  cattle  and sheep  rationing  systems.  This  research  has 
been  widely  recognised  as leading,  world  class  research  and the system  produced,  
based  on near infrared  reflectance  spectroscopy  (NIRS),  is widely  recognised  
to be the best system  currently  available.  These  new methods,  while  not yet 
currently  commercially  available  elsewhere  in the UK or Ireland,  enable  cost 
effective  and accurate  predictions  of a range  of nutritionally important  parameters  
of grass silage.
Development  of nutritional  models
Combining  new information  on feed (energy)  requirements  of both dairy  
and beef cattle,  and an effective  method  of predicting  nutritionally  important  
characteristics  of silage,  led to the development  of the Hillsborough  Feeding  
Information  System,  and an associated  new  beef  cattle  rationing  program.  Work  
is ongoing  on tbe development  of a dairy cow rationing  program.
57
The Hillsborough  Feeding  Information  System  is commercially  available  
to the agricultural  industry  throughout  Ireland.  It uses the latest analytical  
technology  to evaluate  silages  and couples  this to a series  of computer  programs  
to provide  feeding  advice  for dairy cows,  beef  cattle  and sheep.  Commercial  
silage  samples  are accurately  evaluated  in 15 minutes.  The Beef  Cattle  Rationing  
Program,  developed  jointly  between  Agricultural  Research  Institute  of Northern  
Ireland,  Department  of Agriculture  for Northern  Ireland  and Meat  and Livestock  
Commission  is commercially  available  throughout  the UK and Ireland.
Conclusions
Accurate  rationing  of ruminant  animals  depends  upon accurately  knowing  
the animals ’ nutrient  requirements  for differing  functions  and having  effective  
laboratory  methods  for predicting  the characteristics  of forages.  Research  has 
demonstrated  that the present  estimates  adopted  for maintenance  in cattle  are 
well below  those necessary  for animals  on forage  based  diets. These  new 
estimates  for maintenance  coupled  with the results  of a large scale study to 
develop  improved  methods  of predicting  intake  and digestibility  of grass  silage  
have  enabled  much  more  accurate  feed rationing  programmes  to be developed.  
These  developments,  which  will be further  refined  over  time,  represent  a major  
step forward  in accurately  rationing  ruminant  livestock.

New Energy  and Protein  Systems  for 
Ruminants
F. P. O’MARA  
University  College  Dublin.
Energy  is the most important  nutrient  for animals,  followed  by protein.  
Animals  must  be properly  fed with energy  and protein  in order  to achieve  the 
desired  performance.  To assist  in this, systems  have  been  developed  for protein  
and energy  feeding.  These  all allow  the dietary  supply  of energy/protein  and 
the animal  requirements  of energy/protein  to be assessed  and matched.  Some  
recent  developments  in energy  and protein  systems  for ruminants  are outlined  
in this paper.
Historical  perspective  and current  situation  in Ireland  and 
internationally
For ruminants,  the early energy  systems  such as those  devised  by Kellner  
(1905)  in Europe  and Armsby  (1917)  in the USA were based  on net energy.  
In 1962, a system  based  on metabolisable  energy  was proposed  in the UK by 
Blaxter  (1962).  To my knowledge,  Ireland,  Switzerland,  and Finland  are the 
only European  countries  to have  adopted  the ME approach.  The major  livestock  
producing  countries  of France,  Germany  and the Netherlands  all opted  to keep  
the net energy  approach  and have developed  modern  net energy  systems.  The 
ME system  can be criticised  on theoretical  and practical  grounds.  Some  Irish  
scientists,  most  notably  my colleagues  in University  College  Dublin  have  voiced  
their criticisms  (e.g. Caffrey,  1993).  I joined  UCD in 1993 to work on these  
energy  systems  under  the sponsorship  of the Irish Grain  & Feed  Association.  
I reached  the same conclusion  that net energy  would  be a better  basis of feed 
evaluation  than ME. That  project  culminated  in the publication  of a net energy  
system  (O’Mara,  1996)  which  was modelled  on the French  net energy  system.  
Using  Irish data (mainly  Teagasc),  a set of net energy  values  as specific  as 
possible  to Irish feeds  was generated  and adjustments  were  made  to the animal  
requirements  for growth  and fattening  to bring them into line with the levels  
of performance  obtained  here  in Ireland. In this paper  I outline  the considerations,  
theoretical  and practical,  that  justify  the use of NE instead  of ME and to outline  
the system  we have devised.
On the protein  side, crude  protein  has long been recognised  as inadequate  
for ruminants.  Terms  like undegradable  protein  (UDP)  and rumen  degradable  
protein  (RDP)  for many years were attempts  to better  describe  feed protein.  
More  comprehensive  systems  have  been  developed  in France  (the PDI system)  
and the UK (the MP system). Recently  the Dutch  evaluated  which  of the existing  
systems  could  best be used under  Dutch  conditions  (Van Straalen  et al., 1993)  
and concluded  that the French  PDI system  was the most  accurate  in predicting  
milk protein  production.  I will illustrate  later how the PDI system  would  rate 
our typical  grass silage  based  diets.

What  is metabolisable  energy  and net energy?
Of the energy  which  the animal  digests  (i.e., after losses  in faeces  are 
deducted),  some is lost as methane  and some is excreted  in the urine. The 
remaining  energy  is called  the metabolisable  energy  (ME).  It is an abstract  term  
and cannot  be measured  directly  - it is measured  indirectly  by measuring  losses  
in faeces,  methane  and urine,  and deducting  these from total or gross  energy.  
The metabolisable  energy  is available  to the animal  for maintenance  and animal  
products  such as milk, meat  and wool,  but it is not used with 100%  efficiency  
- some is lost as heat:
ME X k = NE
where  k is an efficiency  factor  which  is very poorly  understood.  So net energy  
(NE)  is the energy  used to maintain  the animal  or which  is recovered  in animal  
product.  It can be measured  indirectly  by measuring  heat loss (very difficult)  
and subtracting  this from  ME or measured  directly  by measuring  animal  product  
and measuring  or in most cases,  estimating  maintenance  requirements.  This  
allows  net energy  values  to be derived  from or tested  and validated  by animal  
production  studies.
The advantages  of a net energy  system
The main advantage  of a NE system  is that the feed values  are inherently  
more realistic  as guides  to the usefulness  of the feeds than ME values.  This  
can be explained  as follows:
• As stated  above, NE values  can be derived  from  or can be tested  and validated  
by animal  production  studies  which  have  been  carried  out in Ireland.  Values  
so derived  must  be more  meaningful  than ME values  measured  in sheep  fed 
at maintenance  which  the ME system  uses.
• NE ranks feeds on the basis of animal  performance  and thus allows  
comparisons  of the productive  value of different  feeds but ME values  are 
not necessarily  related  to animal  maintenance  or production.  For instance,  
it takes about 12 MJ of ME from good quality  forage  and 14 MJ of ME 
from  poor  quality  forage  to equal  the 11 MJ of ME in 1 kg of barley  in terms  
of value  for animal  production.  In other  words,  the usefulness  of ME depends  
on where  it comes  from. Obviously  ME should  not to used to compare  the 
energy  value of concentrates  and forages.
• ME values  as they have evolved  have no intrinsic  value over DE values  
because,  (a) they are generally  measured  at maintenance  feeding  level  where  
there is a very close  relationship  between  DE and ME, (b) methane  energy  
is usually  predicted  in measurements  of ME, (c) the relationship  between  
ME at maintenance  and ME at production  level is variable,  depending  
on both the physiological  state  of the animal  and the feed,  and (d) no attempt  
is made  to segregate  urine into animal  derived  and food derived  products.
• While  NE systems  may predict  NE from DE or ME values,  the NE values  
so derived  can be adjusted  to reconcile  them with measured  animal  
performance  if necessary.  This is a vital element  of the Irish net 
energy  system.  An ME based  system  of feed evaluation  has no such ‘safety  
mechanism ’.
61
Net energy  for Ireland?
In UCD  we have  taken  the view  that we should  be using  an NE based  system  
instead  of an ME based  system  for feed evaluation  in Ireland.  This view is not 
taken likely considering  the close links we have with the UK and Northern  
Ireland.  However,  we believe  that the points  above  are compelling  reasons  for 
change  - if NE is a better  basis for feed evaluation,  we should  be using it 
regardless  of the difficulty  of unlearning  the ME system  and learning  a new 
system  with new terminology,  values,  etc. Our own system  gives us the 
independence  to put our values  on feeds  in an organised  and structured  manner.  
Teagasc  and UCD  have carried  out (and continue  to do so) a huge amount  of 
feed evaluation  work.  What  is the point  of all that if the results  are not used?  
The easiest  way to harness  the information  generated  is in a net energy  system  
of our own. As new information  on feeds  becomes  available  from home  and 
abroad,  this can be incorporated  by updating  the feed values.  The silage  intake  
values  predicted  by the Hillsborough  NIR calibration  are well suited  to 
incorporation  into the French  intake  system  (which  won ’t be dealt  with in this 
paper).  The net energy  system  can easily  accommodate  any developments  in 
the ME approach  since  the fundamental  objective  in all systems  is that the value  
attributable  to a feed can be used to accurately  predict  the value  of that feed 
to the animal.
Outline  of the recently  proposed  Irish net energy  system
The NE systems  developed  for use in Ireland  are mainly  based  on the French  
NE systems  (Jarrige,  1989).  The French  systems  have been chosen  for many  
reasons
• They  are very  comprehensive  and are backed  up by a huge  amount  of animal  
experimentation.
• Systems  of production  and animal  types in France  are reasonably  similar  
to those in Ireland.
• Their  feed  database  includes information  on several  hundred  feedstuffs,  based  
on thousands  of in vivo measurements.
• The net energy  values  are all expressed  relative  to barley  as a standard  feed 
which  makes  the values  more  meaningful  to farmers  than  abstract  megajoules.
• The French  also have well developed  protein  and intake  systems  (the PDI 
and Fill Unit systems,  respectively)  which  have been combined  with their  
energy  systems  and feed database  in a computer  operated  diet formulation  
package  (INRAtion)  which  is available  in English.  Together,  these  systems  
provide  an excellent  “conceptual  framework ” for designing  feeding  programs.  
The Irish net energy  systems  differ  from the French  systems  mainly  in the
nutrient  values  of the feedstuffs.  The nutrient  values  are based  as much  as possible  
on Irish data. This ranges  from data on the chemical  composition  of the feeds,  
measurements  of their in vivo digestibility,  and measurement  of animal  
performance  in comparative  feeding  trials.  Thus,  the feed tables  are related  to 
the feeds used in Ireland  and the use of feeding  experiments  in deriving  the 
net energy  values  is important  in ensuring  that they are the best available  values.
62
The aim has been to provide  values  that reflect  animal  performance  as closely  
as possible  and thus, to give accurate  feed evaluation.
Expressing  energy  value  as feed units
The NE systems  for dairy and beef  cattle  and sheep  assign  two NE values  
to the feedstuffs,  one for maintenance  and lactation  in dairy cattle  and sheep,  
and one for maintenance  and weight  gain in fattening  animals.  The energy  
requirements  of animals  are expressed  in the same  units.  The values  proposed  
for use in Ireland  are followed  by (I) to distinguish  them from corresponding  
French  values.  The NE of a feed for maintenance  and lactation  are expressed  
in the same units called  UFL (Unite  Fourragere  Lait - Feed Unit for Milk)  in 
the French  system  and UFL(I)  in the Irish Republic.  UFL(I)  values  for some  
feedstuffs  are given in Table 1.
One UFL(I)  is the NE content  of 1 kg of 
for milk productionair dry standard  barley
Table 1

Sunflower  meal, CF > 30% 0.59
Rapeseed  meal 0.88
Grass silage,  70 DMD 0.79 (DM basis)
Spring  grass 0.95 (DM basis)
For intensive  beef  production,  tbe overall  NE value  for meat  production  of 
the feedstuffs  at an animal  production  level (APL)  of 1.5 times  maintenance
is used.  This is expressed  in units  called  UFV  (Unite  Fourragere  Viande  - Feed  
Unit for Meat)  in the French  system  and UFV(I)  in the Irish Republic.
One UFV  is the NE content  of 1 kg of air dry standard  barley
for meat  production  at an APL of 1.5
An APL of 1.5 corresponds  approximately  to a daily weight  gain of 1 kg/ 
day in finishing  steers.
Net energy  requirements  are expressed  in the same  units,  UFL(I)  and UFV(I),  
as feedstuff  NE content,  and are treated  as being additive.  Requirements  
expressed  in UFL(I)  are;
63
• the requirements  of dairy  cows  (or sheep)  during  lactation,  pregnancy  or the 
dry period,
• the requirements  of dairy heifers  (or ewe lambs),  wintering  and slowly  
growing  animals  (i.e., liveweight  gain between  0 and 1.0 kg/d for growing  
cattle),
• breeding  males.
Requirements  expressed  in UFV(I)  are:
• the requirements  of rapidly  growing  and fattening  animals  (steers,  bulls,  beef  
heifers  and fattening  lambs).
Standard  barley
Barley  is used as the reference  feedstuff  in the French  NE system  and in 
this system.  It is defined  by Jarrige  (1989)  as being  the average  composition  
of barley  samples  analysed  in France  between  1977  and 1987:  87.0%  dry matter  
(DM),  4.36%  crude  fibre  (CF), 10.5%  crude  protein  (CP), 1.93%  ether  extract  
(EE), organic  matter  digestibility  (OMD)  = 0.86 and energy  digestibility  = 
0.837.  The OMD  is very similar  to the average  of samples  (n = 8) analysed  
in UCD  from 1994  to 1996.  The OMD  of the Irish samples  was slightly  lower  
(0.849)  but the DE content  of the eight  samples  (15.6 MJ/kg  DM) is exactly  
the same  as the French  value.  Because  the reference  feeds in both systems  are 
so similar,  UFL  and UFV  values  from  the French  system  can be used for feeds  
where  no specific  Irish values  are available.
Why do we need a set of Irish feed values?
The  French  have  carried  out thousands  of in vivo  measurements  on feedstuffs  
in developing  their  comprehensive  database.  So have  the Dutch  and the British.  
Are we re-inventing  the wheel  or being  nationalistic  by setting  out to have  our 
own values?  The answer  is no because  feeds  can differ  depending  on the region  
in which  they are produced.  This is easiest  to visualise  with forages  where  
varieties  and climatic  conditions  will combine  to produce  material  of different

quality in different  countries.  However,  with  concentrate  feeds which  are largely  
imported  except  for home  produced  cereals,  the quality  of material  imported  
into Ireland  could  differ  markedly  from  that imported  by some  of our neighbours.  
This is illustrated  in Table  2 which  shows  the organic  matter  digestibility  of 
various  feedstuffs  as given in the Irish, UK and French  databases.  The Irish  
data are measurements  of digestibility  carried  out at UCD over the past four 
years.  The methodology  used in all three countries  was similar.
The data show similar  results  for many feeds such as barley,  wheat,  beet 
pulp, citrus  pulp, and soyabean  meal but they also show  substantial  variation  
in the quality  of other  feedstuffs  between  countries.  Both the UK and France  
report  much  higher  digestibility  for corn gluten  than we have  measured  at UCD.  
The French  values  for palm kernel  and rapeseed  meal are much higher  than 
our measurements  and the UK value for pollard  (wheat  middlings)  is much  
higher  than our measurements.  These  differences  may reflect  differences  in the 
grades  of materials  imported  by each country  or they may be due to changes  
in the quality  of the by-product  over  time  as the manufacturing  processes  become  
more efficient.  This reduced  quality  would  be picked  up in the Irish values  
because  these  have all been generated  in the last four years but not in the UK 
or French  data which  is much  older.  Regardless  of the reason,  they do establish  
the need to have our own figures  on these feedstuffs.
Does the new energy  system  affect  the value  of feeds
It is common  practice  to value  feeds  in relation  to barley  and soyabean  meal  
as two reference  feeds  and to take into account  the energy  and protein  contents.  
Table  3 shows  the UFL(I),  ME and CP contents  of barley  and soyabean  meal,  
and a third feed, corn gluten,  whose  value we want to ascertain.  The price of 
barley  is taken  as £ 100/tonne  and the price  of soyabean  meal  is taken  as £230/  
tonne.  Using  the ME and CP values,  corn gluten  will have a value  of £131.48.  
However,  using  the UFL(I)  and CP values,  its value  is only £115.84.  Therefore  
the systems  we use have a large effect  on the value  we give a feed. Using  the 
ME values,  we would  consider  corn gluten  to be good value  at less than £131/  
tonne,  but it is actually  poor value at anything  more than £115/tonne  when  
considered  using the new energy  systems.
Table 3

Barley 1.00 11,2 10.4 100
Soyabean  meal 1.02 11.5 16.8 230
Com gluten 0.92 10.9 19.8 ?
Farmers  who  do not buy straights  might  think  this point  is irrelevant  to them.  
But a compounder  using  ME and CP as the basis  for his formulations  will use 
more  com gluten  to the exclusion  of other  better  value  ingredients.  The effects
65
on concentrate  cost or quality  will not be huge,  but on a national  scale  I consider  
them significant.
Evaluating  forages
The energy  value  of forages  is given  in UFL(I)  per kg DM and is obviously  
very important  in determining  their feeding  value.  However  intake  is also an 
extremely  important  consideration  with forages.  The French  have published  
Fill Value  figures  for the voluntary  intake  of forages  relative  to that of spring  
grass  (which  is considered  the standard  forage).  For dairy  cows,  these  are given  
in lactating  fill units (LFU).  The higher  the value,  the lower  the intake.  Spring  
grass  is given  a value  of 1 and first cut grass  silage  might  have a value  of 1.27 
(i.e. 27% lower  than grass)  whereas  good quality  maize  silage  might  have a 
value of 1.13 (i.e. 13% lower  than grass).
An index  of the overall  feeding  value  of forages  would  be very useful  which  
would  take into account  its energy  content  and its intake  potential.  Again,  the 
French  have such an index  which  is called  the Ration  Energy  Density  (RED).  
The RED of a forage  is obtained  as follows:
RED = energy  content  (UFL(I)/kg  DM 
Fill Value  (LFU)
The higher  the RED,  the higher  the overall  feeding  value  of the forage.  Table  
4 shows  the energy  content,  the intake  capacity  and the RED of some  forages.  
These  are average  figures  and obviously  both the energy  content  and intake  
capacity  of individual  batches  will vary. Energy  content  can be predicted  from  
DMD  and recent  Hillsborough  work has made it possible  to get a Fill Value  
for a particular  batch  of silage.  The figures  in Table  4 show  the superiority  of 
grass to grass silage  and the superiority  of maize  silage  to grass silage.  This  
is mainly  due to its better  Fill Value  rather  than to a higher  energy  content.

and Feed Value (UFL)  into account
The PDI protein  system
The PDI system  aims to predict  the quantity  of amino  acids the cow will 
absorb  from  her diet. This can be limited  by either  nitrogen  or energy availability
66
in the rumen  which  are used in the production  of microbial  protein.  Energy  
is assessed  by the amount  of fermentable  organic  matter  available.  Thus,  there  
are two potential  amounts  of microbial  protein  production,  that from  available  
nitrogen  or that from available  fermentable  organic  matter.  The supply  of 
undegradable  protein  is added  to this giving  two potential  supplies of total amino  
acids:
PDIN  = PDI supply  when  degraded  dietary  N is limiting  
PDIE  = PDI supply  when  fermentable  organic  matter  is limiting
The supply  of each from the diet is calculated  and the lower  one is used  
as the actual supply  of amino  acids to the cow (the ideal situation  is where  
PDIN  = PDIE in the complete  diet, but this is not always  achievable).  The 
simplified  examples  below  demonstrate  the calculations  involved.  The following  
feeds, shown  with their respective  PDIE and PDIN  values,  are used.

PDIN  supply  = {(11 X 78) + (4 x 79) + (1 x 388)} = 1562 g/d 
PDIE supply  = {(11 X 62) + (4 x 102) + (1 x 263)} = 1353 g/d 
PDIE  < PDIN,  and so PDIE  is chosen  - i.e., PDI supply  = 1353 g/d. This is 
adequate  for a cow producing  21-22  kg milk at 30 g/kg protein  (Table  5).
Situation  B If the cow is eating  6.5 kg grass silage  DM, 6.5 kg maize  silage  
DM, 3 kg beet pulp DM and 1 kg of soyabean  meal DM
PDIN  supply={(6.5  x 78)-i-(6.5  x 50)+(3  x 66)-i-(l  x 388)}=1418  g/d 
PDIE  supply={(6.5  x 62)-i-(6.5  x 68)-(-(3  x 109)4-(1  x 263)}=1435  g/d 
PDIN  < PDIE,  and so PDIN  is chosen  - i.e., PDI supply  = 1418 g/d. This is 
adequate  for a cow producing  22-23  kg milk at 30 g/kg protein  (Table  5), with  
1 kg less concentrates  than when fed grass silage  only (situation  A).

With grass  silage  based  diets fed to milking  cows,  PDIE  is usually  limiting  
and the target  level in concentrates  is 125-130  g/kg as fed. This is difficult  to 
achieve.  Table  6 shows  the PDIE,  PDIN  and CP contents  of some  formulations.  
Formulation  1 is a simple  3 way mix of barley,  corn gluten  and distillers  grains.  
Formulations  2 and 3 use a larger  number  of ingredients.  Rapeseed  meal is the 
main protein  source  in 2 and high quality  cottonseed  meal is the main source  
in 3. All three are seriously  inadequate  in PDIE,  even though  all are between  
18 and 20% CP. This indicates  that with many  rations  of ‘normal ’ CP content,  
protein  nutrition  of the dairy cow is inadequate.
Formulations  4 shows  the inclusion  rate of soyabean  meal that would  be 
needed  to bring a concentrate  up to a PDIE  level of approximately  130 g/kg  
where  barley  is the only other  ingredient.  It is 30%. It is apparent  that it will 
be difficult  to design  concentrates  with 130 g/kg PDIE  or greater  which  implies  
that high milk protein  content  will be difficult  to achieve.  Formulation  5 is a 
typical concentrate  fed as a balancer  to maize  silage, being  24% CP. It is adequate  
in both PDIE  and PDIN.  This is most  likely  a contributing  factor  to the better  
milk protein  contents  on maize  silage  based  diets along with the higher  DM 
intakes.

Summary  and conclusions
Irish farmers  would  be better  served  by an energy  system  which  puts values  
on feeds  that reflects  animal  performance  on those  feeds.  It is wasteful  of Irish  
research  results  not to use them in a systematic  manner  to put values  on feeds.  
A net energy  system  is the obvious  vehicle  for this. We should  exercise  control  
over our own feed values.  Using  our knowledge  to put the best value we can 
on feeds  is essential  to getting  the best return  from  the huge  annual  expenditure  
on feedstuffs.  We need a vibrant  system  that is updated  as new information  
arises and we need to utilise  developments  abroad  such as the silage  intake  
prediction  from Hillsborough.  Newer  concepts  of protein  nutrition  also need  
to be taken on board.

International  Trends  in Dairying

As the debate  on the future  of milk production  in Europe  was intensifying,  
I examined  the dairy industry  in several  parts of the world  to see how people  
viewed  the future  of the industry  from  other  perspectives  and what  impact  this 
may  have  on the future  of Irish  production.  My study  tour  in 1996  was sponsored  
by the Farmers ’ Journal  and the Irish Farmers ’ Association.  The major  milk  
exporting  areas  were  of most  relevance. I visited  the US, then  Victoria  in Australia  
and continuing  to Chile,  Argentina  and Uruguay.
As shown  below,  world  milk production  has decreased  slightly  from 475 
m tonnes  in 1988 to 473 m tonnes  in 1996.  The largest  drop in production  is 
in the E.U. with Eastern  Europe  and Russia  also reducing.  Most other parts  
of the world are increasing  production  and developing  new markets  in the 
growing  economies  of Asia and Latin  America.  Milk consumption  in Brazil  
has increased  by 20% in the last 2-3 years and it is considered  that half of 
Brazil ’s 130 m people  have not tasted  dairy products  yet.

U.S.A.
In visiting  10 different  states,  I got some  appreciation  of the wide variation  
in climate  and conditions  across  the U.S. There  is one common  feature  - total 
confinement.  Over  90% of the dairy  cows  are never  managed  outdoors  unless  
they are in the warmer  states  where  they are confined  in roofless  corrals  and 
are never  released  to forage  for themselves.  This system  has been developed  
as a result of years of subsidised  agriculture.  Buildings  and machinery  in
70
particular  were cheap  and the typical  farm has a graveyard  of over 50 years  
machinery.  In the traditional  dairy  states  of MinnesotaAVinsconsin  and east of 
there  it is common  to see sheds  which  were once  dairy  farms  now abandoned.
Over the past ten years milk price has averaged  about 17.6 p per 1 but it 
has fluctuated  from the Government  guaranteed  price of about 14.5 p per 1 to 
just over  22.0 p per 1 in that period.  The record  high  of 22.4  p per 1 was reached  
in September  1996 but within  3 months  it had dropped  to below 16.5 p per 
1 equivalent.  This volatility  is caused  by supply/demand  variation  in what is 
basically  a “home ” market  - only 2 to 3% of total production  is exported.
Data  from  the U.S. Department  of Agriculture  show  that the cost  of producing  
milk  on the average  U.S.  dairy  farm in 1994  was 24.2 p per 1. The average  price  
paid for milk in the U.S. in 1996  was 17.6 p per 1. Farmers  are basically  living  
off depreciation  in this scenario.  Production  in traditional  eastern  States is 
dropping  and there is a move to bigger  units in the mid-west  and west. In 
Wisconsin  there  were 120,000 dairy  farms  in 1950;  there  are 26,000  today  and 
it is reckoned  that in 7-8 years at least half of these will be out of business.  
T. Graff  and Ed Jesse,  University  of Madison,  report  that the only solution  is 
a move to larger  units with economies  of scale. From what I saw, however,  
this is not always  the case.  The number  of cows  per labour  unit on some  large  
units is only 50 to 60. The very efficient  ones are achieving  100 but these  are 
few and far between.  Many  of the large farms  are dependent  on cheap  Mexican  
labour  to make a margin.
Costs  of feed production  and manure  handling  are increasing  more  rapidly  
than the price of milk, placing  an economic  squeeze  on farmers.  In addition,  
the capital  investment  that is perceived  to be necessary  is making  confinement  
dairying  uneconomic.  The problem  with confinement  dairying  is that there is 
a whole  infrastructure  built up around  it. Everybody  involved  in that 
infrastructure  makes  money  except  the dairy farmer  - feed  companies,  machinery  
companies,  veterinary  salesmen,  semen  salesmen  and other  support  services.  
There  is a distinct  lack of independent  support  for the farmer  to help him avoid  
the maze of propaganda  that is fired at him every day.
Across  the U.S. any farmer  with  a grazing  system  was hungry  for information  
and was delighted  to have a caller  who was not trying  to sell him something.  
I began  to appreciate  Moorepark  and the advisory  structure  in Ireland  a lot 
better  after this experience.
There  is a very slow move  towards  grazing  in the U.S., less than 10% of 
dairy farmers,  but it is seen by many as a last resort  before  bankruptcy.  It is 
for many  because  they do not unload  themselves  of the capital  burden  that was  
breaking  them in the first place.
Another  surprising  feature  is the lack of contract  operators  and the insistence  
of every  farmer  in having  his own machinery.  This includes  harvesting  maize  
and alfalfa  hay and all the other  work  involved  in confinement  dairying.  Hence,  
there is a massive  investment  in machinery  even on small  40 to 50 cow farms  
which  increases  milk costs.
Research  at Cornell  University  on grazing  showed  that the north-east  U.S. 
can grow  as much  grass  dry matter  in a season  as in Ireland.  It is slightly  later
71
starting  in the spring  but they  can grow more  in the autumn.  The main  difference  
is the cold  winter  during  which  ryegrass  will not survive.  Brome  grass is popular  
but is harder  to manage  and has lower  quality  than ryegrass.  Cocksfoot  is also 
quite  common.  The red clover  is excellent  and tends  to be dominant.  The same  
applies  in Wisconsin.  In northern  Wisconsin ryegrass  can be grown  successfully  
due to the climatic  effect  of the Great  Lakes.
The eastern  region  of Texas  to the Atlantic  coast  is a milk deficit  area and 
is therefore  the highest  milk price area - 2.2 p per 1 higher  than other areas.  
But costs are higher  here too. Heat stress  is common  as summer  temperatures  
are often above  100 degrees  F. Confinement  sheds  are fitted  with fans to cool 
down cows.  This is also a hurricane  area and electric  storms  are possible  at 
any time without  warning.
Idaho  is a fine example  of an expanding  dairy industry  which  has grown  
from $73 m in 1970  to $500  m in 1995 - a growth  rate of 23% per year. Idaho  
dairy farmers  produced  636 m litres of milk in 1970. In 1995 they produced  
1,873  m litres  from 1,162  farms  with an average  of almost  200 cows  per farm  
- an increase  of 194% in production.  Average  milk yield per cow increased  
from  4,4501  in 1970  to 8,1831  in 1995.  There  are about  15,000  people  employed  
in the production,  processing,  transport  and distribution  of milk.  Avonmore  has 
been part of this growth  in Idaho  since 1989 and now has three impressive  
processing  sites there.  The majority  of the growth  has come  from large units  
of more  than 1,000  cows  - with a typical  investment  being  over  $4,000  per cow. 
Corrals  are open because  of the low rainfall  and there is no need for cover  
except  to provide  shade.  These  large units tend to buy feed from small local  
farms.  Most  crops  are irrigated.  The best grazing  management  which  I saw in 
the U.S. was being  practised  by a New Zealander  in Idaho.  He was managing  
800 cows on a farm with very low capital  investment,  that is, stock, land,  
irrigation  and milk shed.
In the western  states  of Washington  and Oregon,  there is potential  to graze  
in a reasonably  temperate  climate  but the price  of land here means  that people  
are selling  and moving  to cheaper  areas. Grazing  is more common  but 
nevertheless  frowned  upon and poorly  managed.
Assessment
I was surprised  at the potential  to grow  grass in many  parts  of the U.S. and 
at the lack of knowledge  of good  grazing  technology.  The latter  probably  stems  
from  two generations  that have been  driven  by subsidised  agriculture  into high  
output  artificial  production  systems.  There  is a lack of independent  measurement  
and advice  available  to the farmer  who is very much  dependent  on commercial  
salesmen.  The advantages  of independent  research  and advice  were  immediately  
obvious.
The U.S. has a large home  market  for dairy produce  and exports  only 2% 
to 3% of its production.  The population  is growing  at the rate of 4 m per year 
and consumption  of dairy  products  is growing  also. Prices  are likely  to be more  
stable  in the U.S. without  supports  than in an Ireland  without  supports  because  
of the lack of dependence  on exports.  Fluctuation  in cereal  prices  caused  by
72
extremes  of weather  or over-production  would  seem  to be the main  factor  that 
will influence  production  of milk in the U.S. for the foreseeable  future.
AUSTRALIA
Victoria  has the greatest  potential  for expansion  in Australia.  The picture  
was very different  from the U.S., namely,  an industry  that was focused  and 
growing.  Australia  produces  8.2 billion  litres  of milk  per annum,  62% of which  
is produced  in Victoria.  Twenty-five  per cent of total Australian  milk is used  
for liquid  milk  consumption  with  home  consumption  of manufactured  products  
accounting  for a further  30% of production,  leaving  45% of total production  
for export.  But this is growing  (about  15% growth  in 1996)  and 56% of exports  
are to Asia and a further  18% to Japan.
Victoria  accounts  for 90% of total Australian  dairy exports;  production  in 
the other states is practically  all home consumed.  In each state there are 
regulations  governing  liquid  milk production  with the purchase  price on the 
farm;  the farmer  is guaranteed  almost  twice  the manufacturing  price for liquid  
milk. In 1996, the liquid  price was 25.3 p per 1. The manufacturing  price was 
13.6 p per 1.
Marketing  of manufactured  dairy products  is also covered  by an industry  
funded  market  support  scheme;  industry  funds are used to subsidise  exports.  
A levy is imposed  on all milk production,  including  liquid  milk (1 p per 1). 
This generates  a fund of about  £75 m which  is used to subsidise  less than half 
of the production  that is exported.  This will be reduced  because  of GATT  and 
cannot  be more than 10% of the export  price in 2000.
In the years 1990 to 1995 the number  of dairy  farmers  in Victoria  reduced  
by 5% while at the same time herd size increased  by 25%, milk production  
increased  by 35%,  milk yield  per cow increased  by 17% and concentrates  fed 
per cow increased  by 100%.  There  are now 8,236  dairy farms  in Victoria  with  
an average  of 142 cows  per farm  feeding  524  kg of grain  per cow and producing  
4,479 1 of milk per cow.
The main research  centre  is at Ellinbank,  east of Melbourne  in an area well 
suited  for grass growth.  Rainfall  is 1100mm;  average  summer  and winter  
temperatures  are 20° and 8° respectively;  the area is prone  to drought  in January.  
The centre  has 217 ha of land; there are 450 cows - 50 autumn  calving  and 
400 spring  calving.  The centre  has 15 research  staff, 19 technicians  and 13 farm  
stalf.
The role of Ellinbank  is to undertake  research,  development  and extension  
relevant  to south-east  Australia  and the main components  of the research  
programme  are: Fertility,  Environmental  impact  of fertilisers.  Animal  nutrition  
and pasture  utilisation.  Milk  harvesting  (machinery).  Milk  and product  quality.
The budget  in 1996 was IR£1.5  m funded  by the Dairy Research  and 
Development  Corporation  (DRDC)  which  also funds other research  centres,  
universities  and private  companies.  The DRDC  collects  its funds  from  a farmer  
levy of 2.3 c per kg butterfat  (0.2 p per gallon).  This money  is matched  £ for 
£ by the Federal  Government.  Their  levy was increased  to 2.9 c per kg butterfat  
in 1997 and raised  about IR£11.5  m for both research  and extension  work.
73
The most striking  feature  of Ellinbank  was the close relationship  between  
Research  & Extension.  The main extension  drive is through  Target  10 and it 
is also based  at Ellinbank.  Both  research  and extension  have  similar  objectives,  
one of which  is to increase  the amount  of pasture  consumed  per hectare.  The 
present  average  in Victoria  is 61 per ha, some  farms  are achieving  151 at present  
- the objective  is to increase  that figure  to 20 t DM consumed  per ha. One of 
the principal  methods  of getting  the message  across  to farmers  is by using  A.B.C.  
Farms  - 3 small  farms  near the research  station  where  regular  farm walks  are 
held.
Assessment
Victorian  dairy  farming  is an industry  geared  up to expand.  Close  integration  
of research,  extension  and education and a clear  focus  on production  from  pasture  
is sure to pay dividends  from Victoria ’s cheapest  resource.  There  is also the 
advantage  of a reasonable  home  market  (55% of production)  where  consumption  
is growing,  and access  to the Asian  market  which  is being  developed  as fast 
as possible.  The Australian  Dairy  Council,  which  promotes  dairy  products  but 
does not sell them,  is operating  in several  countries  in Asia.  The levy on milk,  
including  liquid  milk, is using  the Australian  consumer  to subsidise  exports.  
The fact that the Government  sets the liquid  price  is a price  support  which  does  
not cost the Government  money. A  very large  levy in Ireland  would  be required  
in order  to have the same effect.
CHILE
Total milk production  in Chile  is about  a quarter  that of Ireland  at 1.7 m 
tonnes.  Up to 20% of this production  is in chums  but from 1998 churns  will 
not be allowed.  The Government  has set up an advisory  service  to help small  
farmers  (less than 80 ha); 60% of farms are less than this and they produce  
30% of the milk. Some  of the advisers  are trying  to set up co-ops  with storage  
centres  for cooling  milk for these small producers.
There  are 17 milk purchasers  in Chile  but they are not all processing.  About  
70% of the industry  is controlled  by Nestle  (Swiss),  Soprole  (50% owned  by 
N.Z. Dairy Board)  and Paramalat  (Italian).  These  companies  are using their  
position  in Chile  to bring in products  from abroad.  In 1995 Brazil  increased  
its tax on Chilean  milk imports  from 10% to 16% because  they believe  that 
cheap  N.Z. product  is coming  to Brazil  via Chile.  Chile  started  exporting  dairy  
products  only five years ago; exports  were worth  $25 m in 1995 and $35 m 
in 1996.
Farmers  are being  forced  into all year round  production  because  processors  
are trying  to flatten  the production  curve  in order  to utilise  capacity.  Farmers  
who produce  milk all year round  receive  18.7 p per 1 and smaller  farmers  who 
produce  seasonal  milk  receive  only 10 to 11 p perl.  The latter  are under  pressure  
from processors.  Production  is growing  at up to 20% per year and there will 
be a need for major  investment  in processing  capacity  to maintain  this growth.  
The only subsidy  available  is a free advisory  service  to small farmers  (under  
80 ha). These  farmers  have 80 to 100 cows and very poor facilities.  Mobile  
milking  parlours  are common.
74
Nestle  exercises  a high degree  of control  in this country.  At least 25% of 
the products  on the shelves  were  Nestle:  milk,  butter, yoghurts,  flavoured  milks  
in large  supplies,  condensed  milk,  powdered  milk,  baby  foods,  breakfast  cereals,  
biscuits,  chocolate,  cream,  coffee  and many more.
Assessment
While  there are some  excellent  grass farmers  in Chile  the majority  of milk  
is produced  in confinement  operations  or a mixture  of both.  There  is much  U.S. 
influence  particularly  in liquid milk producing  areas near the centres  of 
population.  Keenans  have  penetrated  the market  here for diet feeders  very well.  
Average  farm  size is quite  large. The farm  owner  often  lives  in a city and comes  
to the farm 1-2 days a week.  Because  of this, the farm is dependent  on poorly  
educated  workers.  The industry  will grow steadily  but potential  is limited  by 
lack of good  research,  extension  and education.  Little  product  is exported  and 
with a population  of 15 m people  and consumption  growing,  Chile will be 
cushioned  from the instability  of the world  market.
ARGENTINA
Milk  production  in Argentina  has grown  at about 10% per year since 1989  
and is now  estimated  to be 9 m tonnes  per year  - almost  twice  the Irish  production.  
Of this, 25% is in liquid  milk consumption  and 45% is cheese.  Only 8% of 
production  is exported  but this is growing  rapidly.  Brazil  is a huge market  of 
130 m people  and as its economy  grows,  food consumption  is increasing.  
Argentina,  Brazil,  Paraquay  and Uruguay  have a common  trading  block  called  
Mericosur  which  gives  Argentina  and Uruguay  as dairy  exporters  priority  access  
to the Brazilian  market.  Chile  is being  encouraged  into the group  for access  
to the Pacific  and exports  to Asia.
The main dairy producing  area is in the province  of Santa Fe where  the 
number  of dairy  farmers  has dropped  in the last 20 years  from 15,262  to 5,664.  
In the same  period, cow numbers  dropped  by only 5%,  while  production  doubled  
and productivity  per hectare  increased  from a very low 30 kg butterfat  per ha 
to 133 kg per ha. Number  of cows  per farm increased  from 40 to 95; average  
size of dairy farms increased  from 85 ha to 100 ha from 1975 to 1996.
The main dairy research  centre  is in Rafaela  and is leading  the drive for 
increased  production.  Results  show that production  can be doubled.  Traditional  
farms  are averaging  3,000  to 4,0001  per cow per lactation  while  better  farmers  
are achieving  5,500  to 6,000 1 per cow. In Rafaela  Research  Centre  they are 
achieving  7,500  to 8,000 1 per lactation.  The average  stocking  rate on more  
traditional  farms  is less than 1 cow per ha while at the research  centre  it is 
between  2.0 and 2.5 cows per ha.
The main forage  consists  of alfalfa  pasture,  brome  grass/cocksfoot/clover  
pasture,  some annual  ryegrass,  alfalfa  hay, maize  silage  and concentrate.  
Perennial  ryegrass  cannot  be grown  because  of the heat - over 30 degrees  in 
the summer.  Management  of pasture  is difficult  due to types  of grasses  but the 
alfalfa  hay and maize  silage  are consistently  high in quality.  Pasture  must be 
reseeded  every  4 to 5 years.  Concentrates  are cheap,  £100 to £120  per tonne.
75
Farms  are well fenced  and are equipped  with windmills  bringing  up water  
from  the high  water  table.  No buildings  of any significance  are to be seen,  pointing  
to low investment  as a major  advantage.  Milking  parlours  are only now becoming  
common.  Animals  are managed  outdoors  all year round  and hay, silage,  etc. is 
fed under  electric  wires on top of the ground.  If the ground  becomes  mucked  
up, cows are moved  to a new site. Concentrates  are fed in parlours  all year 
round  and as calving  is all-year-round  it is difficult  to estimate  the amount  fed. 
It is generally  ad-lib  while milking  and is estimated  to be over 2 tonnes  per 
cow per year on most farms.
Thirty  five per cent of the milk is processed  by co-operatives  and 65% by 
private  companies.  The largest  processor  is a co-operative  called  Sancor  with  
about  20% of the total.  The top 5 processors  account  for 75% of the total.  There  
are many  small  processors  and purchasers  who  Just  sell on the milk  for processing.  
The supply  curve  is fairly  flat with the spring  only 25% higher  than the lowest  
point.
The vast plains  of arable  land in Argentina  and the farm structure  make  it 
one of the best regions  in the world  for farming.  It is possible  to produce  milk  
here all year round  at low cost. If production  were seasonal  it would  be even  
lower  cost but because  of the lack of farmer  control  of the industry  at processing  
level, farmers  are forced  into all-year  production.
Conclusions
1. Research
Moorepark  Research  Centre  is one of the best dairy  research  facilities  in the 
world  and is the best centre  for grass utilisation.  This gives the Irish industry  
an advantage  that must be continued.
2. Research-Extension  link
A greater  link between  research  and extension  is needed  in Ireland. In Australia  
and New Zealand  and also Argentina  where  the industry  is growing,  the link 
between  research  and extension  is very strong.  A sizeable  proportion  of the 
producer  levies  is spent  on extension.  In Ireland  all the levy  is spent  on research  
and the link between  research  and extension  is poor. I believe  that researchers  
should  keep in contact  regularly  with a number  of farms in order to keep in 
touch  with  problems.  Likewise  the advisors  should  have  a greater  role in research.
3. Grass varieties
There  is need  for a major  international  research  programme  between  Ireland,  
the U.K.,  Australia  and New Zealand  to develop  more  productive  varieties  of 
ryegrass.  In north  America  the development  of maize  is proceeding  so fast that 
it is moving  north at the rate of 10 km per year. Developments  in crops like 
barley  and wheat  are to be seen in Ireland;  7.5 1 of spring  barley  per ha is common  
and 12.5 t of wheat  per ha is being achieved.  Genetic  progress  in maize  is 
increasing  yields  by about  4% per annum  and by 1.5 to 2.0% in wheat  and 
barley.  The seed companies  are investing  massive  amounts  of money  into 
researching  new varieties.  Because  grass  is not sown  every  year,  seed  companies  
are not inclined  to put as much into researching  new varieties.

4. Capital  investment
Teagasc should  demonstrate  systems  of dairy farming  which  have  low capital  
investment.  We should  make  better  use of shelter  belts instead  of concrete  and 
it would  be more environmentally  friendly.  One obvious  feature  on my tour 
was that a large  capital  investment  tended  to be the millstone  around  the farmer ’s 
neck.  In contrast,  anywhere  the industry  was expanding,  e.g. the western  USA  
with large outdoor  corrals  or in the southern  hemisphere  on pasture  based  
systems,  the capital  investment  was low.
In Ireland,  farmers  with small  quotas  spend  large  sums  of money  on slatted  
tanks  and elaborate  facilities  which  leaves  them  in debt even after  grants.  The 
industry  cannot  support  the type  of capital  investment  that has become  the norm  
especially  in a world  of freer trade.
5. Fertility
More  research  is required  into fertility and  embryonic  death  in high  producing  
animals  in order  to maintain  a 365-day  interval.  This is essential  for seasonal  
grass based production.
6. Processing  industry
One of the great advantages  that Ireland  enjoys  is farmer  control  of its 
processing  industry.  It is important  that farmers  retain  this control.  In Chile,  
Argentina  and the U.S. private  industry  has forced  farmers  into all-year-round  
production  at farm level in order  to provide  them with a level supply  of raw 
material.  This reduces  processing  costs but the savings  are not passed  on to 
the farmer.  The board  members  of our co-ops  have large responsibilities  to 
ensure  a well run business  while  at the same time ensuring  maximum  return  
to the farmer  share-holder.  Share-holders  should  take note of this when  electing  
board  members.  This is particularly  true of co-op  controlled  pic’s. In Western  
Australia  a former  dairy co-op that went fully pic and expanded  into other  
businesses  such  as oil and fertilisers,  eventually  sold  off  its dairy  business  because  
it was not profitable  enough.  This company  lost sight of its roots. Who is to 
say that this could  not happen  in Ireland?  Can the level of growth  expected  
by the stock  exchange  investor  be sustained  long-term?
1. Growing  markets
Our  politicians  must  ensure  fair access  to growing  markets  in the next  world  
trade negotiations.  Europe  must argue strongly  for greater  access  to South  
American  and Asian  markets  because  the US and Cairns  Group  are trying  to 
exclude  us from  thriving  economies  and fence  us into a European  market  which  
is losing  its importance.
8. Liquid  consumption
There  will always  be milk  production  near  centres  of population  and demand  
will ensure  that there  is a constant  supply  of milk for liquid  consumption.  The 
farm price for this milk can be up to twice  the price for manufacturing  milk  
e.g. Australia.  In some  countries  this accounts  for 100%  of production  at various  
times  of the year. Also near centres  of population,  there are often  by-products  
of other food industries  which  provide  feed for dairy cows at low cost.
77
9. World  market
Only 6% of total world  production  is traded  across  international  borders.  
Of the countries  that are trading  on that market  only two are dependent  on 
exporting  over 80% of their production:  Ireland  80%; New Zealand  80%;  
Denmark  50%;  Holland  40%;  Australia  45%;  Argentina  8%; U.S. 2-3%.  These  
figures  are important  because  of the stability  a large home market  gives to 
producer  prices  particularly  if a large  percentage  of production  is in liquid  milk.  
Because  of this factor,  Irish and New Zealand  prices  are the most likely to 
fluctuate  if there  was an open  market.  Ireland  has more  access  to the European  
market  which  should  give some  cushion  but we have seen in the past that this 
might  be of little use when  the pressure  intensifies,  as was the case in the BSE  
disaster.  To move  into fresh products,  there must be a large home  market  to 
fall back  on when  surpluses  arise.  There  may be niches  for some  fresh  products  
but they will only require  a small  volume  of milk and this can be supplied  on 
contract  as Baileys  is at present.
10. Infrastructure
All countries  have a higher  herd size than Ireland  and a lower  number  of 
herds  relative  to their  milk  production:  U.S. 80 cows,  Victoria  142 cows.  New  
Zealand  200 cows, Chile  80 cows,  Argentina  95 cows,  Denmark  50 cows,  Ireland  
32 cows. When  we joined  the EEC in 1973, Ireland  and Denmark  both had 
about  74,000  dairy  farmers.  Denmark  has a milk  quota  the same  size as Ireland.  
It presently  has 12,000  dairy farmers  with an average  of 50 cows each. The 
Danes  are restructuring  their industry  in order to be ready when quotas  go. 
They  have  already  decided  that they require  5,000  farmers  with 100 cows  each  
by 2005.
Milk quota  management  policy  in Ireland  has clearly  been much less 
aggressive  and has sought  to give smaller  producers  a chance.  Now that the 
Santer  proposals  are on the table,  it is likely  though  not certain  that the quota  
regime  will be retained  until 2006.  It is, however,  clear  that sooner  or later it 
will be abolished  and dairy  farmers  will have  to contend  with  world  milk  prices.  
It is vital that we use the transition  period  to prepare  for a more  competitive  
production  environment.  We will have fewer  dairy farmers  in years  to come.
Commins  and Frawley  (1995)  predicted  that there will be 79,000  farmers  
in Ireland'in  2005.  If present  trends  continue,  only 16,000  of these  will be dairy  
farmers  with an average  of about 50 cows each.
Efficient  small  dairy  farmers  must  be given  an opportunity  to increase  their  
scale.  It is my view  that, in a world  price  environment,  a specialist  dairy  farmer  
will need at least 60-80  cows to earn the same margin  as he does now with  
30 cows  within  the present  milk  quota  regime.  Less  efficient  small  dairy  farmers  
must be given  opportunities  to boost  their farm income  with alternative  farm  
enterprises  and/or  off-farm  employment.

Milk Quota  Policies
M. DOWLING
Former  Secretary,  Department  of Agriculture  and Food, Dublin.
Why quotas?
Throughout  the late 1970s  and early 1980s  the Community  grappled  with  
the budgetary  and market  problems  created  by rising  milk  production.  Prudent  
or frozen  prices,  producer  levies  and non marketing  schemes  had failed  to deal 
with the problem.  The result  was that the Community ’s self sufficiency  ratio  
in milk which  was only marginally  over 100% when we joined  in 1973 was 
about  123%  ten years  later.  Despite  an active  export  policy,  increasing  production  
was by that time pushing  butter  intervention  stocks  towards  1.5 m tonnes  and 
skim powder  stocks  towards  1 m tonnes.  Even with massive  subsidisation  - 
FEOGA  expenditure  in the milk  sector  rose from 1.6 to 4.4 b ECU  in the 1973-  
83 period  - there were no sustainable  market  outlets  for such stocks.  Indeed  
the Community  was eventually  forced  to subsidise  both butter  fat and skim  
powder  in the manufacture  of calf milk replacer  - such an inherently  illogical  
subsidy  might  be accepted  as a short  term emergency  measure,  it could  not be 
justified  as part of any longer  term stock disposal  programme.
In those  circumstances  the Community  was  forced  to take action.  There  were  
only two choices:
— a very sharp price reduction,  or
— tight supply  control.
The prevailing  wisdom  was that the price  cut would  need  to be of up to 25%  
to offer  a reasonable  prospect  of solving  the problem  and, even then,  could  not 
be guaranteed  to do so in the short to medium  term at least. Member  States,  
led by Germany  in particular,  recoiled  from the price  cut prospect  and in 1984  
opted for quotas,  warts and all.
And there  were  warts  - production  rigidities,  disincentives  to innovation  and 
development,  loss of export  markets  and vast  bureaucracy. But, within  the limited  
objectives  set for them,  quotas  - admittedly  having  been subsequently  adjusted  
by 8.5%  because  of setting  them  too high  in the first  place  - have  been  successful.  
Expenditure  in the milk  sector  which  was about  35% of total  FEOGA  Guarantee  
expenditure  on the introduction  of quotas,  is now less than 10% of total  
expenditure. EU self  sufficiency  is well  under  110%  and  milk  prices  for producers  
have  remained  relatively  high.  Irish  prices  in real terms have  on average  remained  
at their 1983 levels.
Current  position
Quotas  were initially  set generally  at 1981 output  levels  plus 1%. For most  
Member  States  that represented  sharp cuts in production  compared  to 1983 
levels.  There  were some exceptions,  most notably  Ireland,  which  was given  
a quota  equal  to 1983  plus  4.6%  - about  23%  above  1981 delivery  levels.  Quotas  
have been adjusted  on a number  of occasions  since 1984 - on balance  
substantially  downwards  but with some upward  movement  also which  was
79
generally  small but, in Ireland ’s case, reasonably  substantial  as a result  of the 
Mulder  adjustments.  The current  Irish quota  is almost  3.5% below  the quota  
level  set in 1984  but about  1 % above  1993  delivery  levels.  By contrast  the current  
quotas  in the other  main milk producing  member  States  are between  10% and 
15% below 1983 delivery  levels.
That is where  we now are. The questions  are where  do we wish to go and 
where  are we likely  to go. The answer  to the latter  question  is influenced  by 
economic  factors  but even  more  so by political  considerations  - national,  European  
and international,  in the guise  of the WTO.  The considerations  influencing  the 
answer  to the former  are no less political  but of a more national  flavour.  The 
current  position  is that the quota  regime  is in place  up to the end of 1999.  Without  
a decision  in the Council  to continue  it, it lapses  at that time. A decision  to 
extend  the regime  requires  a Commission  proposal  and a qualified  majority  in 
the Council  - 62 votes  out of 87. As of now, there  are at least  5 member  States,  
representing  35 votes,  who  do not favour  continuation  of the system in its present  
form.  Thus,  extension  of the regime  requires  a proposal  for a regime  sufficiently  
changed  to be acceptable  to at least  some  of those  member  States  or one which  
is part of a package  which  is, in overall  terms,  acceptable  to them.  That, to a 
considerable  extent,  explains  both why the new quota  proposal  is placed  within  
the Agenda  2000 package  and the nature  of the proposal  itself.
Agenda  2000
Agenda  2000, in its milk section,  proposes:
• a 15% cut in support  prices;
• premium  payments  in part compensation,  and
• maintenance  of the quota  regime  to 2006, with a 2% increase  in quotas  - 
1 % for all member  States  for distribution  with priority  to young  farmers  
and 1 % for distribution  to farmers  in mountain  regions.
The method  of distribution  proposed  would  result  in increased  quota  allocations  
of:
1 % for Belgium,  Denmark,  Ireland,  Luxembourg,  the Netherlands  and the UK; 
1.3% for Germany;
2.3% for France  and Sweden;
2.9% for Greece  and Portugal;
3% for Italy;
4% for Spain;  7.8% for Austria,  and 
8.4% for Finland.
In addition  Austria  and Finland  would  have further  increases  in quota  of 7.8%  
and 8.4% made available  to them to meet claims  from SLOM  producers.
Introducing  some flexibility  to the regime,  especially  to meet the needs  of 
new entrants  and certain  regions,  is necessary  in itself  and, in particular,  to sway  
some  of the member  States  at present  opposed  to the extension  of the regime.  
Therefore,  it was  inevitable  that there  would  be a proposal  which  involved  some  
additional  quota  and a method  of distribution  of the extra  quota  based  on objective  
criteria  which  would  have  the incidental  effect  of skewing  the allocation  towards  
sensitive  member  States.  Inevitably  also, there would  be a cautious  approach
80
to deciding  on the amount  of the extra quota  to be proposed  in order not to 
risk destabilising  the market.
Even  seen in that context,  however,  the present  proposal  is seriously  flawed  
because;
- it is overcautious  in regard  to the amount  of extra  quota  to be provided;
- the disparity  between  the treatment  of the individual  member  States  is 
grossly  excessive;
- two of the member  States  whose  views  on the extension  of the system  
may need to be changed  are in the lowest  increase  category;
- a number  of member  States  whose  support  would  normally  be expected  
will feel themselves  hard done by;
- the Mediterranean  bloc may still not be satisfied  with the additional  
quantities  proposed,  and
- the economic  rationale  of the proposal  is, to say the least, questionable.  
It is impossible  to see the proposal  adopted  as it stands.  But neither  is it likely  
that what has been offered  can be significantly  withdrawn.  Therefore,  almost  
certainly  the solution  will be an increase  in the overall  additional  quota  in order  
to provide  for a certain  degree  of equality  of distribution  among  member  States  
who would  then be given greater  flexibility  in the subsequent  national  
distribution.
There  is, however,  a limit  on the extra  quota  which  may be made  available  
and it is not just the limit of what  the market  will bear. There  is a clear  WTO  
constraint  also.  The Uruquay  Round  agreement  required  the EU to reduce  overall  
support  levels  by 20% compared  to the 1986-88  base. But it also required  that 
support  levels  in any individual  sector  could  not exceed  the levels  which  applied  
in 1992.  Thus,  an increase  in quota  levels,  offset  in terms  of measuring  support  
by a cut in price, would  not break that provision.  Indeed,  roughly  speaking,  
each 1 % price cut would  allow a 2% increase  in quota.  Complication  arises,  
however,  where  the price cut is, as is now proposed,  being at least partially  
offset  by direct  payments. Such  payment  must  be taken  into account  in calculating  
support  levels  for this provision.  The current  Commission  proposal  would  not, 
in my view, bring support  levels  above  the 1992 levels.  Indeed,  there would  
be scope  for a further  4% or so quota  increase  and still remain  within  the 1992  
support  levels,  if the other  elements  of the Commission  proposal  remained  in 
place. But any significant  improvement  in the compensation  element  of the 
proposal  would  eliminate  the possibility  of further  - or, depending  on the extent  
of the improvement,  any - quota  increase.  There  is also, of course,  the question  
of how much  extra production  the market  could  easily  absorb.  Recent  work  
done here would  suggest  that, with a reduction  of 15% in EU price levels,  a 
gradual  4% increase  in quota  would  not destabilise  the market.  In my view  this 
would,  as already  explained,  be comfortably  compatible  with the WTO  
commitment.
Next WTO  Round
This  is on the reasonable  assumption  that the provision,  or a somewhat  similar  
updated  one, will be carried  into the next Round.  Indeed  consideration  of this
81
issue  in that context  underlines  one every  important  fact - developments  in the 
WTO  will have a major  impact  on the practicality  if the EU maintaining  the 
quota  regime  into the longer  term.
We will begin negotiating  a new Round  next year. There  are two general  
points  about that negotiation  which  are worth  noting:
• It will not take the same protracted  length  of time as did the last one. 
Issues  of principle  were settled  in the Uruquay  Round,  as were  
implementation  mechanisms  such as the support  measurement  system  
and the tariffication  procedure.  They will not have to be settled  again.
• It will maintain  the liberalisation  of the last Round.
That means  that we could see the outcome  of the WTO  agreement  being  
applied  as from  the end of the current  period  and that the tariff  reduction  process  
would  continue  at, at least, the same pace in the 2001-2006  period  as it did 
in the 1995-2001  years.
The new buying  in prices  which  would  emerge  from the Santer  proposals  are 
equivalent  to about 117p per gallon  gross.  If - and this is the least we could  
expect  - tariff  reduction  in the new WTO  round  takes place at the same rate 
(6% a year)  as generally  applied  in the Uruquay  Round,  then, in  milk  equivalent  
terms,  the tariff  at the end of the round  would  be about  42p per gallon  gross.  
Assuming  that world  prices  do not fall, that would  leave the landed  price of 
milk products  in Europe  up to 20% above  the buying  in prices.  Thus  EU milk  
prices  would  still be adequately  protected  and so, seen in that context,  the 
continuation  of quotas  can be justified.
Some factors  could,  however,  emerge  which  would  upset that relatively  
benign  scenario.  Firstly,  tariff  reductions  might  be greater  (e.g. based  on the 
original,  rather  than the bound  rates) although  this is, in my view, unlikely.  
Secondly,  world  prices  might  fall as the EU and others increase  milk  production.  
On balance,  however,  it would  seem  that there  is likely  to be a sufficient  margin  
to give adequate  protection  even if international  prices  fall.
The process  of tariff  reduction  is likely,  however,  to be relentless  and to 
continue  beyond  the next Round.  If so, before  the end of the decade,  the tariff  
would  not be sufficient  to protect  the EU price (indeed,  if EU prices  were not 
to be reduced  by the Santer  15%, that situation  would  arise by the end of the 
next Round).  That would  happen  first in regard  to butter  but would  eventually  
apply  to the other  dairy  products  as well. At that stage  the case for maintaining  
quotas  would  not be sustainable.
Effect  of enlargement
The enlargement  process  will reinforce  the economic  pressure  for quota  
dismantlement.  Nobody  will want  to see quotas  introduced  in the new member  
States.  The administrative  complexity  of introducing,  and enforcing,  quotas  in 
those countries  is daunting.  Even the basis on which  to establish  quotas  in 
agricultural  economies  in transition  from centrally  planned  regimes  would  be 
very difficult  to decide  on. But if nobody  wants  to introduce  quotas  then,  neither  
will anyone  in the existing  Union  wish  to see quotas  retained  here while  farmers  
are free to produce  without  restriction  in the new areas.
82
What  the future  holds
These  factors,  together  with the strong  anti-quota  attitude  of a big minority  
of existing  member  States,  makes  the demise  of the regime  inevitable.  And  they 
may,  in fact,  cause  quotas  to be ended  a little  earlier  than is economically  strictly  
necessary.  So, if - as I think  is almost  certain  - quotas  are to be extended  for 
the six years  up to April  2006,  this is highly likely  to be the last such  unconditional  
extension.  If I am right, then two questions  arise:
- how will quotas  be ended,  and
- will farmers  be compensated?
The first question  involves  consideration  of whether  quotas  will be eliminated  
in one step or in phases.  If the Council  were to decide  in the Santer  package  
that quotas  will definitely  end in 2006,  then phasing  would  not arise.  I believe  
that that is unlikely  and that the issue  will probably  be fudged  in the agreement  
on the Santer  package.  In that event,  the most  likely  scenario  is a decision  closer  
to 2006  to phase  out quotas  over  a period  of years  in combination  with further  
cuts in support  prices  and other changes  in the support  system.
Will there be compensation?  I would  think the answer  to that is yes. The 
question  is how will compensation  be paid - for the quotas  or in respect  of 
lower  milk  prices?  The former  would  be cheaper  in that only those  with  existing  
quotas  would  benefit  and thus, for instance,  there would  be no question  of 
producers  in the new member  States  having  to be taken  into account.  It would,  
however,  almost  certainly  be once off or at least time limited  and digressive.  
Compensation  for lower  milk prices  would  be likely  to be longer  lasting  but 
would  in time extend  to new entrants  to milk production  and to those in the 
new member  States.  It would,  however,  be in line with the premium  regime  
being  proposed  in the Santer  package  and with  recent  European  Court  judgements  
which  have seen quotas  more as a licence  to produce  than a capital  asset.  At 
this stage this is a difficult  one to call, but, on balance,  my money  would  be 
on a compensation  system  related  to lower  milk prices.
Conclusion  - What  does Ireland  need?
Finally,  what  do we want  in Ireland?  I suspect  that the m^ority  of existing  
dairy farmers  would  like to see the quota  system  maintained  more or less as 
it is. But, for the reasons  already  mentioned,  I do not believe  that that is an 
option  into the longer  term/  In any event,  as the WTO  constraints  tighten  - and 
limitations  on subsidised  exports  as well as the tariffication  process  will put 
increasing  pressure  on prices - it is very doubtful  that it is in our interests  
to try to maintain  quotas  indefinitely.  In the circumstances  likely to prevail,  
they could  be maintained,  if at all, only at the expense  of sharp  cuts in production.
At the same time a sudden  abandonment  of quotas  would  cause very  
substantial  disruption  in the sector  and real hardship  to very many  farmers.  It 
is, therefore,  in our interests  to see the quota  system  extended  for a period  but 
on terms  which  would  help to ease the way towards  its inevitable  elimination.  
This involves  decisions  to be taken as part of the Santer  package  and those  
which  might  follow  a few years thereafter.
83
In my view, our interests  might  best be secured  by a package  of measures  
along  the following  lines:
1) Extension  of the quota  system  for a further  5 to 6 years.
2) The maximum  increase  in quotas  which  is technically  possible  and 
consistent  with what the market  can bear.
3) Use of the additional  quota  over and above  what the Commission  has 
proposed  to redress  the imbalance  in its proposal.
4) Provision  of compensation  which  in general  is no greater  than that 
proposed  by the Commission  - to increase  that significantly  would  limit  
the possibilities  for increased  quota.
5) If there  is an Irish  case  for improved  compensation  - and the continuation  
of the maize  silage  aid may  provide  one - then  it would  be better  exercised  
in seeking  to improve  our envelope  and use the result  to deal with any 
anomalies  thrown  up by the way the general  dairy premium  is to be 
calculated.
6) Maintenance  of the proposed  15% price  cut - anything  lower  would  not 
allow  any significant  exports  without  refund  and these  are necessary  if 
market  balance  is to be maintained.
7) A decision  on the phasing  out of quotas  to be taken some  years  in advance  
of the start of that process.
8) Payment  of compensation  to all dairy farmers,  by way of a dairy cow 
premium  or an area  based  premium,  for the lower  milk  prices  rather  than 
compensation  just to those holding  milk quotas  at the time of their  
elimination.  This would  bring  greater  longer  term benefit  to the sector  
and encourage  a more rational  development  of production.
9) In the  WTO  agreement,  change  the balance  in the tariff  reduction  process  
in favour  of butter  and against  skim  powder,  as the butter  price  will come  
under  pressure  from the import  price much  sooner  than the skim price  
(the balance  was the other way in the Uruquay  Round  agreement).
I believe  that represents  the best way forward  for us. Obviously  not all will 
agree - particularly,  perhaps,  in regard  to compensation  and the price cut 
suggestions.  But staying  where  we are is not an option.  Therefore,  we need  
to be thinking  seriously  about  where  we want  to go. The quota  system  and the 
questions  of how it is to be continued,  modified  and eventually  phased  out are 
fundamental  to the milk sector  and we need some  fundamental  thinking  about  
the answers  to these  questions.  I have  put forward  these  ideas  to this conference  
as a small contribution  to the debate.  I will be interested  in the response.

Feeding  Strategies  Used by Specialised  
Winter  Beef Finishers:  Growth,  
Efficiency  and Cost of Gain

Introduction
Winter  finishing  is one of many  beef  production  systems  operated  in Ireland.  
In this system,  cattle are purchased  in the autumn,  grown  at a high target  rate 
during  the winter  months  before  slaughter  from January  onwards.  Profitability  
in this, as in any beef enterprise,  is influenced  by many factors  including  the 
buying  and selling  price,  daily liveweight  gain, input  costs and the availability  
of slaughter  premia.  In the Teagasc  winter  finishing  budget  shown  in Table 1, 
“excellent ” performance  (i.e. margin)  over production  costs is obtained  from a 
daily liveweight  gain of 1.1 kg with a feed (grass  silage  and concentrates)  cost 
of £1.15/day.  Since the sensitivity  analysis  (Table  2) shows  that animal  
performance  makes  a large  contribution  to the gross  margin  per hectare  realised  
by the producer  it is imperative  for profitability that performance  be at a maximum  
but at a minimum  ration  cost.
Based  on studies  at Grange  Research  Centre  where  concentrates  were  offered  
ad libitum,  the growth  potential  of finishing  continental  steers in a non­
compensatory  growth  situation  is 1.16 to 1.25 kg/day  (Moloney  and O’Kiely,  
1995;  French  et ai, 1997; Keane,  1995).  Similar  studies  at University  College  
Dublin  indicated  a growth  potential  of 1.03 kg/day  for steers (O’Mara  et al, 
1996).  However,  finishing  continental  cattle  which  were  likely  exhibiting  some  
compensatory  growth  potential  had growth  rates  of 1.42 kg/day  for steers  (French  
et al, 1997)  and 1.35 kg/day  for heifers  (Gottstein  et ai, 1997).  Growth  rates,  
similar  or greater  than these are often claimed  in practice.  Thus, exploiting  
compensatory  growth  and/or  using  alternate  feedstuffs  such  as sugar  beet,  fodder  
beet, home  grown  cereals  or by-products  may result  in higher  performance  at 
a lower  feed cost than indicated  in the Teagasc  budget  (Table  1). Since  animal  
growth  is the product  of intake  by the energy  density  of the diet, such  performance  
may reflect  intakes  in practice  that are higher  than usually  seen in a research  
environment  (18 g dry matter  (DM)/kg  body  weight, approximately).  The objective  
of the study summarised  in this paper  was to identify  some  strategies  used by 
specialised  winter  finishers  and to quantify  the performance,  intake  and feed 
costs on these farms.
Procedure
• Ten specialised  winter  finishing  units  were  chosen  according  to the following
criteria:

• On each farm, a group  of animals  was identified  for this study.  After the 
animals  had adapted  to the housing  facilities  and the diet (~ 3 weeks),  they 
were weighed  on two consecutive  mornings  before  feeding.  The animals  
were again  weighed  twice  (on all but 2 of the 10 farms)  at the end of the 
finishing  period.  The average  of each pair of weights  for each animal  was 
used in the calculation  of growth  rate.
• Slaughter  data were collected  (where  possible)  for each individual  animal.
• The accuracy  of the feeder  wagon  was tested  by unloading  it onto  a calibrated  
Teagasc  scales  and comparing  the readings  on the feeder  wagon  with the 
weight  of material  unloaded.
• Feed  intake  was measured  by recording  the amount  of each  ingredient  offered  
during  a 7 day period  (two measurement  periods  on some farms)  and 
subtracting  the weight  of feed not eaten during  the recording  period.
• Samples  were taken  of each individual  feed on 2 or more  occasions  during  
the period  of feed intake  measurement.  These  samples  were chemically  
analysed  at Grange  Research  Centre.
• Feeding  and husbandry  practices  were monitored  (feeding  methods  and 
routine,  feed space per animal,  parasite  control,  etc.).
Results
The experiment  was carried  out between  November  1997 and March  1998 
(when  final cattle were slaughtered).  The 10 farms chosen  (labelled  A to J) 
were in counties  Kildare  (3), Carlow  (4) and Laois  (3). General  procedures  on 
each farm are summarised  in Table  3. Each  farm used a feeder  wagon  (various  
suppliers).  The difference  between  the amount  of feed  discharged  from  the feeder  
wagon  and the reading  on the feeder  wagon  dial ranged  from 0.3 to 4.0%.

The variation  in ration  composition  on the 10 farms  is summarised  in Table  
4. Grass  silage  was used on all farms  but the level of inclusion  in the ration  
ranged  from  202 to 579 g/kg  DM. In addition,  the DM digestibility  of the silage,  
and therefore  its feeding  value,  was variable  (range  680 to 780 g/kg,  mean  740,  
coefficient  of variation  5.5%).  Eight  of the farms  used  fodder  beet  and one farm  
used sugar  beet.  A variety  of protein  and energy  sources  were  also used (Table
4). A price  was assigned  to the grass  silage,  based  on its DM digestibility,  using  
the cropcost  computer  program  (O’Kiely  et al., 1997).  Costs  were assigned  to 
the other  ingredients  based  on December  prices  on the Farmers  Journal.  Total  
feed costs ranged  from £0.86/kg  to £1.71/kg,  mean  £1.23/kg.

Measured  animal  performance  is summarised  in Table  5. There  was a wide  
range  in the weight  of cattle performance  on each farm, the growth  rate and 
feed  intake  achieved  and the cost  of animal  growth.  These  data  can be compared  
with  the Teagasc  budget  for a primarily grass  silage-based  winter  finishing  system  
described  in Table 1.
As outlined  in the introduction,  profitability  in an individual  beef  production  
system  is influenced  not only by technical  performance,  but also by buying/  
selling  prices,  negotiated  prices  of ingredients,  etc. To examine  the impact  of

Food and Forestry  -weekly  price reporting  - October  1997)
* carcass  value was £ 1.85/kg
* ration  costs were standardised  as described  above
Calculated  gross  margin/animal,  excluding  premia,  ranged  from  A to B (£) mean,  
coefficient  of variation.
Summary  and Conclusions
* Of the 10 farms  chosen  for this study,  all were specialised  winter  finishers  
located  in Leinster,  all used  feeder  wagons,  all used  grass  silage  as the basal  
forage  and most used beet (mainly  fodder  beet).  How representative  these  
systems  of production  are of the winter  feeding  sector  remains  to be 
determined.
* Diverse  strategies  were used on the 10 farms,  i.e. purchase  weight  of the 
cattle,  finishing  period,  ration  composition,  housing,  etc.
* Considerable  variation  in feed intake  and animal  growth  was observed  
between  farms.  Average  animal  performance  on individual  farms  was not 
better  than would  be typically  recorded  in a research  environment.
* There  is scope  on many of the farms  to improve  technical  performance.
* Profitability  on an individual  farm varied  considerably.

Introduction
The return  from  finishing  cattle  in Ireland  and in particular  winter  finishing,  
as a consequence  of the B.S.E.  crisis  and changes  in E.U. market  supports  has, 
as we all know,  reached  an all time low. This price  crash  occurred  in the other  
major  European  beef  producing  and importing  countries  as well. However  as 
a result  of a policy  of “nationalisation ” within  these European  markets,  beef  
prices  have been restored  to near pre-B.S.E.  levels.  Unfortunately  this is not 
the case with Irish beef prices.  The further  decline  in buying  power  of third  
country  markets  and the virtual  closure  of the Russian  market,  leave  the Irish  
Beef  Industry  at a major  cross roads.  One option  is to continue  to depend  on 
live shipping  of cattle  or to erratically  produce  commodity  type beef  for third  
country  markets.
The other  option  is to focus  on high  value  markets  on the continent.  We need  
to set about  replicating  some  of the continental  production  systems,  as we have  
a limited  number  of cattle  currently  suitable  to meet  these  continental  market  
requirements.  We have to look at our breeding  policy  and clearly  focus on 
producing  the correct  specification  cattle for these markets.  The current  
production  system  of finishing  top quality  continental  cross animals  at 3 years  
plus, which  are not suitable  for any of the premium  priced  markets  in Europe,  
cannot  continue.
The need to breed  for and correctly  feed the required  type of cattle  to meet  
the strict  market  requirements  in these  deficit  European  markets  is essential  for 
the survival  of the Irish Beef Industry.  The continued  production  of the 
“traditional ” heavy  steer/heifer,  in particular,  over the winter  period  is grossly  
inefficient.  Feed  intakes  rarely  reach  the levels  that give a consistent  liveweight  
gain,  thus failing  to produce  carcase  gains  that give  an economic  return  on feeding  
cost. Generally  the margins  obtained  from these cattle are only the slaughter  
premium.
Irish  beef  farmers  must  set in place  a strategy  to supply  the correct  specification  
animals  which  are produced  in a profitable  production  system.  The essential  
elements  of this system  are that it will promote  the most  efficient  use of feeds,  
will control  costs,  particularly  those of variable  cost inputs  such as feed, and 
will make  the most  efficient  use of the potential  of beef  cattle  across  all breeds.
The specification  of the cattle  required  (finished  weight, carcase  conformation  
and fat colour)  cannot  be met from  an extensive  grazing  production  system  alone.  
There  is a need to supplement  with quality  energy  and protein  feeds. This  
requirement  can be met from the use of quality  farm-grown  feeds,  that for the 
most  part can be produced  in Ireland,  for example,  cereals,  root crops,  oilseeds  
and pulses.
91
An essential  requirement  in producing  cattle  for such European  markets  is 
that the farmer  is not alone.  The system  needs to be operated  in partnership  
with export  licensed  meat  processing  plants  which  market  the beef  produced.  
This in turn will lead to a situation  where  regular  supply  contracts  can be set 
up between  the farmer  and the processor  for a market  led production  system.
The Keenan  System
The Keenan  Total Mixed  Ration  System  is based  on the simple  principals  
of feeding  a nutritionally  balanced  ration  (i.e. for energy,  protein,  both  quickly  
and slowly  degradable,  fibre,  minerals  and vitamins)  which  is available  to the 
cattle  on a 24 hour  basis.  This  ration  must  be mixed  and presented  to the cattle  
in a form that encourages  intake  and maintains  the ration  structure  (ration  
structure  being an essential  element  in promoting  rumen  health  and general  
animal  health  and performance).
This system when correctly  implemented  on farm will result in the 
following:-
1) Healthy  and contented  animals
2) Consistent  steady  intake
3) Good liveweight  gains
4) Reduced  days on feed
5) Very good feed efficiency
6) Better  carcase  kill-out
7) Possibility  to manipulate  earcase  characteristics
8) More  profitable  production  - lower  cost
Richard  Keenan  & Co. have,  over  the years  with  the help  of our large  customer  
base both in Ireland  and around  the world,  endeavoured  to develop  more  
profitable  beef  production  systems.  These  production  systems  have  always  had 
to take into account  the following:-
1. Type of cattle being finished  - potential  for intake  and weight  gain
2. Feeds  available
3. Quality  of forages  available
4. Relative  value  of purchased  feeds
5. Market  outlets  for beef
1. IVpe of cattle  being  finished  - Intake  and liveweight  gain potential
There are large differences  in terms of liveweight  gain, feed conversion  
efficiency  and suitability  for certain  markets  between  the various  breeds  of cattle  
available  to the farmer.  For example, when  feeding  Holstein steers  the aim should  
be to meet  their appetite  requirements  by feeding  a lower  overall  energy  in the 
ration.  High forage  inclusion  in the ration  is the assured  way of meeting  their  
requirements.  Continental  cross  cattle  with a great  potential  for liveweight  gain 
and carcase  gain should  be fed high energy  rations  achieving  high intakes  to 
reach their full genetic  potential.  See Appendix  1 for Keenan  Beef Ration  
Specification
92
2. Feeds  available
Winter  feed  planning  and budgeting  are an essential  part of a winter  finishing  
programme.  The types  of feeds  to be purchased  should  be examined  in terms  
of;-
1. Consistency  of supply
2. Quality/native  cereals  essential
3. Price
4. Storage  facilities  and storage  requirements
3. Quality  of forages  available
Quality  forages,  when included  in a T.M.R.,  have a substantial  effect  on 
lowering  the cost of the overall  ration  and in the  performance  of the cattle  being  
fed. A 60:40  ration  of forage  to concentrates  on an ad lib basis is probably  in 
most cases the most cost effective.  The inclusion  of a second  forage  always  
has a beneficial  effect  on the  ration.  Generally,  if the following  forages  are used  
intakes  will increase  and also performance;
1. Fodder/sugarbeet
2. Potatoes
3. Maize  silage
4. Whole  crop
5. Brewers  grains
4. Relative  value  of purchased  feeds
Relative  values  of feeds  must be reviewed  before  any feeding  programme  
can be implemented.  Relative  protein  and energy  values  need to be examined,  
in order  to fully evaluate  a feed being  considered.  See Appendix  2 for relative  
feed values.
5. Market  outlets  for beef
There  is a requirement  in the market  place  for younger  leaner  cattle  which  
can be supplied  on a consistent  basis.  The winter  feeding  programmes  developed  
by Keenan  are an essential  part of an overall  production  blueprint  which  needs  
to be implemented  in order to meet the specifications  for high value export  
markets  that before  now have not been met by Irish cattle.
The feeders  and producers  of cattle for these markets  need to:-
1. Have a planned  focused  breeding  policy
2. Proper  weanling  management
3. Improve  grazing  management
4. Produce  quality  forages
5. Feed to maximise  cattle  potential
6. Feed quality  ingredients
Beef  production  - The Future
Sustaining  a rewarding  margin  in winter  beef  production  in recent  years  has 
been  difficult. Present  market  outlets  particularly  to third  countries  are in turmoil.  
The continued  high prices  being  paid in marts  for quality  finished  stores  and
93
weanlings  leaves  the specialist  winter  finisher  with the difficulty  of how to 
return  a margin  from his enterprise.
Based  on the Australian  model  of “partnership  and alliances ”, whereby  co­
operation  between  all strands  of the industry  results  in reduction  of waste  and 
the production  of cattle to a tight specification  to meet high value market  
requirements,  Keenan  and Kepak  have recently  launched  the Keenan-Kepak  
Beef  Club.
The advantage  of this production  scheme  for the Keenan  customer  are;
1. Keenan  co-ordinated  efficient  production  system
2. Assured  all year round  market  for quality  fed stock
3. Guaranteed  premium  price
Keenan-Kepak  Beef  Alliance
The purpose  of the club is that Keenan  Beef  Customers,  through  a tightly  
co-ordinated  supply  group,  will supply  young  bulls and heifers  to the 
Mediterranean  market  on a fifty two week  of the year basis.  The club can be 
summarised  as follows:
1. Keenan  customers  exclusively  supplying  young  bulls and  heifers  all year 
round  to Kepak
2. Beef sold into high value continental  niche markets
3. Feeding  regime,  controlled  by Keenan  Nutrition  is based  on quality  feeds.
4. Keenan  co-ordinate  the production  and supply  of stock
5. Detailed  analysis  of slaughter  information  centralised  by Keenan  to 
further  enhance  the production  system.
Using  commonly  available  forages  and cereals  produced  on farm  and selected  
protein  balancers  both steers  and heifers  will be finished  to ensure  a white  fat 
colour.  It is also necessary  to have an even cover  of fat over the carcase,  4L 
and 4H is ideal. The colour  of the meat  also is very specific  - a light  pink  colour.  
When  all these  characteristics  are met then  the conformation  of the animal  needs  
to be of a high order  to meet the required  specification.  The animals  are sold 
into the Mediterranean  market  as full carcasses,  so poor conformation  or fat 
cover  cannot  be hidden.  The appropriate  breeding,  feeding  and management  
system  is essential  to ensure  the orderly  production  of these  high value  cattle.  
The age restriction  on both heifers  and bulls of 16 months  when slaughtered  
will easily  be met if the Keenan  production  blueprint  is followed.  The Keenan  
Blueprint  comprises  the following  areas.
1. Breeding
A structured  policy  whereby  proper  half to three-quarter  breed  continental  
cross animals  are produced  using the top A.I. or stock bulls available.  The 
possible  splitting  of the herd  between  autumn  and spring  calving  will: (a) reduce  
the work load during  busy calving  periods  and, (b) spread  the age profile  of 
cattle to allow flexibility  when selling.
Cattle  that are purchased  for this market  must  be from  sources  which  ensure  
finishing  to the proper  specification.
94
2. Management
A steady  growth  pattern  is essential  so as to avoid  a store period  in these  
cattle (see Appendix  3 for possible  systems  of production).
3. Feed
Grassland  management  and forage  production  must to be of the highest  
stardards  in order  to:
1. Maximise  animal  growth  potential
2. Reduce  costs
3. Enhance  carcase  characteristics
Young  bulls post-weaning  require  a planned  growth  phase  particularly  if 
they are housed.  The use of straw and high quality  proteins  to supplement  
available  forages  will ensure  that when  the finishing  phase  of the production  
is implemented  the cattle will:
1. Have  sufficient  frame  to carry  the overall  carcase  weight  required  within  
the age restriction.
2. Be able to respond  to the high  starch  and high  sugar  ration  that will ensure  
the colour  of the meat and fat cover.
Conclusion
Opportunities  for the beef farmer  are:
1. Availability  of cheaper  feeds.
2. Cattle  finished  at younger  ages
3. Cattle  produced  to meet specific  market  requirements
4. Development  of meaningful  partnerships  and alliances
5. Closer  farmer  to farmer  co-operation  in cattle supply  and feed supply.

The Role of Husbandry  in the 
Prevention  of Lameness  in Sheep
M. L. DOHERTY
Faculty  of Veterinary  Medicine,  University  College  Dublin.
The important  causes  of lameness  in sheep  and the role of husbandry  in the 
control  of lameness  are discussed  in this paper.  Footrot  is the most  economically  
significant  cause  of lameness  in Irish sheep  and particular  discussion  will be 
devoted  to that disease.
Footrot
Risk factors
Good  husbandry  of sheep  is synonymous  with good welfare.  Footrot  is a 
common,  injfectious  condition  which  has long been  associated  with  the welfare  
of sheep.  Over  50% of lowland  lambs  can be lame  with footrot  if the weather  
and pasture  conditions  are suitable.  Breed  susceptibility  is a well-known  feature  
and Down  breeds,  in particular  the Suffolk,  are more  susceptible  than  crossbred  
sheep.  Most  hill breeds  are less susceptible  while  the Merino  breed  is notoriously  
susceptible.  The prevalence  of footrot  in hill sheep  is generally  low. Footrot  
prevalence  varies  with rainfall  and temperature  and also on the concentration  
of sheeps ’ feet on pasture  (stocking  density).  Prevalence  is highest  in warm,  
wet weather  when  there  are many  ewes  and lambs  together  i.e. lowland  flocks  
in the spring  and autumn.  Sheep  with footrot  suffer  chronic  pain, they have  
reduced  liveweight  gain (equivalent  to a loss of 0.5kg/week  in the fattening  
lamb)  and reduced  wool  growth. Importantly,  ewes  with  footrot  in late pregnancy  
are more  likely  to develop  twin  lamb  disease. Despite  the availability  of a number  
of treatments,  footrot  remains  a significant  problem  and it also represents  a 
significant  animal  welfare  issue. Welfare  issues  are prominent  in the public  
domain  and the day may soon arrive  when marketability  of lamb or the 
application  of headage  payments  may partially  depend  on appropriate  attention  
to prevention  of lameness  on sheep  farms
The causative  organisms
Footrot  is caused  by the dual infection  of Fusobacterium  necrophorum  and 
Dichelobacter  nodosus.  Fusobacterium  is found  in the environment,  has many  
hosts  and represents  an ever-present  risk. Ten different  strains  of Dichelobacter  
have  been  recognised  and individual  flocks  are usually  affected  by two or more  
of these  serotypes.  Carrier  sheep  acting  as reservoirs  of infection  are the most  
significant  means  of transmission.  These  carrier  sheep  are often  recovered  cases  
or sheep  with low grade  chronic  foot rot. Dichelobacter  is confined  to the feet 
and can survive  for only short  periods  (up to 2 weeks)  on the ground.  It can 
also be earned  by cattle,  deer  and possibly  horses.  Both  bacteria  require  warmth  
and moisture,  both are anaerobic  i.e. they thrive  in tissue  unexposed  to the air, 
and both are sensitive  to chemicals.
97
The disease
Two clinical  forms  of footrot  have been described.  These  are virulent  or 
“classical ” footrot  and benign  or non-progressive  footrot. Virulent  footrot  begins  
between  the cleats  with the production  of red, foul-smelling  material  and leads  
to separation  of the horn from heel to toe. This results  in severe  lameness,  loss 
in thrive  and the characteristic  “praying  posture ”. In benign  footrot  there is 
slight heel separation  only.
The theory  of control  of footrot
The principles  of control  of foot rot are based  on factors  associated  with  
the bacteria,  host factors  associated  with the sheep  and factors  associated  with  
the environment.
1. Bacterial  factors.  Control  is based on reducing  the level of bacterial  
challenge  by foot-paring,  footbaths,  antibiotics,  vaccination,  segregation  and 
culling.  The use of clean  pasture/premises  {Helicobacter  survives  a maximum  
of 2 weeks  outside  host) is a very important  principle  in this context.
2. Host factors.  Emphasis  is placed  on increasing  flock resistance  by 
vaccination,  selective  breeding.
3. Environmental  factors.  Provision  of adequate  dry, bedding  at housing  
is important.  Land  drainage  may need  consideration.  Housed  sheep  are at risk 
if the bedding  is not kept  clean  and dry. Sheep  outdoors  are at risk during  warm,  
moist  weather  when  footrot  and scald  are readily  transmitted  through  the flock.
Prevention  of footrot
The methods  available  for prevention  and treatment  of footrot  include  
footparing,  footbathing  with 3% formalin,  or 10% zinc sulphate,  antibiotic  
therapy  and vaccination.
Footparing
Reluctance  to handle  and pare pregnant,  housed  ewes is associated  with a 
fear that the handling  may precipitate  abortion.  However,  pregnant  ewes can 
be examined  and treated  successfully  by, either,  lifting  the leg with the ewe 
restrained  standing  against  a wall,  or carefully  putting  the ewe on her side using  
the “neck flexed  back on flank ” technique  to examine  the foot. For sheep  at 
other  times  of the year,  the use of a cradle  which  enables  the sheep  to be turned  
and dealt with without  bending  is a great benefit.
A good pair of fpot-clippers  and a sharp  penknife  are all that are required.  
The foot and claw should  be cleaned  of any mud  or manure,  and any obviously  
loose horn trimmed  away. Sheep  may also be walked  through  a water  bath.  
Trimming  should  be radical  to remove  all loose.and  dead horn but should  not 
be excessive.  In particular,  care must be taken not to cut too deeply  near the 
toe. Trimming  too hard  back  leading  to excessive  bleeding  at the toe is a common  
fault  and may lead  to the development  of “toe fibroma ” which  never  heal without  
radical  treatment.  Paring  should  be sufficient  to tidy up the foot to allow  air 
access  to the deeper  tissues  (N.B. the bacteria  are anaerobic)  and allow  
penetration  of footbath  chemicals.
Footbaths
Footbathing  is a traditional  method  for treatment  and control  of footrot.  When
98
earned  out effectively  it is a very valuable  technique.  The traditional  footbaths  
used are Formalin  3%, Zinc sulphate  10%, (Stand-in  time 2-10 minutes).  The 
use of footbaths  should  be preceded  by paring  and followed  by drying  on hard  
surface  for one hour. The penetration  of Zinc sulphate  may be enhanced  by 
using  a penetrating  agent  such as sodium  lauryl  sulphate.  This requires  a long  
stand-in  time (30-60  minutes)  for full benefit  so a large foot bath is required  
for many  sheep.  This penetrating  agent  also prevents  blood  clotting  so bleeding  
should  be minimal  when  paring.  Foaming  may prevent  the sheep  from  entering  
the bath.
Antibiotics
The judicious  use of antibiotics  topically  (aerosol)  and parenterally  (by 
intramuscular  injection)  has an important  role in the treatment  of acute  cases  
of footrot  in the context  of an overall  control  programme.
Vaccines
There  are 10 different  strains  of helicobacter.  The vaccine  can be used in 
face of outbreak.  Avoid  vaccinating  ewes between  4 weeks  prior  and 4 weeks  
after  lambing.  Lambs  can be vaccinated  at 4 weeks  of age. There  may be severe  
local reactions  at the site of injection  and duration  of immunity  is relatively  
short-lived  at approximately  12 weeks.
Why does footrot  continue  to be such a problem?
The primary  reasons  for failure  of prevention  programmes  may include  
haphazard  attempts  at control  in association  with inefficient  paring,  inadequate  
footbathing  and/or  antibiotic  therapy.
Timing  of treatment  is important
Australian  research  has illustrated  that any treatment  is less effective  if it 
is applied  when  the disease  is actively spreading  through  the flock. It is important  
therefore  to treat at time of the year when  the disease  is not active  and ideally  
to target the treatment  prior to an expected  period  of disease  transmission.  
Treatment  is less effective  if applied  during  the period  of disease  spread.  Using  
this information,  a “Blitz Tactical  Treatment ” regime  has been studied  at the 
Moredun  Research  Centre  in Scotland.  Treatment  was applied  prior to an 
identified  period  of risk, in this case,  at housing  before  lambing.  All sheep  were  
footbathed  for two minutes  in 10% zinc sulphate.  All sheep  with affected  feet 
were pared and received  an intramuscular  injection  of combined  penicillin-  
streptomycin.  A second  treatment  group  received  the same  treatments  plus footrot  
vaccination.  A further  group  of untreated  animal  was monitored  as controls.
A treatment  programme  based  on this Moredun  trial with blitz treatment  
once or twice  a year should  reduce  the prevalence  of the infection  within  the 
flock  to a level  at which  disease  spread  does not occur,  even  at times  favorable  
for transmission.  This type of programme  would  greatly  reduce  the time and 
money  spent  continually  treating  individually  affected  sheep  during  outbreaks  
of footrot, provide  a more  efficient  use of resources  and improve  both  the welfare  
and productivity  of the animal  itself.
99
Eradication  of footrot  Is it a feasible  option?
Vast  areas  of New  South  Wales  in Australia  are now footrot  free.  Eradication  
requires  time,  commitment  and complete  dedication.  It may not be feasible  for 
many  farmers.  An eradication  programme  should  begin  when  the disease  is not  
actively  spreading.  All feet need to be examined.  Those  sheep  that are normal  
are designated  to a ‘clean ’ main flock. Those  with footrot  are designated  to 
a “hospital ” flock.  The sheep  in the clean  flock  are separated  from  the hospital  
flock,  footbathed  and moved  to clean grazing  (a pasture  that has not carried  
sheep  seven days).
The sheep in the hospital  group have their feet pared,  are treated  with  
antibiotics  and footbathed  or treated  topically  with  oxytetracycline  spray.  These  
sheep  are then moved  to a separate  clean  pasture.  They  are re-examined  5 days  
later, retreated  where  necessary  and re-footbathed  before  being removed  to 
another  clean  paddock.  At 10 days  the main  clean  flock  is gathered  re-footbathed,  
any infected  sheep  transferred  to the hospital  flock and the remainder  of the 
flock then moved  to a further  clean grazing.
At this time the hospital  group  is re-gathered  and inspected  and any cured  
and sound  sheep are transferred  to the main flock. The remainder  are re- 
footbathed  and returned  to either  the same  pasture  or preferably  clean  pasture.  
Ten days later,  the clean  group  are re-inspected  and re-footbathed.  The hospital  
group is examined  and all sound  sheep are added  to the clean flock. The 
remaining  sheep which  have not recovered  or still show lesions  are culled.  
Culling  of chronically  infected  sheep is the key to the eradication  of 
footrot.
Vaccination  can be assisted  in an eradication  programme,  all sheep  being  
vaccinated  at the time of the first gather.  Such vaccination  will often shorten  
the time required  to cure the hospital  flock and on occasions  if a severe  
culling policy is to be adopted  the whole operation  can be finalised  
in 154 days.
Recent  reports  of “severe  footrot ” in sheep
The year 1997 was a particularly  bad year for foot rot, particularly  in the 
period  August  to September.  The meteorological  conditions  for those  months  
in 1997,  warm,  wet weather  were  ideal for the spread  of footrot.  Two bacteria  
{F. necrophorum  and spirochaetes)  associated  with severe  footrot  in cattle  
“superfoul ” were  isolated  from  sheep  in these  severe  virulent  cases.  The affected  
sheep  were from farms  where  cattle and sheep  were held together  and where  
there was a history of Mortellaro  in the cattle. Few of the flock were  
vaccinated.
Foot scald
Foot scald is a superficial  inflammation  of the skin between  the cleats  and 
is caused  by Fusobacterium  necrophorum.  Scald sometimes  occurs  as an 
outbreak  in young  lambs  grazing  on wet, warm  or sometimes  icy pasture  causing  
substantial  lameness.  It can also be a significant  problem  in housed  sheep.  It 
can be controlled  using  footbathing  and or the topical  use of antibiotics;  paring  
and vaccination  have no role to play in the prevention  of foot scald.
100
White  line disease
Separation  of horn  from  sensitive  laminae.  The white  line becomes  impacted  
with dirt particularly  towards  the toe. Responds  well to paring.
Foot abscess
Usually  affects  only one foot. A severe  lameness  which  is associated  with  
penetration  of the foot by a foreign  body. The joint inside  the claw becomes  
infected.  Pus fistulates  out above  the coronary  band.  This may be a problem  
on stubble  fields and may require  culling  or surgical  amputation.
Joint  ill in lambs
Joint ill is an infectious  arthritis.  In young  lambs  infection  usually  gains  
entry via the navel.  In tick areas,  concurrent  tick-borne  infections  predispose  
lambs  to this disease.  Joint  ill in younger  lambs  is caused  by E. coli  and erysipelas  
infection.  Control  depends  on hygiene  in the lambing  area and navel  treatment  
with tincture  of iodine.  The incorporation  of the erysipelas  vaccine  may be 
worthwhile  in flocks  where  the significance  of that  disease  has been  established.  
However,  severe  problems  have occurred  in flocks  where  hygiene  is excellent  
and other  organisms  other  than the ones mentioned  e.g. Streptococci  may be 
involved  in those  cases.  Erysipelas  generally  affects  lambs  greater  than  2 months  
of age. It is associated  with  docking  and castration  and may  be a problem  where  
pig slurry  has been spread  on pasture.
Post-dipping  lameness
Caused  by eryspipelas  and associated  with use of Organophosphate  dips.  
The older phenolic  dips were bacteriostatic.  A sudden  outbreak  of severe  
lameness  may occur  2-5 days after dipping.  Up to 80% of the flock may be 
affected.  It mainly  affects  the forelegs,  the feet may be hot and the skin above  
coronary  band  swollen.  Control  is based  on reducing  soil contamination  of the 
dipper  and the use of dip bacteriostats  such  as zinc sulphate  at 1:1000.  Vaccination  
may be an option  in flocks  where  it is a particularly  severe  problem
Vitamin  E/Se deficiency  myopathy
Risk factors  include  selenium  deficient  pastures.  Vitamin  E deficient  diets  
such as weathered  hays,  moist  or preserved  grains,  root crops.  Lameness  may 
be seen in older  lambs  (3-6 months)  and there may be also be ill thrift, with  
generalised  stiffness,  trembling  and exercise  intolerance.  Treatment  is based  
upon the use of injectable  Se-vitamin  E preparations.  Ewes  can be treated  in 
late pregnancy  and neonatal  lambs  can be treated  with the injections  repeated  
at three months  of age.
Osteochondrosis
This is a degenerative  change  in articular  and growth  plate  cartilage  and is 
associated  with  rapid  growth,  particularly  in pedigree  ram lambs,  at 5-8 months.  
There  is no consistent  evidence  of genetic  heritabilty.  Dietary  factors  such as 
high calcium  diet to ewes  may also have a role. Intermittent  chronic  lameness  
involving  the shoulder,  elbow  and hock  joints  is produced.  There  is little or 
no heat or swelling  of the joints.

Putting  Profit  Back  Into Sheep  Farming
J. E. VIPOND
Scottish  Agricultural  College,  Animal  Biology  Division,  Bush Estate,  
Penicuik,  Midlothian  EH26  OPH, Scotland.
A severe  downturn  in the financial  viability  of UK sheep  farming  occurred  
in 1998.  Contributing  factors  include  a 30%  reduction  in lamb  and hogget  values  
from  a year ago. Finished  lamb  prices  fell during  the third  quarter  of 1997 and 
again  in the third  quarter  of 1998.  Breeding  ewe values  have also fallen  in the 
UK by up to 50% of the previous  year ’s value and cull ewes are down £15 
per head, a similar  percentage  reduction.
Other  changes  in the economic  background  include  increases  over  the year 
in labour  costs  of around  7% but a fall in cereal  prices  to around  £70 per tonne  
(11%  reduction  on the year).  However,  currently  there  are high  prices  for forage  
and straw and the unit cost of energy  is currently  lower  in concentrates  than 
in forage  which  is an exceptional  circumstance.
While  some  of these  fluctuations  in prices  may be short  term,  in the medium  
term the outlook  is for continuing  pressure  on profitability  owing  to a strong  
currency,  increased  competition  through  the reduction  in tariff  barriers  owing  
to the GATT  agreements  and in particular  competition  from  New  Zealand  chilled  
lamb which  is directly  competing  with fresh home produced  hogget  during  
January  to June.  Lamb  is currently  positioned  in the market  in the luxury  sector  
along  with the better  cuts of beef. However,  over the long term,  reductions  in 
beef  prices  resulting  from low cereal  prices  and the cessation  of slaughtering  
of bull calves  under  the BSE compensation  scheme  will occur.
There  is therefore  an urgent  need to address  the relevant  technical  issues  
for reducing  the costs of lamb production.  This paper  draws  on experience  of 
New Zealand  farming  techniques  seen as a result  of a Stapledon  Fellowship.
Are we using  the right breeds  and genetic  improvement  techniques?
UK sheep  breeding  has concentrated  on carcase  traits. However,  in NZ 
farmers  can also select  on EBVs  for wool  production  and resistance  to worms.  
With  wool  prices  depressed  there  is little  interest  currently  in improving  quality  
or yield but resistance  to parasites  and ‘easy care ’ attributes  are of interest.  In 
New  Zealand  research  workers  (McEwan  etai, 1997;  Morris  etai,  1998)  have  
concentrated  on achieving  a low flock  faecal  worm  egg count.  Their  research  
programme  started  with an estimation  of the heritability  of this trait (0.23)  and 
its correlation  with production  traits. Unfortunately,  challenged  lambs  with a 
low egg count  tend to be more daggy  and have lower  fleece  weight.  There  
followed  development  of an overall  production  and disease  resistance  index  
with its application  to the industry.  In addition  a blood  test based  on nematode  
antibodies  (marketed  by AgVax  as the Blood  Antibody  Host Resistance  Test)  
has been developed.  Despite  the negative  correlations  over 50 farmers  are 
actively  using the selection  indices  in New Zealand.
102
Results  have  been  favourable.  Those  farmers  operating  the selection  process  
for the longest  (10 years)  demonstrated  significant  reductions  in worm  egg output  
from  ewes  and lambs  with improved  wool  production  and higher  growth  rates.  
Genetic  links are made  by rotating  rams between  farms.  Currently  30 flocks  
are involved  in 3 separate  sire referencing  schemes,  as well  as some  20 unlinked  
flocks.  In 1997 more  than 7000 two tooth  and older  rams retained  for sale or 
use within  the reference  flocks  were  ranked  on the index  in these  three  schemes.  
BLUP  repeated  trait animal  model  analysis  is used to remove  environmental  
effects  between  farms,  years  and sexes.  No evidence  for problems  of genotype  
X environment  interactions  has been reported.
The benefits  to production  mainly  come from reduced  levels of pasture  
contamination  and challenge  owing  to lower  faecal  egg output.  Around  10% 
of recorded  sires  were  sold  in 1995  with  information  on their  resistance  to worms,  
seen as valuable  to commercial  farmers  buying  rams.  The high uptake  of the 
work  which  was carried  out at AgResearch,  Invermay  has been  due to the close  
contact  between  researchers  and farmers  in the development  of the selection  
programme.
Work is ongoing  in NZ to identify  markers  for the genes  responsible  for 
parasite  resistance  (Crawford  et al, 1997).  Major  genes  are also known  to operate  
in UK breeds,  e.g. the Blackface,-conferring  resistance  to worms  (Schwaiger  
et al., 1998).  Thus  it may not be necessary  to import  sheep  to gain the genetic  
benefits  in the future.
Many  New Zealand  farmers  have practiced  rigorous  culling  to eliminate  
problems  such  as lambing  difficulty,  mismothering  and metabolic  disorders  with  
rapid  reductions  in the incidence  of these  time-consuming  problems.  Farmers  
also  practice  lambing  methods  that respect  natural  sheep  behaviour,  minimising  
disturbance  and achieving  better  bonding  between  ewes and lambs,  resulting  
in less mismothering  (Geenty,  1997).  This  has allowed  an increase  in the typical  
number  of sheep per farm from 2,200 in 1981 to 3,300 in 1998 without  
compromising  health/welfare.
Can we make  more  use of grassland?
Should  the sheep industry  adapt  New Zealand  inspired  extended  grazing  
seasons,  feed wedges  and control  systems  based  on DM/ha  as leading  farmers  
in the dairy industry  have?  In practice,  few NZ sheep  farmers  use DM/ha  for 
management  decisions.  Most rely on sward  height  for day to day decisions  
about  moving  stock  and pasture  control.  Estimates  of DM/ha  are mainly  used  
in all grass wintering  systems  typically  involving  100 paddocks  and daily  shifts.  
These  are operated  from  the post-mating  period  to late pregnancy  to ration  grass  
and build  up pasture  cover,  often  involving  groups  of over 1,000  ewes  (Geenty,  
1994).  Scaling  this down to our flock sizes would  increase  fencing  costs.  
Questions  arise about  the ability  of our soil types to withstand  such stocking  
pressures  and in wet weather  welfare  could be compromised.
One element  of this system  that has immediate  application  is the use of grass  
to provide  late pregnancy  nutrition.  This has already  been incorporated  into 
May  lambing  systems  (Vipond  and Mitchell,  1996).  May  lambing  systems  have
103
effectively  cut feed costs in recent  years but cheaper  concentrates  and lower  
finished  prices  for lambs  have  reduced  their  attractiveness  and those  practising  
May  lambing  currently  justify  it on reduced  fixed  costs  (mainly  labour). Current  
New Zealand  technologies  worth  exploring  in pasture  based  systems  include  
seedhead  and weed  suppression  in pastures  using  ultra-low  glyphosate  treatment  
and on-farm  monitoring  of faecal  egg counts  (nematode  worms).  This  can reduce  
reliance  on anthelmintic  usage to control  worms  and delay development  of 
anthelmintic  resistance.
The way forward  - current  systems
Current  lowland  systems  are characterised  by an overemphasis  on breeding  
objectives  towards  meat characteristics  - growth  rate and conformation  - in 
relation  to what the market  is currently  paying  for these traits. Where  these  
developments  increase  the labour  element  of keeping  sheep,  e.g. extreme  
conformation  associated  with lambing  difficulty  or increased  cost caused  by 
lack of milk in ewes and the need for supplementary  colostrum,  then we are 
locked  into an unprofitable  business.  Tinkering  with  such  a basically  unprofitable  
system  is not likely  to put it back into profitability.  Major  cutbacks  in inputs  
of feeds  or medicines  can quickly  become  counterproductive.  Useful  savings  
can be made  however  by monitoring  for diseases,  trace element  deficiencies  
and underfeeding,  knowing  the value of feeds and efficacies  of supplements  
and medicines  and making  the appropriate  inputs  on the basis  of this information  
and knowledge  of requirements.
New systems
We could  take a useful  lead from the dairy industry  and look at how we 
measure  economic  success  by throwing  out gross  margin  analysis  which  ignores  
fixed costs and looking  at total costs of production  in pence  per kg of lamb  
sold. We need also new indicators  of efficiency.  Biological  expressions  such  
as kg DM fed per ewe wintered  could be borrowed  from New Zealand  and 
modified  to our subsidised  systems.  Indicators  that are currently  more  relevant  
include  identification  of those  costs  critical  to ensure  annual  headage  payment.  
Dry sheep  farming  in remote  hill areas may be the most profitable  option  at 
current  low lamb and cast ewe values.  Most farmers  will be uncomfortable  
with such developments.  However,  they reduce  the power  of the large-scale  
multiples  who have become  beneficiaries  of subsidised  agriculture  because  
farmers  provide  them  with products  at less than the cost of production  through  
the subsidies  they receive.
The details  of profitable  new sheep  farming  systems  are not clear  but their  
elements  can be identified.  These  include  higher  product  prices  based  on:
• Costs of production.
• Selling  lambs  under  the EU initiative  for Protected  Designations  of Origin  
and Protected  Geographical  Indication.
• Farm assurance  and organic  premiums.
• Group  marketing  schemes  on a regional  basis.*
• Use of sheep  with  genetic  and behavioural  characteristics  that reduce  labour  
input.

• More  use of grass  as a feed, reduced  inputs  of animal  medicines,  supplements  
and labour.
• Re-direction  of the focus in sheep farming  towards  providing  the 
environmental  and social  benefits  derived  from keeping  sheep.
The challenge  is to achieve  these objectives  without  a major  reduction  in
the rural population.
