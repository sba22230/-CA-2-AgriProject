The Purchase  For Destruction  (PFD)  Scheme
JARLATH  COLEMAN
Principal  Officer,  Beef  Mari<et  Supports  Division,  DAFRD,
Johnstown  Castle,  Co Wexford.
1. ELI Regulation
Commission  Regulation  (EC) No 2777/2000,  which provides  for exceptional  support  
measures  for the  Beef Market  came  into force  on 1 January  2001. The measures  were  
negotiated  at EU level late last year in the context  of the BSE related  difficulties  facing  
the beef sector, and were designed  to restore  consumer  confidence  in beef and to 
provide  an effective  market  support  for cattle. The regulation  provides  for testing  for 
BSE and the destruction  of animals  over thirty months  of age up to July 1
1.1 Testing
From the 1 January  all animals  over 30 months  entering  the food chain must be tested.  
Non-tested  animals  must be destroyed.  The EU provides  funding  of 15 Euro per animal  
tested. Animals  over 30 months  which  have been  tested  negatively,  are not allowed  into 
the destruction  scheme  except where derogation  is given under the EU Beef  
Management  Committee  procedure.  Where tested animals  enter the destruction  
scheme,  the EU will not fund the test.
1.2 Destruction
The basic  prices  paid by Member  States  to producers  or their agents  for cattle  submitted  
under the scheme  is based on the standard  EU dressed  carcase  weights  and the 
average  price  for each  category  and quality  within  that category  in a four week  reference  
period,  6 November  - 1 December.  The weighted  average  price or flat price for each 
category  is calculated  on the basis of 1999 classification  data on grades  and weights.  
The average  price paid for each category  in a number  of selected  member  states is 
outlined  in table 1.

Table  1. Flat rate prices  for cows and steers  in selected  member  states  under  the PFD scheme
The regulation  provides  for the upward  adjustment  of these prices by 5% subject  to 
market  conditions.  EU financing  does not apply  to this amount.  Any adjustment  above  
5% or below the basic price can only be made upon prior approval  from the 
Commission.  The 5% increase  has been applied  in Ireland  for steers and heifers.
Prices  for each of the 28 grades  within  each of the four categories  are published  weekly  
(see Annex  1). The current  prices  in Ireland  for a selected  grade  within  each category  
are as follows:
Steer R3 91.2 p/lb (including  VAT @ 4.3%)
Heifer R3 91.6 p/lb
Cow 03 57.7 p/lb
Prices  are subject  to weekly  review.
Eligible  Animals
Animals  over 30 months  of age, and which  have not undergone  a test can be offered  for 
slaughter  and destruction  by any producer.  Only animals,  which  have been present  on 
a holding  in a Me.mber  State for at least six months  and have been passed  fit for 
slaughter  for hL.man  consumption,  are permitted  into the scheme.
Operation  And Financing
The EU provides  70% of the standard  flat rate price of the animal,  with all other costs 
borne  by the national  authorities.  In the operation  and control  of the scheme  very strict 
conditions  apply:  there must be total separation  of animals  and products  entering  PFD 
from animals  entering  the food chain; all parts of the animal  entering  PFD must be 
rendered,  the only part excepted  is the hide which  can be sent for tanning  but must be 
treated  separately  from non-PFD  hides;  the trimmings  fatty tissue  etc, on the hide must 
be destroyed.  A EU advance  of 80% can be claimed  once  all products  from the animals  
on which  the claim is made are rendered  and the hide disposed.  The balance  can be 
claimed  when the meat and bone meal is incinerated.  Administrative  and on the spot 
checks  must be carried  out to verify  that all relevant  products  have been rendered  and 
fully destroyed.
Operation  of the scheme  in Ireland
The Department  of Agriculture,  Food and Rural Development  administers  the scheme  
in Ireland  within its Market  Supports  Division  in Johnstown  Castle and through  the 
network of veterinary  and agricultural  
officers located throughout  the country.
These  staff ensure  that every aspect  of the 
scheme  - at abattoir,  rendering  plant, cold 
store, meat and bone meal store, tannery, 
etc, - are strictly  controlled  to ensure  that the 
requirements  of the EU Regulations  are 
fulfilled. The location of the various  
participating  plants  involved  in the scheme  is 
given in Figure 1, while the flow chart in 
Figure  2 provide  an outline  of the process  
involved  along  the chain  to final destruction.
Each stage of this process involves  
controlled scheduling  to overcome  
bottlenecks,  etc. to allow for the scheme  toFigure  1. The locations  of the various

operate  efficiently.  Accordingly,  there is a daily limit imposed  in the number  of cattle,  
which can be slaughtered  in each abattoir. This limit may be reduced  if the outlet  for 
PFD material  at any stage  further  along  the chain  is limiting.  All PFD material  from each  
day’s slaughtering  must be removed  from the abattoir,  including  the hide.

Slaughterings  under  the scheme
Since the scheme  commenced  on January  10, 41432  cattle have been slaughtered  up 
to February  2. A breakdown  by category  is given in table 2.

This table shows  that the average  weight  of steers  and heifers  entering  the scheme  are 
substantially  higher  than the average  weight  of all slaughterings  within  these  categories  
in 2000. Some  of this variation  would  be accounted  for by over 30 month  animals  being 
naturally  heavier  than the average  of all cattle  in that category.  Weight  gain arising  from 
the delay in slaughtering  would also account  for the increase.  A breakdown  of the 
average  weight  for each category  of animal  submitted  under the scheme  in the first 
three  weeks  in the scheme  is given in table 4.

conformation  figures  for steers  in 2000.
PFD kill projections
The number  of cattle which enter the PFD scheme  under the terms of the current  
regulation  which expires  at the end of June, will amongst  other  factors  be determined  
by the market  situation  in the EU, availability  of third country  markets  and the level of 
market  supports  available  under intervention  and export refunds. Recent  estimates  
from the Commission  show a major drop in consumption  in the EU. In addition  a 
considerable  backlog  of production,  which should  normally  have taken place in 2000,  
has been carried  over into 2001. The number  of cattle entering  the scheme  will of 
course,  be a function  of the number  of over 30 month  animals  coming  on the market  and 
the level of BSE testing  carried  out on those  animals.
No of animals  over  30 months
The Department ’s CMMS  data shows  that over half of all animals  slaughtered  in export  
and domestic  abattoirs  in 2000  were over 30 months  of age. This is shown  in Table  6.

If the cattle supply  pattern  is somewhat  similar  this year as in 2000 then some  430,000  
cattle, in addition  to the backlog  carried  over from 2000, would be eligible  for the 
scheme.
No of animals  tested
The total number  of animals  tested  for BSE under  the ENFER  technique  up to February  
2 is 40,429  of which  all tested  negative.  The breakdown  per week is given in table 7.

The table shows  that there is a large reduction  in the numbers  being  tested  at the end 
of January  as against  the middle  of the month. The corollary  of this is that the numbers  
of cattle  entering  the PFD scheme  has been on the increase.

Restructuring  the beef industry:  - impact  of finishing  
under  30 months
BERNARD  SMYTH  
Chief  Beef  Adviser,  Teagasc,  Grange
Introduction
This paper discusses  the relationship  between  profitability  and cattle ‘finishing  age’. 
Current  finishing  ages and reasons  for later finishing  in Ireland  is examined.  For the 
future, some implications  of finishing  progeny  from both dairy and suckler  herds  under  
30 months  is considered.
Finishing  age - maximising  profitability
To achieve  maximum  profitability  from an integrated  suckling  to beef  or dairy calf to beef 
enterprise,  high animal performance,  cost efficient  production  and optimisation  of 
premia  must be attained.  The optimum  finishing  age to achieve  maximum  profit for a 
spring calving  herd is at 20 months  for heifers  off grass,  and 23 - 24 months  for steers  
at the end of the second  winter. Some  farms  with suckler  herds  can also achieve  near 
maximum  profit when steers  are let out to grass  in spring  at 22 - 23 months  of age and 
finished  off grass at 28 months  of age. [NB. Present  and future  market  requirements  
dictate  all animals  must be finished  before  30 months  of age].
Irish cattle herd
The CSO data in Table 1 shows  the Irish cattle population  at approximately  7.2 million  
head in June  2000,  which  includes  almost  1.3 million  dairy  cows  and just over 1.1 million  
other  cows. Animals  2 years  of age or older  amount  to 792,100  males,  which  represents  
approximately  75-80%  of spring 1998 live male calvings,  and 345,700  heifers  which  
represents  approximately  35% of spring  1998 live female  calvings.

Source  - Central  Statistics  Office
December  2000 figures  show the national  herd at its lowest  level since 1995 at just 
fewer  than 6.5 million  head. Males  and females  over 2 years  are down approximately  
42,000  and 37,000  head respectively  compared  with December  1999 levels. Cattle  1- 
2 years  are down  over 180,000  head compared  with December  1999,  while  cattle  under  
1 year are up 40,000  head.
Finishing  age - present  position
Data from the CMMS  on the age profile  of animals  slaughtered  in 2000 (source  DAFRD) 
shows  the challenge  that exists  for Irish farmers  to ensure  that future  slaughterings  are 
achieved  before  dairy and suckler  herd progeny  reach 30 months.  Table  2 shows  total 
slaughterings  for 2000 as captured  in the CMMS  and the breakdown  in each age 
category,  and also shows  a Teagasc  estimated  breakdown  by age category  when  cows  
slaughterings  are excluded.

*CMMS  data from DAFRD
**Teagasc  estimate  assuming  360,000  cow slaughterings  all over 36 months  of age
Table 2 shows  that 60% of slaughterings  excluding  cows in 2000 are achieved  before  
animals  reach  30 months  of age and up to 40% of slaughterings  of steers  or heifers  at 
over 30 months.  Animals  (other  than cows)  slaughtered  at over 36 months  only amount  
to 13% and will present  the greatest  challenge  at farm level to have  them  fit for slaughter  
at least 14 to 15 month  earlier. Up to 27% of animals  slaughtered  between  30 to 36 
months  (average  age 33 months)  will need to be finished  at least  4 to 5 months  earlier. 
This will require  extra concentrate  input where  grazing  management  and grass  quality  
are not up to a high standard.

Table 3 looks  at the disposal  pattern  in 2000 up to June 30‘f' and from July to December.  
As would be expected  with a predominantly  spring calving  herd the age profile of 
slaughterings  gets older as the year progresses  with up to 38% of steer and heifer  
slaughterings  in July to December  aged between  30-36 months. This represents  
approximately  277,000  steers  and heifers  slaughtered  in the second  half of the year  that 
would need to be finished  at least 4 to 5 months  earlier. There  was little difference  in 
slaughterings  of steers  and heifers  in the 36 to 48 month  age category  between  the two 
halves  of 2000.
Reasons  for later  finishing  in Ireland
The small number  of integrated  breeding  and finishing  farms  within  both dairy and beef 
herds,  combined with too many  farm movements  in the animals  lifetime  extends  the time 
required  to achieve  adequate  finish beyond  30 months. Farm movements  can often  
result in an extended  store period  that significantly  effects  days to slaughter.
High calf/store  prices relative  to Irish beef prices, encouraged  later finishing  that 
included  the maximum  period  at grass to keep costs down, and to achieve  a higher  
carcass  weight  to spread  the calf/store  cost.
The attraction  of animals  with compensatory  growth  (following  a store period  with poor 
performance)  to finishers,  presented  a better prospect  for profit when age at finishing  
was not a marketing  issue.
Implications  of finishing  under  30 months
In the short-term,  in many situations  there will be increased  costs to get the present  
animals  approaching  30 months  finished  some 4-6 months  earlier  than previously.  A 
critical  group is animals  born in March  and April 1999 that will reach 30 months  by the 
end of August  and September  respectively  this year. Table  4 shows  the critical  dates  
when animals  arrive  at 30 months  up to January  2002.

Animals  approaching  30 months  should be grouped  according  to age and a feed 
strategy  put in place  to ensure  finish  before  30 months  in order  to increase  sale options.  
Additional  costs will only be justified  where  market  prices  for under  30 month  animals  
exceeds  the price for over 30 month  animals.  At present  (Feb. 2001)  markets  are weak  
with under  30 months  price below  PFD price but as the year progresses  extra market  
outlets combined  with a recovery  in beef consumption  within the EU and any 
disimprovements  in the PFD scheme  price would change  the balance  significantly.  
From  Table  3 it can be estimated  that approximately  277,000  animals  (excluding  cows)  
aged 30 to 36 months,  with average  age 33 months,  were slaughtered  from July to 
December  2000. It can also be estimated  from December  2000 CSO data that 
approximately  200,000  head are in the pipeline  for slaughter  in July to December  2001  
in the 30 to 36 month  age bracket.  Earlier  finishing  of this group  of animals  in 2001 will 
bring additional  under  30 month  cattle  to market  some  4 to 5 months  earlier  and would  
weaken  prices  unless  significant  additional  sale outlets  become  available.  The present  
PFD scheme  is to run to June  2001 and could  have price  adjustments  between  now and 
June and will also be due for review  from then on.
Given  the present  weak markets  the incentive  is not there  to speed  up the finishing  of 
animals  to achieve  finish less than 30 months  before  the end of June next where  extra 
costs  are required  to finish  earlier. However  earlier  finishing  without  extra costs  through  
better  use of early grass  and good grazing  management  is essential  and could provide  
more marketing  options  to farms  with cattle approaching  30 months  between  now and 
June. Any review  of the PFD scheme  from July is unlikely  to maintain  the buying  price  
for steers  and heifers  at present  levels  and is a major  factor  that must be considered  
when decoding  if the risk of putting  in extra inputs  are justified,  to ensure  animals  are 
finished  some  4 to 5 months  earlier. The big question  is the market  price for under  30 
months  beef  to June compared  with PFD price for over 30 months  post July.
Medium  term impact  of earlier  finishing
Estimates  from slaughterings  in 2000 from CMMS data would indicate  that 
approximately  405,000  animals  (excluding  cows)  were slaughtered  at an average  age 
of 33 months.  Under  30 month  finishing  for this group  would  require  their sale some  4- 
5 months  earlier  which would remove  135,000  to 170,000  livestock  units from Irish 
finishing  farms. In addition,  an estimated  200,000  plus animals  with average  age 42 
months  (age group 36-48 months)  would need to be finished  some 14-15 months  
younger  which  would  remove  a further  230,000  to 250,000  livestock  units from finishing  
farms.
Achieving  the finishing  of all bullocks  and heifers  under 30 months  in future would  
remove  370,000  to 420,000  livestock  units from Irish finishing  farms. Up to now farms  
finishing  bullocks  and heifers  over 30 months  will have  to purchase  younger  stock  (dairy  
beef calves/suckler  and dairy beef weanlings)  and finish them under 30 months  or 
alternatively  purchase  suckler  quota  to supply  some  or all of their stores.
Live exports  in 2000 amounted  to approximately  400,000  head but demand  slowed  
down in the second  half of the year and may continue  at a much lower  level of demand  
in 2001. Demand  from home  finishers  for younger  cattle  has remained  very strong  and 
Irish feeders  are likely to remain  the best customers  for quality  young  stock in 2001.
10
The price of younger  cattle is seriously  out of line given  the present  beef price for cattle  
under  30 months.
Assuming  that the demand  for live exports  recovers  in 2002/03  to last years level, and 
that home finishing  of steers  and heifers  is predominantly  under  30 months,  this will 
result in a significant  reduction  in cattle livestock  units on Irish farms. This will release  
up to 0.5 million  acres  of mostly  non eligible  land that is not required  by other  livestock  
enterprises  due to quotas  on milk, ewes  and suckler  cows. Much of this land released  
will be available  for forestry,  as it will have few if any alternative  uses.
Summary
Present  and future market  requirements  dictate  that cattle must be finished  before  30 
months  of age in order  to gain access  to most markets.  Animals  over 30 months  can 
have market  access  in future  when tested  for BSE but the price is likely to be lower  
unless supplies  of under  30 month  animals  are limiting,  or if the over 30 month  beef 
meets a specific  carcass  specification  in terms of grade and carcass  weight and 
qualifies  for an extra premium.
Estimates  based on CMMS  data for slaughterings  in 2000 indicate  that 60% of Irish 
steers  and heifers  were slaughtered  under  30 months. However  in the second  half of 
2000, slaughterings  of steers  and heifers  under  30 months  only amounted  to 48% of 
total slaughterings  excluding  cows - this is to be expected  from a spring  calving  herd 
with many  steers  finishing  at 30 to 36 months  off grass. A similar  age profile  to disposals  
in 2001 will expose  a large number  of animals  to a market  price for BSE test and sell, 
or leave  them dependent  on a extended  PFD scheme  from July at possibly  a lower  price  
than at present,  or encourage  earlier  finishing  with possible  extra costs  to achieve  sale 
before  30 months.  Selecting  the best option  here is not easy  with selling  price uncertain  
in all cases  but risk can be reduced  by not having  all the eggs in the one basket.
Farmers  with cattle finishing  at present  and for the remainder  of 2001 are the most  
exposed  to present  market  difficulties  and will have to rely heavily  on the PFD scheme  
for cattle over 30 months. Based on the age profile of slaughterings  in 2000 it is 
estimated  that over 200,000  animals  normally  destined  for slaughter  in the second  half 
of 2001 would  need to have their sale date brought  forward  by some  4 to 5 months  to 
achieve  finish under  30 months.  Bringing  forward  sales  of under  30 months  cattle  onto 
an already  difficult  market  will not help sale price unless significant  market  outlets  
reopens  between  now and the summer.  Extra  costs  incurred  to achieve  the earlier  finish  
under 30 months  can only be justified  by having  a secure  outlet  compared  with facing  a 
much more uncertain  outlet  and price for cattle  over 30 months  after July 1st.
Every  effort should  be made  to finish and sell cattle  already  30 months,  or due to reach  
30 months  by June, into the present  PFS scheme  before  the end of June on the basis  
that it can be expected  to return  a better  price than any alternative  scheme  that might  
replace  it from July l^i next. Over 100,000  steers  and heifers  aged 36 to 48 months  
were slaughtered  from July to December  2000 and corresponding  animals  in 2001 will 
be over 30 months  before  June 30<fi and therefore  eligible  for present  PFS scheme.
It is possible  that by March/April  there may be indications  from the EU of how the 
present  PFD scheme  might be extended  or replaced  with alternative  market  support  
measures  and any such changes  could  change  or help clarify  the best options  available.
11
Finishers  depending  on purchased  stores  up to now for their raw material,  will need to 
change  their systems  to acquire  younger  animals  and finish  them before  they reach 30 
months.  With a much  reduced  level of live export  demand  in the short  term the supply  
of younger  stock  will be adequate  to maintain  total livestock  units on Irish farms. Profit  
levels with finishing  systems  are likely to remain tight and volatile  while efficient  
breeding  and finishing  farms  will have modest  but more stable profits. The need for 
lower  cost production  with the exploitation  of grass  management  and quality  winter  feed  
becomes  even more important  at lower  selling  prices  and are both essential  ingredients  
in finishing  under  30 months. Increased  linkage  between  breeding  and finishing  farms  
with more efficient  marketing  can help eliminate  prolonged  store periods,  which is 
essential  to facilitate  earlier finishing. Better co-operation  between  finishers  and 
processors  can ensure  beef production  systems  that supply  beef to meet the highest  
standards  required  by EU consumers  where  a viable  profit is achievable  by all involved.

Producing  cattle  under  thirty  months  old

Introduction
For many years farmers  have been encouraged  to produce  two-year-old  beef. There  
were circumstances  where finishing  cattle off grass at up to 30 months  of age was 
sometimes  a better  option  but never  has the production  of beef over 30 months  been 
recommended.  Nevertheless,  it appears  that there are a large number  of prime cattle  
over 30 months  on Irish farms. These are mainly steers. This is extraordinary  
considering  the high level of concentrate  consumption  by beef cattle nationally  which  
averages  about  0.75 1 per animal  slaughtered  (including  heifers  and cows). Over  recent  
years,  carcass  weights  have decreased  so with more  concentrates  being  fed and lighter  
carcasses;  slaughter  age would  be expected  to have declined.
While there is no reason  to believe  that prime  cattle over 30 months  pose any greater  
risk to human health than those under 30 months,  the 30 month cut off point has 
become  established  in the consciousness  of consumers,  supermarkets  and meat  
traders. Therefore,  for the time to come  only animals  under  30 months  are likely to be 
acceptable  as prime  beef. This may mean slaughter  at somewhat  lighter  weights  than 
at present,  something  which  could be desirable  as many  carcasses  are overfat  (42% of 
steers  and 47% of heifers  in fat classes  4H and 5 in 2000). Whenever  it is suggested  
that animals  should be slaughtered  younger  or lighter,  this is often interpreted  as a 
recommendation  for earlier  maturing  breed types. This is not so, all breed  types can 
produce  carcasses  of acceptable  weight  and finish at less than 30 months.
Margins  from systems
Generally  over the years, margins  per ha from cattle enterprises  increased  with 
decreasing  slaughter  age. This is still so even though  intensity  of production  is now 
fairly rigidly fixed through  the stocking  rate limits for the Special  Beef Premium,  the 
Extensification  Premium  and the Rural Environment  Protection  Scheme  (REPS).  Data 
on the economics  of the three systems  compiled  by Caffrey  (2000)  are shown  in Table  
1. All are operated  at the same level of management  and all are eligible  for REPS. 
System  1 produces  68 continental  x Friesian  steers  annually  at 24 months  with a mean  
carcass  weight  of 360 kg. The net margin  (including  REPS)  is £828/ha.  System  2 
produces  56 cattle  annually,  roughly  half at 24 months  at 360 kg carcass  weight  and half 
at 30 months  at 410 kg carcass  weight. Net margin  is £715/ha. Summer  finishing  of 
steers  to 30 months  gives  a lower  gross  margin.  Clearly,  as slaughter  age declines  from  
around  30 months  to around  24 months,  net margin  per ha increases.  Net margin  per 
animal  increases  as slaughter  age and weight  increase  but in the vast majority  of farms  
in Ireland,  land rather  than animals  is the limiting  factor  so the margin  on land should  be 
maximised.
13
Seasonality  of calf births
Date of birth influences  date of slaughter.  The distribution  of calf births by 2-month  
periods  throughout  the year and for the 3 - month  period  February  to April is shown  in 
Table  2. Almost  90% of all calves  are born in the first 6 months  of the year with almost  
70% born in the February  to April period. Differences  between  dairy and suckler  herds  
are small. More dairy cows calve in January/February  while more suckler  cows calve  
in May/June.  Over 56% of dairy calves  are born in February  and March  and over 51% 
of suckler  calves  are born in March  and April. This very pronounced  pattern  of spring  
calving  means  that approximately  80% of animals  will reach 30 months  of age before  
October  of their third year.
Complete  production  systems
Dairy  calf to beef  system  (24 months)
The target  weight  gains  and weights  for a 24-month  dairy calf to beef  system  are shown  
in Table  3. The values  for Friesians  also apply to early maturing  animals  but the latter  
would  have a shorter  finishing  winter  and a lighter  slaughter  weight. The highest  target  
weight  gain at any time throughout  life is 0.95 kg/day,  and mean  lifetime  liveweight  gains  
are 0.77 kg/day  for Friesians  and 0.82 kg/day  for continental  crosses.  These  targets  are 
not be too difficult  to achieve  but even if the final target  weights  are not achieved  by 24 
months  there is still plenty  of time to reach  them before  30 months.  Slaughter  weights  
are 615 and 660 kg for the Friesians  and continental  crosses,  respectively  giving  
corresponding  carcass  weights  of 320 and 360 kg. These  carcasses  are adequately  
finished.
Suckler  system  (24 months)
Target  weight  gains and weights  for a 21 month  (heifer)  and 24 month (steer)  spring  
calving  suckler  system  are shown  in Table  4. It is assumed  that the animals  are three-  
quarter  or more continental  crosses  and so have the potential  to be taken to heavy  
weights.  Only during  the suckling  period  at pasture  does target  liveweight  gain exceed  
1 kg/day. Mean  lifetime  liveweight  gains  are 0.89 and 0.85 kg/day  for steers  and heifers,  
respectively.  The heifers  are finished  at the end of the second  grazing  season  and over 
the early part of the second  winter  either  on concentrates  at pasture  or on silage  plus 
concentrates  indoors.  Target  slaughter  weight  for heifers  is 570 kg giving  a carcass  of 
about  310 kg. Lower  slaughter  and carcass  weights  would  be acceptable.  The steers  
are finished  at two years at a slaughter  weight  of 700 kg and a carcass  weight  of 395 
kg. Again  lower  slaughter  and carcass  weights  would  be acceptable.  As with the dairy  
bred animals,  the final liveweight  targets  are for 24 months  finishing  (steers)  so there is 
still plenty  of time to reach  the targets  before  30 months  even if some  of the production  
phase  targets  are not met.
Pasture  finishing
Since  the vast majority  of calves  are spring  born and must now be slaughtered  before  
30 months  of age, the opportunities  for finishing  off pasture  in the third grazing  season
14
are less than heretofore.  For early born (before  March)  calves,  which would be 26 
months  of age or more before  the commencement  of their third grazing  season,  there is 
little point in putting  them to pasture  - they should be finished  indoors  during their 
second  winter. Later  born (after  March)  calves  however,  could  either  be finished  indoors  
or at pasture. Target  weight  gains and weights  for late born (mid May) suckler  calves  
finished  off pasture  in their third grazing  season  are shown  in Table  5. Late born calves  
at first housing  as weanlings,  will weigh  about  250 (steers)  and 220 kg (heifers).  During  
the first winter,  performance  is the same  as for earlier  born animals.  Because  the steers  
are not being finished  over the second  winter  they can be kept at pasture  later, and 
steers and heifers  at housing  for their second  winter  weigh about 520 and 470 kg, 
respectively.  The steers  are stored  over the winter  while the heifers  are finished  for a 
100 day period  and slaughtered  in February.  The steers  which  weigh  about  590 kg are 
turned  out in early  April for an 18 week  finishing  period  at pasture  and slaughtered  at 27 
months of age. This system  can also be applied  to late born dairy calves with 
appropriate  modifications  to the targets.  In principle,  turn out for a third grazing  season  
can be considered  once  the animals  can have  about  3 months  at pasture.  If the pasture  
finishing  period is much shorter  than this then turn-out  is hardly  worthwhile  and the 
animals  should  be finished  indoors.
Partial  systems
All of the foregoing  has dealt with complete  systems  and in theory  it should  not matter  
whether  the entire production  cycle is carried  out on one farm or if each production  
phase  is carried  out on a different  farm once  the animals  achieve  their  target  weights  for 
age. In practice  however,  where  animals  are sold from one farm to another  many  are 
below the target  weight  for age. If purchased  animals  are below  the target  weight  for 
age but still must be slaughtered  before 30 months,  higher weight gains for the 
remainder  of life must be achieved  or alternatively  slaughter  weight  will be lighter.
Purchase  of weanlings
Where  differences  in growrth  occur  in early life these  largely  persist  throughout  life with 
little compensatory  growth. Thus for example,  if weanlings  are 40 kg below  target  in 
autumn,  at least 30 kg of this will remain  to slaughter.  Clearly,  if this deficit  is to be made  
up, the animals  will have  to be fed better  or retained  for longer. Alternatively,  they could 
be slaughtered  30 kg lighter. This is the equivalent  of about  16 kg carcass,  the value  of 
which is probably  less than the initial difference  of 40 kg liveweight.
Purchase  of yearlings
As animals  get older  at purchase,  less of their history  can be ascertained  as they may 
have had more than one previous  owner. If yearlings  are below  their target  weight,  it 
may be because  they were light as weanlings  or because  they performed  poorly  in the 
weanling  to yearling  period. If they were light as weanlings  but performed  normally  
afterwards  then the situation  outlined  above  for weanlings  applies.  In contrast,  if all the 
difference  in weight  resulted  from poor performance  in the weanling  to yearling  stage  
then up to three  quarter  of this will be compensated  for. In practice,  light yearling  weight
15
is probably  a combination  of both light weanling  weight  and poor performance  in the 
weanling  to yearling  stage. If for example  yearlings  are 60 kg below  their target  weight  
due to being 20 kg lighter  as weanlings  plus 40 kg less gain in the weanling  to yearling  
period,  then about 30 kg of this will be compensated  for leaving  an additional  30 kg 
which  can only be made up either  by better  feeding  or keeping  the animals  for longer.  
In many instances  the best option  might  be to slaughter  the animals  30 kg lighter. The 
value of the carcass  weight  (16 kg) difference  would  probably  be less than that of the 
original  60 kg liveweight  difference.
Purchase  of stores
Where stores are purchased  in spring at around  two years of age for finishing  at 
pasture,  there  is generally  considerable  compensatory  growth  potential  in animals  which 
are below  their liveweight  target. However,  with the 30 month  limit on slaughter  age 
there may not be sufficient  time to exploit  this compensatory  growth,  so light stores  will 
still be light at slaughter.  Such animals  may be under finished  and suffer a price 
discount.  Therefore,  the purchase  of light stores  for finishing  off pasture  should  only be 
considered  where  there is sufficient  time to finish  them adequately.
Where  stores  are purchased  in autumn  for finishing  over the winter,  light animals  can be 
expected  to show  only modest  compensatory  growth.  Therefore,  the feeding  level must 
be increased  or the finishing  period extended  if the target slaughter  weight  is to be 
achieved.  A further  option,  as in the other cases,  would be to slaughter  at a lighter  
weight. This would  have fewer  consequences  for finish and carcass  appearance  than 
slaughter  off pasture  because  of the greater  fattening  effect of winter  finishing  diets 
compared  to pasture.
Rapid  Finishing
Where  animals  approaching  the 30 month  limit are still not finished,  a period  of rapid 
finishing  on a high concentrate  diet could be considered  provided  the increment  of 
weight  gain required  is not excessive.  For animals  with reasonable  compensatory 
growth  potential  (which should be the case if they have a low weight  for age) the 
expected  daily gains  for various  intervals  during  a finishing  period  are shown  in Table  6. 
Rate of gain declines  considerably  with increasing  length  of finishing  period. For the first 
8 weeks  quite good gains are achieved  but after 16 weeks  gains are low.
The periods  required  to put on varying  increments  of liveweight  gain from 100 to 250 kg 
on animals  fed on a high concentrate  diet are shown  in Table  7. Up to 100 kg liveweight  
gain can be achieved  in 10-11  weeks  and 150 kg can be achieved  in about  17 weeks.  
Except  in exceptional  circumstances  putting  more  than 150 kg liveweight  gain on heavy  
animals  finished  on a high concentrate  diet is unlikely  to be economical.  Animals  
finished  on a high concentrate  diet generally  have a higher  kill-out  than animals  finished  
on forage  based  diets. Such animals  can therefore  be slaughtered  at a somewhat  lower  
liveweight.
16
Slaughter  age and carcass  traits
After breed type, the main factor  affecting  carcass  grades  and other carcass  traits is 
slaughter  weight. If slaughter  age must be lowered,  at least some of the animals  now 
slaughtered  off pasture  will have to be finished  indoors  at a younger  age (assuming  the 
present  spring  calving  pattern  continues).  Where  animals  were finished  indoors  at 24 
months  rather than off pasture  at 29 months  at approximately  the same slaughter  
weight,  effects  on carcass  traits were small but generally  in favour  of indoor  finishing  
(Table 8). Kill-out  was about 10 g/kg higher  for the animals  finished  indoors. Thus  
indoor finished  animals  can be slaughtered  10-15 kg lighter for the same carcass  
weight. Carcass  conformation  was marginally  improved  by indoor  finishing  and fat 
score  was somewhat  higher. However,  more objective  measures  of fatness  suggested  
that the difference  in fatness  was much greater  than indicated  by fat score. While  
increased  fatness  is rarely  desirable  the greater  fatness  of indoor  finished  animals  could 
be beneficial  in ensuring  adequate  finish in light carcasses.
Carcass  traits at various  carcass  fat classes
There appears  to be reluctance  to slaughter  earlier  because  of the consequences  for 
other slaughter  traits, which affect  value. Carcass  weights  and liveweights  at varying  
carcass  fat classes  are shown  in Table 9. Clearly,  as slaughter  and carcass  weights  
increase  so does fat class and vice versa. On average  carcass  weights  of early  
maturing,  Friesian,  continental  dairy, and continental  suckler  steers  change  by about  40, 
40, 50 and 55 kg per unit change  in fat class. The corresponding  liveweight  changes  
are 65, 60, 75 and 80 kg.
In addition  to the effects on fatness  a change  in slaughter  weight  would  also have  knock-  
on effects on kill-out  proportion  and carcass  conformation.  Kill-out  proportion  at the 
various  fat classes  is shown  in Table 10. Per unit change  in fat class,  kill-out  proportion  
changes  by about 11, 14, 15 and 16 g/kg for early maturing,  Friesian,  continental  dairy,  
and continental  suckler  steers,  respectively.  A more useful  way of expressing  it might  
be that for early maturing,  Friesian,  continental  dairy, and continental  suckler  steers  kill- 
out proportion  changes  by approximately  10 g/kg per 65, 43, 52 and 52 kg change  in 
slaughter  weight for the breed  types  as listed. The data shown  in Tables  9 and 10 imply  
that change  is linear. This is not so but it is difficult  to find another  way of describing  the 
changes.  For example,  when animals  are light and lean, kill-out  increases  rapidly  with 
increasing  weight. Thereafter,  the rate of increase  slows  down.
Carcass  grades vary widely between  experiments  and between  groups  of similar  
animals  slaughtered  at different  times. This is particularly  true for conformation  making  
it difficult to estimate  rates of change  with changing  carcass  weight or fatness.  
Conformation  class at the various  fat classes  is shown  in Table 11. This can in turn be 
related  to the weight  and kill-out  data in Tables  9 and 10. Conformation  improves  with 
increasing  weight  but as with kill-out  the relationship  is not linear. Most breed  types  fall 
into one of two conformation  classes  so once carcasses  reach the higher  of their two 
classes  no amount  of additional  weight  gain will bring about further  improvement  in 
conformation.  For example,  Friesians  are predominantly  O conformation  and some  can 
reach R if they are heavy  and well finished  but they can never  become  U. Similarly, 
continental  sucklers  are generally  R when light and U when heavier  but they rarely
17
become  E no matter  what  weight  they are taken  to. On average,  conformation  improves  
by one class per 160, 200, 190 and 180 kg increase  in slaughter  weight  for the breed 
types  as listed above.
Conclusions
For the foreseeable  future  animals  over 30 months  of age are unlikely  to be considered  
prime beef and this will be reflected  in price. All breed types available  can be 
satisfactorily  finished  at less than 30 months  (steers  and heifers)  and yield carcasses  of 
acceptable  weight  and grades. Irrespective  of breed type or source  (dairy or suckler  
herds),  animals  born before March are probably  best finished  indoors  at about 24 
months  of age (steers)  or 21 months  (heifers).  Animals  born later in spring can be 
finished  at pasture  and slaughtered  at 27-28  months  of age.
Where  purchased  animals  are below their target weight  for age they may express  
compensatory  growth  particularly  at pasture,  but the gap will not be entirely  closed  so 
they will either have to be fed better, retained  for longer or slaughtered  lighter.  
Considering  that so many carcasses  are overfat,  the latter option may be the most 
appropriate.  Where  there  is only a limited  time period  available  before  30 months,  rapid 
finishing  on a high concentrate  diet could be considered  provided  the liveweight  gain 
increment  required  is not more than about 150 kg. Slaughter  at a younger  age/lighter  
weight  will result in lower kill-out  and carcass  grade values. As slaughter  weight  
decreases,  kill-out,  carcass  fat class and carcass  conformation  class all decline  but the 
changes  are relatively  modest.
Due to the seasonal  pattern  of calving  (predominantly  spring),  there will be somewhat  
less finishing  off pasture  than heretofore.  However,  with good grassland  management  
in the calf and yearling  grazing  seasons,  there is no reason  why the total proportion  of 
gam from pasture  should  change.  Earlier  slaughter  at lighter  weight  would  generally  be 
beneficial  because  carcasses  would  be less fat.

The Irish beef industry  - an alternative  view
PHILIP  FARRELLY
Agricultural  Consultant,  Navan  Co. Meath
Introduction
Traditionally  a large proportion  of Irish beef has been disposed  of through  intervention  
or third country  markets,  rather  than marketed  on the lucrative  European  market. This 
has led to both the processors  and producers  receiving  prices below the European 
average.
The Beef Task Force  summarised  the conclusions  from a series  of studies  and made  
recommendations,  which in turn were accepted  in the Agri Food 2010 report. Funding 
for changes  has been committed  in the National  Development  Plan. However,  it can be 
argued  that the proposed  solutions  are based  on a flawed  analysis  of the problems  and 
if implemented,  whilst leading to improvements  at processing  level, will greatly 
accelerate  the decline  in farmer  numbers.
A solution  can only be found by adopting  a new paradigm  for the industry.  It must be 
accepted  that there are three phases  in the process. Production,  processing  & 
marketing.  Traditionally  slaughtering,  processing  and marketing  have been carried  out 
by the same people. This link must be broken. A new marketing  company  should  be 
formed,  preferably  owned  and funded  by farmers.  Farmers  would  then rear cattle and 
sell them at a pre-determined  and agreed  price to this company.  This company  would 
pay an agreed  fee to a processor  to slaughter  and process  the animals  to the required  
standards.  The marketing  company  would then market Irish beef in the affluent 
European  market  and distribute  the profits  to its shareholders.
This path would require  a paradigm  change  for all involved  in the industry.  We would  
need to see the industry  as an opportunity  and as a challenge  rather  than a crisis. The 
potential  rewards  are large. Achieving  European  prices  would  earn the industry  an extra  
£400 million  at 1999 prices.
Mention  beef and the word crises springs  to mind. It is not just farmers  who have 
problems,  all the stake holders  in the beef industry,  the farmers,  the processors,  the 
butchers,  the retailers,  the consumers  indeed  the Government,  all at the moment  look 
in despair  at the beef industry  and wonder  where  the future lies. From a farmer ’s 
perspective  the story gets worse  and worse. Relative  to the community  and indeed  to 
other farmers,  beef farmers  have been getting  poorer  and poorer. The point has now 
been reached  where  only a handful  of full-time  beef farmers  remain  in business.
The processing  side of the business  is also in crisis. Recent  reports  have drawn  
attention  to the fact that meat processors  operate  a very low profit margin  relative  to 
other industries.  Virtually  no re-investment  has occurred  in the meat processing 
business  in recent  years. Given  the low rate of re-investment  in the industry  there are 
real concerns  as to whether  Ireland  could supply  the sophisticated  European  markets  
even if we could access  them. The butchering  business  is also in decline  with the 
number  of retail butchers  falling  on a yearly  basis. If butchering  was even moderately 
profitable  this would  not be the case
22
The large multiple  supermarket  chains  which retail the majority  of beef nowadays  
complain  that their meat business  is low margin  and difficult. Consumers,  for so long 
secure  and content  with the meat they ate, are now racked  with doubts  on safety  and 
health grounds. These doubts are almost incapable  of explanation  on a rational  
examination.
Governments  at national  and EU level are becoming  increasingly  frustrated.  After  
decades  of pouring  money  into market  support  systems  they now find the market  still in 
total chaos  with no end in sight to funding  requirements.  Worse  still the very stability  of 
Governments  is being threatened  by the BSE crisis with cabinet  ministers  losing their 
jobs as a result.
Looking  for an answer
Despite  its problems  the beef industry  is hugely  important.  Unfortunately,  each sector  
blames  the other for the problems.  Farmers  are accused  of being inefficient,  and 
careless  about  food safety  and failing  to respond  to market  demands.  Processors  have  
been accused  of operating  a cartel to keep prices  down and of failing to market  Irish 
beef adequately.  Retailers  are accused  of profiteering  and failing  to respond  to price  
changes  at farm gate. Consumers  are blamed  for their fickleness  and they in turn, 
blame  everybody  else on health  and safety  grounds.
Analysing  the Problem
There is no scarcity  of analysis  of the problem.  Research  and investigation  has been  
conducted  by:
The Food Industry  Development  group
The McKenzie  report
The report  of the Beef  Task Force
The report of the Independent  Group into Anti-Competitive  Practices  in the Irish 
Beef Industry  
Teagasc  
An Bord Bia
Each report  has accepted  and endorsed  the findings  of its predecessor  and in a sense  
they are summarised  in the report of the Beef Task Force. This report in turn gets 
approval  from the Agri Food 2010 document,  and there are commitments  to funding  
change  in the National  Development  Plan.
Recommendations
The recommendations  of the Beef  Task Force  are aspirational  and artificial.  They  do not 
deal in the real world. They try to accommodate  the interests  of all participants  when  
this is clearly impossible.  Suggestions  were put forward  for rationalisation  in the 
processing  sector, which would not be tolerated  in any other industry. Their  
recommendations  on marketing  are aspirational  and artificial  and again would not be 
tolerated  In any other  industry.
There  is pain to be suffered  but the Beef  Task Force  has attempted  to avoid  the pain.
23
Why the wrong  Recipe
The Beef Task Force accepted  the views of the McKenzie  Report, which was 
commissioned  by Enterprise  Ireland. However,  Enterprise  Ireland is charged  with 
increasing  employment  in indigenous  Irish industry,  therefore,  its principle  focus is on 
employment  in downstream  industries  rather  than on the interests  of beef retailers,  beef 
marketing  or the farmer ’s perspective.  It was no surprise  that the Beef Task Force 
accepted  the conclusions  of the Food Industry  Development  Group  since  the members  
of the Beef Task Force are almost identical  to the members  of the Food Industry 
Development  Group.
Similarly  the views  of Teagasc  and Bord Bia were  also accepted  by the Beef  Task Force, 
since both organisations  are represented  on the Task Force. From the moment  the 
Department  selected  the membership  of the Task Force the outcome  was inevitable.  
The group  comprised  members  of the Department  itself, which has presided  over the 
status  quo for years, and representatives  of the farm organisations,  which meant  that 
the report  could not come down heavily  against  the farmers  and had to placate  their 
representatives.  Representatives  of the meat processors  and the Irish meat  
association.  A committee  containing  five high ranking  meat  men could  not lay the blame  
at the door of the factories.  Add in a representative  from Enterprise  Ireland  and a 
representative  from SIPTU  and now you have the interests  of jobs and the workers  
protected.  Top off the committee  with a representative  from Bord Bia and you ensure  
the continuation  of the status quo in relation  to marketing  and promotion,  and the 
Teagasc representative  will ensure  that there  are platitudes  towards  increased  efficiency  
at farm level and the value  of the advisory  service.
As a result  of the make up of the committee  the end result  was inevitable,  the farmers  
could not be blamed,  the processors  could  not be blamed;  the Department  could  not be 
blamed;  Bord Bia could  not be blamed  and Teagasc  could  not be blamed.  However,  that 
wasn ’t the only weakness,  not only could nobody  be blamed  but nobody  could be given 
responsibility  to change  the situation.  Given  the committee  make  up the status  quo had 
to be protected.  So the Task Force  reached  a compromise  - we’ll do a little bit of this, 
we’ll do a little bit of that and then everything  should  be all right.
Flawed  Assumptions
At the heart of the analysis  of the problems  of the industry  there is a flawed  assumption  
that a single  solution  can solve  the problems  of all the participants  in the industry.  This 
is not the case. A solution  that will solve  the farmer ’s problems  may be ruinous  for the 
processors.  What  will solve  the problem  for the processors  may eliminate  the majority  
of the farmers. For example,  if farmers  were to export  their weanlings  their business  
might become  very profitable,  but this would have disastrous  consequences  for the 
processors.
Where  are the solutions?
If we want  to maintain  the industry  in anything  like its present  shape,  then it is necessary  
to develop  markets  for Irish beef. This will not be done under  the present  regime  were  
traditionally  beef processors  have also been the beef marketers.  In this role they have
24
failed totally. Yes, some European  markets  have been developed,  but for decades  the 
easy option of either intervention  or latterly  subsided  third country  markets  has been 
relied upon. Inten/ention  is now gone and the writing  is on the wall for the third country  
markets. We must develop  a new paradigm  for the industry. To do this requires  
separation  of the three  distinct  processes.
Production
Slaughtering  & Processing  
Marketing
Production  - this is a relatively  efficient  sector,  which  is adaptable,  but can be improved^ 
Beef can be produced  at a profit, at a price ranging  between  85-90p per pound  
depending  on the season.
Slaughtering  & Processing  - whilst  the slaughtering  and processing  industry  is capable  
of handling  the entire production  from Irish farms,  it is in need of rationalisation.  The 
industry  has a skilled  labour  force,  storage,  transport,  chilling  and freezing  facilities,  and 
has a well-established  distribution  network. With rationalisation  and re-organisation  
there is no reason  why the slaughtering  and processing  industry  in Ireland  couldn  t be 
developed  to be the most efficient  in Europe.
Marketing  - It is at marketing  that the weakness  exists  in the Irish beef industry,  and it 
is at marketing  that we will continue  to fail until we break  the link between  marketing  an 
processing.  Marketing  must be established  as an independent  link in the chain. One 
model  of this already  exists  in the Irish Dairy Board. In the past the size of a processors  
slaughtering  capacity  was the size of his marketing  responsibilities.  All of the reports  
identify  the lack of commitment  to long-term  marketing  and opportunism  among  the 
meat groups together  with cut-throat  competition  and rivalry  as being major  problerns  
in the past. These  problems  will not go away. The structure  of the industry  with the 
processors  having  to compete  against  each other for raw material  and again compete  
in the markets  means that no one processor  could possibly  afford to invest the 
resources  necessary  to develop  long term markets.  It is not that the markets  are not 
there it is simply  that the investment  has not been made  to develop  them. If any other  
industry  sector behaved  in a similar  fashion  to the beef processing  sector,  they too 
would have similar  problems.  The drinks  industry  and the motor industry  for examp  e 
have fierce competition  for market  share but yet the manufacturers  strictly  adhere  to 
codes  of conduct  on pricing  and pricing  agreements.
A marketing  company  could be very profitable  and could achieve  increased  prices  at 
wholesale  and therefore  at producer  level.
The chain will then have three  distinct  links;
Production
Slaughtering  & Processing  
Marketing
Are we Winners  or Losers?
From a positive  perspective  there is a tremendous  opportunity  awaiting  the Irish beef 
industry.  To avail of this opportunity  does not require  that we re-invent  the wheel  or sel
25
something  to the Europeans  that they don’t like. Nothing  is being asked that hasn ’t 
been done before. What  is required  is that we sell more Irish beef. In 1995 (before  the 
BSE crisis)  we sold 70% of our beef in Europe,  by 1999 this had reclined  to 50%, but 
this reduction  is against  a backdrop  of alternative  easy third country  markets  being  
available.  There  is no choice. If we don’t sell beef in Europe  then we will not sell beef.  
The question  really is, will we sell beef better  through  a single  agency  or do we leave  it 
is the disjointed  failed methods  of the past?
Paths  to achievement
What is required  is the establishment  of a marketing  company  preferably  funded  by 
farmers,  which  would  take responsibility  for marketing  Irish beef. This company  would  
commit  major  resources  to marketing  and promotional  effort. Bord Bia’s present  budget  
for its entire operation  is approximately  £20million.  It has responsibility  for the entire  
food industry  including  beverages,  pig meat,  sheep  meat  and prepared  meals  along  with 
beef. Out of this budget  it is hard to imagine  its marketing  spend on beef could be 
greater  than £5million.  This is spread  over the Irish and European  market.  If 7% of the 
wholesale  value  of Irish beef  were allocated  to marketing  this would  deliver  a budget  of 
£140million  or a thirty-fold  increase  in marketing  effort.
The steps
• Unity of purpose  among  farm organisations  and a commitment  from farmers  to make 
a large equity  investment  in their own futures.
• Commitment  of the Department  of Agriculture  in terms of equity, investment  and 
annual  support.
• Share capital launch  to secure  a sound capital base (an average  investment  of 
£1,000  per farmer  involved  in the cattle  industry  would  yield £130,000,000).
• Recruit  top class management  and engage  the services  of Europe ’s brightest  
promotional  and marketing  expertise.
• Co-operate  with Department  of Agriculture  and other  agencies  in enforcing  the most 
rigorous  quality  and safety  standards  at all stages  in the supply  chain.
• Commit  a minimum  of 7% of wholesale  sales  to the marketing  effort (£140million  in 
1999 terms).

Relationships  between  milk production,  grass  dry matter  
intake  and grass  digestion
JEAN LOUIS  PEYRAUD,  REMI DEU\GARDE,  LUC DELABY  
Joint Research  Unit INRA-ENSAR  on Dairy Production,
Domaine  de la prise, 35590  St Gilles,  France
Introduction
With the advent  of milk quotas,  the necessity  to take account  of environmental  concerns  
and current  changes  in agricultural  policy (GATT  proposals),  limitations  have been 
imposed  on intensive  production  systems.  Further  changes  will continue  to reduce  the 
level of protection  enjoyed  by EU countries,  and will reinforce  environmental  constraints.  
In the future, utilisation  of grass by grazing  will form the basis of sustainable  dairying  
systems,  especially  in western  Europe  where grass grows regularly  from spring to 
autumn. Grazing  is the cheapest  source  of nutrition  for dairy cows, thus allowing  an 
increased  efficiency  per litre of milk. Grazing  also contributes  to preservation  of the rural 
landscape  and gives a good image  of dairy products.
Full exploitation  of the grazed grass requires  the development  of grazing  systems  
designed  to maximise  daily herbage  intake per cow and to improve  the efficiency  of 
nutrient  use through  the provision  of supplementary  feeds. Since  the original  work of 
Mott (1960), a large number  of studies have highlighted  the effect of grazing  
management  and amount  of supplementary  feeds upon performances  per animal  and 
per unit area. However,  most of these studies  have been based  on systems  designed  
to achieve  maximum  milk yield per unit area, accompanied  by increased  use of energy  
concentrates.  The challenge  is now to reduce  inputs by examining  opportunities  to 
improve  grass intake  per cow while maintaining  high quality  swards  over the grazing  
season. To achieve  this objective,  we need to describe  the input/output  response  
curves  that should  be used to evaluate  the optimal  supply  according  to the current  price. 
Milk production  is largely  dependent  upon the factors  controlling  herbage  intake  and 
ruminant  digestion.  The factors  involved  include  animal  characteristics  themselves,  and 
the nutritive  value and physical  characteristics  of the swards. In practice,  grazing  
management  and grass  production  techniques  can manipulate  these  latter  two factors.  
The aim of this paper is to review  recent  advances  on the effect of these sources  of 
variations,  with particular  emphasis  on opportunities  to increase  grass intake  per cow, 
grazing  good quality  pastures  and to describe  the response  curves.
Animal  factors  affecting  intake  and production  at grazing  without  supplements
Delaby  et al., (1999a  and 2001) have examined  the performances  of unsupplemented  
grazing  cows (Figure  1) over 187 lactations.  They showed  that actual  milk yield (aMY)  
in spring  grazing  cows (April to early July) averages  22.2 kg when no concentrate  was 
delivered,  but there  were large differences  between  cows,  the range  being 10 kg within  
primiparous  and 17 kg within multiparous  cows. The cow potential  primarily  affects  
these differences.  The authors  propose  estimating  cow potential  using the concept  of 
expected  milk yield (eMY). The eMY parameter  is calculated  as the reference  milk yield 
at turnout  (early April) when cows were fed ad libitum  with maize silage and grass.
27
corrected  for the length  of the experiment  assuming  a weekly  persistency  of 0.98. The 
relationship  between  aMY and eMY is linear;
aMY = 0.25 DHA+  0.65 eMY + D; n=187;  rsd = 1.71; r = = 0.83 (equation  1) 
where  DHA is daily herbage  allowance  at 5 cm above  ground  level in kg DM cow-i d-i 
and D = +1.3 for multiparous  and +0.6 for primiparous  cows. This relationship  shows  
that beyond  15 kg of milk, cows  are able to produce  0.65 of each kg of expected  milk in 
addition  above  15 kg. This means  that a cow producing  40 kg of milk at turnout  (i.e. 35 
kg eMY during  12 spring  weeks)  is able to produce  around  28 kg with no supplements  
at spring  grazing  and illustrates  the potential  to achieve  quite high performance  levels  
at pasture  although  there is not a full exploitation  of the genetic  merit. However  the 
difference  between  the expected  and actual  milk yield reflects  the shortfall  between  the 
theoretical  requirements  of the cows and the energy  inputs  allowed  by herbage  alone. 
This shortfall  increases  from 4 kg in cows  with 25 kg of expected  milk to 9 kg in cows 
with 45 kg of expected  milk. Kolver  and Muller  (1997)  have also pointed  out a major  
reduction  in milk yield in cows  with high potential  that were fed with grass  only.
Figure  1: Milk yield at grazing  without  supplementation  in relation  to milk potential
(after  Delaby  et al., 1999)
Daily Herbage  DM intake  (DHI) averages  11 kg for dry cows (Delagarde  and Peyraud,  
unpublished),  which  is higher  than the maintenance  requirement.  DHI is 3 to 5 kg higher  
in milking  cows than in dry cows (Hodgson  and Jamieson,  1981; Gibb et at., 1999,  
Delagarde  et al., unpublished).  High yielding  cows  have  a greater  nutrient  demand,  and 
this is reflected  in increased  grass intake,  with incremental  increases  in DHI averaging  
260 g DM kg eMY-i (Caird  and Holmes,  1986; Peyraud  et al., 1996 b, Christie  et al.. 
2000; Delagarde  et al.. 2000). This additional  increase  in intake  represents  about  two 
thirds of the net energy  (NE) requirement  for 1 kg of fat-corrected  milk when the 
digestibility  of the grass is higher  than 0.75. This is in reasonable  agreement  with the 
observed  milk responses  in Figure  1. Levels  of intake  up to 20 kg DM day L which 
allows  a production  of 30 - 32 kg milk, can be reached  during  a few weeks  in the spring 
when both the digestibility  of sward and herbage  allowance  are high. The partial
28
regression  coefficient  between  herbage  intake  and milk yield is higher  (400 to 500 g kg- 
1 milk) when experimental  milk yield was used (Stakelum  and Connelly,  1987; Butler  et 
al., submitted;  Peyraud,  unpublished)  reflecting  herbage  intake limits to milk yield at 
grazing.
Grazing  time increases  between  dry and lactating  cows from 5 to 8 min kg milk h 
(Brumby,  1959; Journet  and Demarquilly,  1979; Delagarde  and Peyraud,  unpublished).  
However  within lactating  cows rotationally  grazed,  increases  in herbage  intake are 
mostly  mediated  through  higher  rates of intake,  grazing  time tending  to reach  a plateau  
at 10 h d-i (Rook and Huckle,  1996; Delagarde,  1997; O’Connell  et at., 2000). This 
clearly  indicates  that high-producing  animals  are able to express  a higher  motivation  
and a more aggressive  appetite  at grazing.  This also points  out the necessity  to offer  
easily harvestable  grass. Whether  higher intake rate is due to a faster biting rate 
(O’Connell  et al., 2000) or to a larger intake per bite as suggested  by the studies  of 
Fuerst-Waltl  et al., (1997)  and Butler  et al., (submitted)  remains  unclear.
The eMY parameter  depends  on the genetic  merit of the cow and the number  of days  
in milk. DHI appears  to be mainly governed  by the peak of milk production  with 
incremental  increases  averaging  180 g DM/kg  milk at the peak (Peyraud  et al., 1998; 
Delagarde  et al., 2000) but DHI is poorly related  to the stage of lactation  after the 
second  month  of lactation  (Caird  and Holmes,  1986; Peyraud  et al., 1998; Delagarde  et 
al., 2000). With first lactating  cows, Butler et al., (in press) reported  a significant  
increase  of grass  intake  with the number  of days in lactation  (20 g DM day-i). For spring  
calving  cows, herbage  intake  increases  from about  12 kg DM at 10 days of lactation  to 
16 kg at the end of the first month  (Peyraud,  unpublished),  which  is not sufficient  to meet  
energy  and protein  requirements.  Moreover  the animal ’s capacity  to increase  intake  at 
the beginning  of the lactation  appears  to be largely  influenced  by the sward  conditions.  
DHI increases  by 1.0 to 1.5 kg DM 100 kg-r of body live weight  (Peyraud  et al., 1996 b 
and unpublished),  which is similar to the incremental  increase  reported  for cattle  
differing  in size (Zoby  and Holmes,  1983). This is mediated  by an increase  in the rate 
of intake  of 3 g DM min-^ per 100 kg LW whereas  grazing  time decreases  (- 40 min per 
100 kg LW, Delagarde,  1997) as the size of the animal  increases.  This also appears  to 
be the case between  growing  cattle differing  in age and live weight  when the grazing  
time decreases  by 30 min per 100 kg LW (Zoby  and Holmes,  1983). Intake  is decreased  
by 2.5 kg OM dayi in Normand  cows compared  with Holstein  cows. The difference  is 
mainly  explained  by the difference  in milk yield (Delaby  et al., 1999b)  and it does not 
appear  to be a breed  effect  per se.
Sward  factors  affecting  intake  and milk production  at grazing
It has been recognized  for a long time that herbage  digestibility  is an indirect  predictor  
of the main characteristics  of plant  material  that determine  filling  effect  in the rumen  (e g. 
rate of digestion,  rate of passage)  and thus partly  determines  voluntary  dry matter  intake  
(VDMI in kg day-’) in housed  animal  (Demarquilly  and Jarrige,  1971). At grazing  the 
situation  is more  complex.  Changes  in sward  digestibility  are most  often associated  with  
several  sward  structural  changes  such as mass and height,  content  and distribution  of 
the different  morphological  components  within the canopy. The effect of grass  
digestibility  and quantity  of easily  harvestable  material  are operating  in the same  time in
29
controlling  DHI. This lead to difficulties  in quantifying  the relative  effect  of the physical  
constraints  to prehending  grass,  and rumen  fill in controlling  herbage  intake. Moreover  
grazing  cattle  generally  select  a diet of higher  digestibility  than the total available  sward.
Nutritional  factors
In housed  animal,  provided  grass is delivered  in a vegetative  stage VDMI of the main 
grass  species  does not vary to any large extent  (Table  1). At equal digestibility,  VDMI  
of legumes  is 5 to 10 % greater  than that of grasses  (INRA  1989). Prior  to entering  the 
reproductive  stage  VDMI  declines  only slightly  (0.15  to 0.20 kg dayi per week)  with the 
age of regrowth  (due to the ratio between  green leaves and stem not changing  
significantly.  However,  the rate of decline  increases  significantly  after the beginning  of 
the heading  stage. Between  early heading  and end of flowering  VDMI  declines  by 0.17 
kg day-1 per unit of digestibility.  The rate of decline  is faster for Cocksfoot  and 
Bromegrass  than for perennial  ryegrass  and fescue.  The effect  of digestibility  is less for 
legumes  than for pure grasses.

At grazing,  Curran  and Holmes  (1970)  failed  to show  from multiple  regression  analysis  
a significant  effect  of digestibility  on DHI in dairy cows (d > 0.75). However  Peyraud  et 
al., (1996b)  and Ferrer-Cazcarra  (1995) have reported  a small positive  effect with 
incremental  increase  of DHI ranging  from 0.1 - 0.2 kg per unit increase  in pepsine-  
cellulase  digestibility.  In Ireland,  a set of experiments  has shown  large effects  of sward  
digestibility  upon DHI (-0.5 kg DM per unit digestibility)  and milk production  in summer  
(Stakelum  and O’Donnovan,  1998). However,  in these trials changes  in digestibility  
were probably  associated  with large modifications  of the sward  structure  as the different  
levels  of digestibility  were created  by different  grazing  pressure  in early spring.
Direct  comparisons  of grazed  grass species  have been extremely  rare in dairy cows.  
The original  work of Demarquilly  (1963) showed  that there were some reproducible
30
variations  in milk yield when cows grazed  different  grass and legumes  species. The 
comparisons  generally  confirmed  data obtained  from indoor experiments,  although  
differencees  were sometimes  larger  (cumulative  effects  of digestibility  and structure?),  
Greenhaigh  and Reid (1969)  reported  that DHI and milk yield were both reduced  by 1 
to 2 kg dayi when cows were grazed  on cocksfoot  rather  than on perennial  ryegrass  
swards. As a consequence,  an extra 2 kg of concentrate  must be provided  to maintain  
milk yield on cocksfoot  plots (Hoden  and Peyraud,  unpublished).  Herbage  intake  by 
sheep are higher on monocultures  of legumes  than on grasses  (Orr et al., 1995). 
Delagarde  et at., (unpublished)  have recently  observed  higher DHI on a mixed  
ryegrass/white  clover  sward  compared  with a pure grass sward (13.3 vs 11.4 kg DM 
day') while the pepsine-cellulase  digestibility  was lower on ryegrass  (0.75 vs 0.72). 
Several studies have shown that milk production  is higher within a mixed sward  
compared  with pure perennial  ryegrass  (Murdock  et al., 1960; Thomson  et al., 1985;  
Wilkins  et al., 1994 and 1995),  the differences  increasing  with the clover  content.  The 
mixed ryegrass/white  clover  swards  should  be seriously  considered  as an alternative  
option  to pure grasses  swards  with the expected  reduction  in the use of N fertiliser.
DHI of grazed  ryegrass  falls by 2.2 kg day'  between  the vegetative  and the reproductive  
stage (Greenhaigh  et al., 1966). Age of regrowth  is also reported  to effect DHI in 
vegetative  swards. Parga et al., (unpublished)  have shown  a 1.5 kg DM fall in DHI 
between  20 and 40 days of regrowth.  The detrimental  effect of age of regrowth  on 
intake  is worsened  in terms  of inputs  of nutrients  by the reduction  of the nutritive  value  
of grasses  (INRA, 1989). Between  28 and 50 days, digestibility  (0.80 to 0,75) and 
content  of protein  flowing  into the duodenum  (154 to 110 g kg DM ') decrease  for 
perennial  ryegrass  whereas  they remain  practically  unchanged  for white clover  (0.80  
and 180 g kg DM ') (Peyraud,  1993; Mambrini  and Peyraud,  1994). Again, mixed  
swards  appear to  be an interesting  alternative  option  allowing  more  flexibility  in grazing  
management.
The DM content  of herbage  can affect herbage  intake. Studies  with housed  cows  
showed  that low DM content  reduces  herbage  intake  at a rate of 1 kg per 40 g kg ' fall 
in DM content  below a critical  value of 180 g kg ' (Verite  and Journet,  1970). The 
mechanism  is not yet completely  understood.  In recent  studies  conducted  in Rennes  
(Cabrera  et al., unpublished)  increasing  DM content  from 19 to 26 % by a soft drying  of 
fresh grass  increased  DM intake  from 17.9 to 18.9 kg day' whereas  diluting  DM content  
by soaking  fresh grass into a water bath did not decrease  herbage  DM intake  
irespective  of whether  the grass  was previously  dried  or not. This suggests  that internal  
water is more important  than external  water  in regulating  intake. High rainfall  has also 
been shown  to adversely  affect  intake  by cattle  (Butris  and Phillips,  1987). Besides  the 
effect of internal  water content,  the herbage  surface  water and/or  soil contamination  
might also reduce  the palatability  of the herbage  at grazing.
A shortage  of protein  is unlikely  to arrive when cows are grazing  good quality  grass,  
since pasture  has a high crude protein  content. However,  a shortage  of protein  may 
arise when the level of N fertilisation  is reduced,  when stage of maturity  increases  or 
during dry summers.  Reduction  in protein  content  below 12 % DM has led to a fall in 
herbage  intake (2 kg DM day', Delagarde  et al., 1997). Reduced  herbage  intake is 
mostly  mediated  through  a shortage  of degradable  protein  and/or  metabolisable  protein  
since feeding  supplement  rich in protected  protein  increases  grass intake up to the
31
control  level (Delagarde  et al., 1997 and 1999).

Grass  availability
The three main factors  affecting  DHI at grazing  are the intake  capacity  of the animal,  the 
VDMI of the forage and the physical  characteristics  of the sward canopy  which  
determines  the quantity  of harvestable  material. Wade (1991) defines herbage  
availability  as the relative  ease or difficulty  with which  herbage  can be harvested  by the 
grazing  animal. The availability  of grass is a complex  parameter,  which  takes  account  
of qualitative  and quantitative  aspects  of the sward,  the nutritive  value  of the grass  and 
the intake capacity  and size of the animal,  and the area allocated  by the farmer. 
Numerous  studies  have focused  upon the relationships  between  sward structure  and 
intake per bite assuming  an overriding  importance  of intake per bite in driving  daily 
herbage  intake.  However,  there is surprisingly  little data to quantify  the effect  of sward 
structural  characteristics  known  to influence  the bite weight  upon daily intake.
Under  a continuous  stocking  situation,  the area offered  to cows is large,  sward  height  is 
constant,  then herbage  availability  is a direct  function  of the sward  state. DHI increases  
asymptotically  with sward mass and/or  sward height (SH) (Le Du 1980). From a 
comprehensive  review, Delagarde  et al., (2001, Figure 2) have obtained  the 
relationship:
DHI = 12.1 (1 - e-0 34SH)
This shows  maximum  intake  for SH averaging  9-10  cm, and DHI decreasing  rapidly  for 
SH below 7 cm. These data were obtained  with low producing  animals  and the 
threshold  height  to reach  the plateau  might  be higher  for high producing  cows. Intake 
per bite and rate of intake  are positively  related  to sward  height. Animals  increase  their 
grazing  time as a compensating  response  to a decline  in the rate of intake, but 
compensation  is seldom  adequate  to prevent  a fall in daily intake  on particularly  short  
swards  (Hodgson,  1986).
Figure  2. Influence  of sward  height  on DHI in set stocked  dairy cows  
(Delagarde  et al., 2001).
32
Under  rotational  grazing  the area offered  to the cow is limited  and the animals  are forced  
to graze into deeper  layers  of the sward,  which  results  in a more complete  depletion  of 
the canopy. The process  takes place in one day when fresh pasture  is allocated  daily  
(strip grazing)  or during several  days when a paddock  is offered  for several  days  
(simplified  rotational  grazing)  but the concept  is the same. Herbage  availability  is firstly  
defined in term of daily herbage  allowance  (DHA). DHA is defined  as the weight  of 
herbage  cut above  a sampling  height  and allowed  per cow per day (Greenhaigh  et al., 
1966). It is important  to bear in mind that DHA  is a combination  of the amount  of grass  
per ha and the offered  area, which  is allocated  by the farmer  (either  as an area offered  
each day or a residency  time in a paddock).  DHA is more often estimated  at ground  
level or at a cutting  height  of 4 to 5 cm assuming  that the material  below  that height  is 
not available  for the animal. A number  of studies have demonstrated  a strong  
curvilinear  relationship  between  DHA  and DHI (Greenhaigh  et at., 1966; Combellas  and 
Hodgson,  1979; Peyraud  et al., 1996b). From a comprehensive  review  of the literature  
Delagarde  et al., (2001,  Figure  3) have obtained  the following  relationship:-
DHI = 18.4 (1- e
Figure  3>DHA); n = 92; r= = 0.87; rsd = 0,99 (equation  2).

According  to the relationships,  DHI reaches  a plateau  corresponding  to the intake  
capacity  of the cow for high DHA, which  also corresponds  to an inefficient  utilisation  of 
the sward  and high post-grazing  sward  height. Conversely  for DHA  ranging  between  30 
to 40 kg DM (corresponding  to normal  grazing  practices)  the cows do not satisfy  their 
appetite  (DHI = 80% of the intake capacity).  This explains  why the response  to 
supplementary  concentrate  can be high for high producing  cows  at grazing  (see below).  
When considering  DHA above 5 cm, Peyraud  et al., (1996) observed  that with 
vegetative  perennial  ryegrass  swards,  an average  increase  in DHI of 0.27 kg DM per kg 
increase  in DHA when DHA ranges  between  12 to 17 kg dayT and a much smaller  
increase  (+ 0.05 kg DM day^)  as DHA increases  above  20 kg dayT Milk yield increases  
by 0.25 kg dayi per kg increase  in herbage  allowance  over the same  range  of variation  
(see equation  1).
33
The response  of DHI to DHA  will depend  on the cow requirement.  When  DHA  increased  
from 12 to 18 kg, DHI did not vary for dry cows but increases  (+ 2 kg) for high yielding  
cows (Delagarde  and Peyraud,  unpublished).  Recent  studies  conducted  at Moorepark  
with first lactating  cows (Stakelum  and O’Donovan,  2000) clearly  show high genetic  
merit cows require  higher  DHA than low genetic  merit cows. For a given allowance,  
grass  availability  might  also be altered  by the structure  of the sward. This firstly  raises  
the question  of the effect of pre-grazing  sward height/mass  on intake. However,  
because  the animals  are forced  to graze  in the deep horizons,  herbage  intake  might  not 
be directly  related  to pre-grazing  sward  height/mass  as it was described  in continuous  
stocking  (Figure  4). Stakelum  (1986a)  observed  that DHI increased  when herbage  
mass increased  from 2.8 and 3.5 t DM ha-T Conversely,  for higher  levels  of herbage  
mass,  Parga  ef a/., (unpublished)  have reported  a linear  decrease  in DHI (-0.8 kg t-i DM 
ha-i) when cows grazed  more mature  vegetative  regrowths  (similar  digestibility  0.77) 
between  4.3 and 6.1 t DM ha f Combellas  and Hodgson  (1979)  also found a slight  
decrease  in herbage  intake between  4.3 and 5.0 t DM ha T Therefore,  DHI may 
increase  with increasing  pre-grazing  sward  height/mass,  reflecting  a more favourable  
spatial  distribution  of the herbage  in relation  to ease of prehension  as it is described  in 
continuous  stocking.  On tall swards,  other limiting  factors  may have a negative  effect  
on daily intake. On a normal  range  of DHA, there might be an optimal  range of pre­
grazing  sward  height  between  10 to 14 cm (rising  plate meter).

On rotational  grazing,  because  sward height will decline  during the grazing  down  
process  as a function  of DHA, the herbage  availability  is mostly  determined  by plant 
structure  at the base of the sward,  when  the animal  ceases  to eat. In vegetative  swards,  
the grass  leaf consists  of free leaf blade  in the upper  part of the sward  and a leaf sheath  
at the bottom  of the sward  (pseudostem).  Wade  et al., (1989  and 1995)  first concluded 
that herbage  availability  varied  not only with herbage  height  but also with the height  of 
free leaf blades  upon the pseudostem.  This was based on the study of the grazing  
down process  in rotationally  grazed  paddocks  (Table  2). The swards  were initially  tall 
in three paddocks  and small in three other paddocks.  Intake and milk yield started
34
falling  when grazing  reached  higher  heights  in initially  tall swards  than in initially  small  
swards,  but milk yield and intake started  to decline  when the free leaf lamina  was 
approximately  55 mm for the two types  of swards.

The positive  effect of a high proportion  of free leaf blades  in deep layers  was further  
demonstrated  by Parga  et al., (2000). These  authors  prepared  two contrasting  swards  
by different  cutting  regime  before  measurements.  The swards  differed  by the proportion  
of green leaf blades  below  15 cm (namely  39 versus  49%) but had the same  amount  of 
leaf blades  above  15 cm and similar  pre-grazing  height  (12.5 cm). At high DHA, DHI 
was similar  in both swards,  but when DHA decreased  from 18 to 13 kg DM, DHI was 
less affected on leafy than on control swards. From a compilation  of several  
experiments  (Figure  4) it is clear that the allowance  of free leaf blades  is a better  
predictor  of DHI than DHA thus confirming  that pseudostems  may act as a barrier  to 
controlling  intake. Increasing  leaf blade  mass  at the bottom  of the sward  by appropriate  
grazing  management  or varietal  selection  may play a major  role in increasing  herbage  
intake  while maintaining  a low residual  sward  height.
In practice,  these  results  suggest  that DHI is not precisely  related  to post-grazing  sward  
height (generally  measured  with a plate meter)  when changes  in sward  structure  were  
imposed.  This was investigated  at Rennes  with 6 grazing  experiments  where  different  
sward structures  were compared  at two levels  of DHA (Delagarde  and Peyraud,  2001).  
Post-grazing  sward height  increased  with DHA, but for a given DHA, it was positively  
related to the pre-grazing  sward height. Variations  in DHI were predicted  more  
accurately  from the height  of the residual  free leaf blade upon pseudostem  (Figure  5) 
than from post-grazing  sward  height. DHI decreases  rapidly  when  height  of the free leaf 
blades  is below  4 cm in spite  of possible  variations  in the post-grazing  sward  height. For 
example  DHI can be dramatically  reduced  with a post-grazing  height  higher  than 8 cm 
when cows graze  plots with long pre-grazing  pseudostem.  This may occur  on regrowths  
following  a lax grazing  in the previous  rotation  or with early heading  varieties  grazed  in 
late spring.

Changing  the proportion  of leaf blade to pseudostem  also affects the ruminal  
fermentation  pattern,  as leaf blades  are highly  fermentable.  Parga et al., (2000)  and 
Delagarde  et at., (unpublished)  have observed  a lower pH (6.2 vs 6.0), a lower  
proportion  of acetate  (58.9  vs 62.3) and a higher  proportion  of propionate  (23.1 vs 21.4) 
in the rumen  of cows having  access  to leafy swards  (42 vs 35 % leaf blades).  This has 
led to a lower fat content  in milk (36.6 vs 37.9 g kg '). The allowed  quantity  of leaf 
bladesdirectly  affects  ruminal  pH and the ruminal  fermentation  pattern  as shown in 
Figure  6, which  summarises  3 trials in which  allowance  of leaf blades  was controlled  by 
manipulating  the morphological  composition  of the sward and DHA; the higher  the 
allowance  the lower  ruminal  pH, and the acetate  to propionate  ratio.

Figure  7 outlines  the relationship  between  DHI response  and milk response  when DHI 
varies with grass availability.  The data are taken from the set of 6 experiments
36
conducted  at Rennes.  It is clear  that responses  of DHI and milk yield are closely  related  
with each variation  of 1 kg of DHI resulting  in a 1 kg variation  in milk yield. This slope  
is in good agreement  with the marginal  response  of milk yield to variation  in energy  
intake for cows that are fed slightly  under requirement  (INRA  1989). The figure also 
show that grazing  management  which results  in different  DHI will lead directly  to an 
increase  in animal  performance.  A short-term  effect  of 2 to 3 kg of milk can be expected.

by the availability  of grass.
The objective  of grazing  is to control  the cumulative  effects  of the practices  of grazing  
management  on the sward  structure  over successive  rotations.  It has been shown  that 
large increases  in DHA in early season  will result in a deterioration  of sward  quality  in 
mid and late season. Mayne  et al., (1988);  Hoogendoorn  et al., (1992);  Fisher  et al., 
1995, and Stakelum  and O’Donovan  (1998)  have shown  an increase  in the proportion  
of stem  and dead material,  and a sharp  reduction  in herbage  digestibility,  DHI and milk 
yield in subsequent  grazing  rotations  following  lax grazing  in early season. From a 
practical  point of view, the room for manoeuvre  is not very large. Hoden  et al., (1991)  
and Delaby  et al., (1999b)  found  that DHI can be increased  by 1.5 kg DM cow-^ per day 
when increasing  post-grazing  sward  height  by 1 cm in spring  without  noticeable  effects  
on sward quality  late in the season. Beyond  these  values,  alternative  strategies  must  
be adopted  to utilise residual  herbage  to a degree  commensurate  with maintaining  
sustainable  high quality  swards  over the grazing  season.  One possible  alternative  is to 
prepare  leafy swards  by grazing  very early in spring  with a group  of heifers  or sheep.
Supplementation  at grazing
Offering  concentrate  feed has the objective  of increasing  total energy  intake  and animal  
performances  but the extent  of the responses  will depend  to what  extent  supplementary  
feeds affects herbage  intake. When good responses  were obtained,  feeding  
concentrates  is a powerful  tool for controlling  animal  performance  while  ensuring  a good  
grazing  management.

Intake  and Milk response  to incremental  amounts  of supplements
Following  the reviews  of Journet  and Demarquilly  (1979);  Leaver  et al.. (1985) and 
Mayne (1991), it was generally  accepted  that concentrates  were not used very 
efficiently  by grazing  dairy cows;  average  responses  were  0.4 to 0.6 kg milk per kg (DM)  
from concentrate,  mainly because  feeding concentrate  generally  reduces  DHI. 
Substitution  rate (kg reduction  in DHI per kg increase  in concentrate  DM intake)  
averaged  0.5 to 0.6. From two comprehensive  reviews  of the literature  it has recently 
been shown  that the efficiency  of supplementation  (0.6 ± 0.5, n = 141; Delaby  and 
Peyraud,  unpublished)  and substitution  rate (0.4 ± 0.3; n = 57; Delagarde  and Peyraud, 
unpublished)  are quite variable,  indicating  high responses  can be achieved  in some  
circumstances.  Indeed,  overall  efficiencies  close  to, or higher  than 1.0 kg of milk per kg 
DM concentrate  were recently  reported  when low or moderate  amounts  of concentrate  
are provided  to cows producing  more  than 25 kg milk at turnout  (Table  3). It is probable 
these  higher  responses  are related  to the genetic  merit of the cow which  has increased 
appreciably  since the earlier reviews,  whereas  DHA was not increased  in order to 
control  the level of post-grazing  sward  height.
Milk response  to concentrate  tends  to decrease  with increasing  concentrate  allowance  
(Table  3), but this effect seems  to be moderate,  providing  concentrate  allowance  does  
not exceed  6 kg day-L The marginal  efficiency  (from which depends  the economic  
returns)  slightly  decreases  when sward limitations  are minimised  and/or  with cows of 
moderate  genetic  merit. Delaby  et at., (2001)  reported  that marginal  efficiency  hardly 
decreased  between  4 to 6 kg concentrate  in slightly  restricted  grazing  conditions  with 
cows producing  30 kg of milk at turnout. A marginal  efficiency  greater  than 0.6 was 
recently  reported  between  5 and 10 kg of concentrate  for cows producing  more  than 35 
kg milk at turnout  (Sayers  et at.. 2000). In the range  of 2 to 6 kg dayL the amount  of 
concentrate  has no consistent  effect on the substitution  rate (Figure  5). Several  
experiments  also failed to observe  a consistent  effect of increasing  amounts  of 
concentrate  on substitution,  (Meijs and Hoekstra,  1984; Kibon and Holmes,  1984;  
Opatpatanakit  et al., 1993) probably  because  high producing  dairy cows rarely  
approach  their intake capacity  under  grazing  conditions  (see Figure  3). Indeed,  the 
substitution  rate increases  slightly  with the amount  of concentrate  (Meijs,  1981; Hijink  et 
al., 1982)  when unrestricted  fresh grasses  are fed indoors.  At grazing,  the reduction  in 
herbage  intake  is essentially  mediated  by a reduction  of 10 - 20 min per kg concentrate  
DM in time spent  grazing  (Combellas  et al., 1979; Kibon  and Holmes  1987; Delagarde, 
unpublished).

Feeding  moderate  amounts  of concentrate  also linearly  increases  protein  content  in milk 
(+ 0.25 g kg-1 per kg of concentrate  DM) but decreases  milk fat content  (- 0.6 g kg-^ per 
kg concentrate  DM) (Delaby  et al., 2001). This is primarily  due to a dilution  effect on 
milk fat, which increases  less rapidly  than milk yield. It may also be a consequence  of 
the rumen fermentation  pattern  because  the acetic to propionic  ratio in the rumen  
decreased  in supplemented  cows (Delagarde  et al., 1999 and unpublished).  Feeding  
concentrate  always  increases  body liveweight  gain (60 g kg ', Delaby  et al., 2001). A 
part of the extra amount  of energy  supplied  by concentrate  supplementation  is used to 
improve  body weight  and body condition  score during  the grazing  season. This may 
also explain  the Improvement  of the reproductive  performances  pointed  out by Murphy  
and Fitzgerald  (1998)  when cows are supplemented.
Interaction  between  supplementation  and grazing  conditions  
DHA has been recognised  for a long time as a major  factor affecting  the substitution  
between  grass and concentrate  (Meijs and Hoeskstra  1984; Stakelum  1986a; b; c; 
Kibon and Holmes,  1987; Grainger  and Mathews,  1989). From the analysis  of 48 
grazing  experiments,  Delagarde  and Peyraud  (unpublished)  have  demonstrated  that the 
substitution  rate (SR) between  grass and concentrate  is poorly  related  to the level of 
concentrate  but is primarily  a function  of the net energy  balance  (EB in MJ day')  of the 
unsupplemented  cows (SR = 0.32 + 0.10 EB, rsd = 0.19; Figure  8) as previously  shown  
forconsen/ed  forages  (Faverdin  et al., 1991). According  to this relationship,  the lower  
the energy  balance  the lower  the substitution  rate. The substitution  rate is only 0.1 when  
energy  needs  are far from being  covered  from grass  only (EB = -21 MJ or - 3 UFL) and 
increases  up to 0.6 when sward limitations  are minimised  (EB = 28 MJ or 4 UFL). 
Assuming  EB must be zero or slightly  positive  in the long term because  cows adjust  
their milk yield (see Figure  1), SR should  average  0.3- 0.4 in normal  grazing  conditions.  
This is a rather low value, which explains  recently  reported  high milk response  to 
supplementation.
In a similar  way, the efficiency  of supplementation  appears  to be closely  related  to the 
proportion  of requirement  that is met from grass alone. In a comprehensive  review.
39
Delaby  and Peyraud  (unpublished)  characterised  the severity  of the grazing  conditions  
in 95 experiments  by calculating  the difference  between  actual milk yield of 
unsupplemented  cows and their expected  milk yield (eMY),  assuming  that the greater  
the difference  between  actual and expected  milk yield (e g. eMY-aMY  for 
unsupplemented  cows)  the more adverse  the grazing  conditions  with respect  to animal  
demand. Response  of milk yield to increasing  levels of concentrate  was linear but 
highly variable  (Figure  9). The precision  of the prediction  sharply  increased  when  
grazing  conditions  are taken  into account.  The efficiency  of supplementation  is only 0.3 
when energy  needs  are met from grass alone but reaches  0.9 when pasture  intake  is 
restricted.  This principle  has also been demonstrated  in cows fed indoors  with fresh 
grass. Stockdale  and Trigg (1989)  reported  a marginal  response  of 1.8 kg milk per kg 
DM concentrate  when  cows  consumed  6.8 kg of pasture  DM each  day and the response  
dropped  to 0.6 when  cows consumed  11.6 kg DM of pasture.

As a consequence,  several  papers  have reported  that milk response  increases  when  
herbage  availability  is restricted.  This occurs  when stocking  rate is increased  on 
rotational  grazing  (Hoden  et al., 1991) or when sward  height  is reduced  in set stocking  
management  (Wilkins  et al., 1995). The interactions  between  level of concentrate  and 
DHA on milk response  to concentrate  are illustrated  in Figure  10. When herbage  is 
restricted,  there  was a linear  response  in milk up to  6 kg of concentrate  whereas  on high 
DHA the response  reached  a plateau  after 4 kg of concentrate.  The energy  balance  
may also differ according  to the quality  of grass. This is why the substitution  rate is 
positively  related  to herbage  digestibility  (Grainger  and Mathews,  1989). This also 
explains  why milk response  can increase  during  the grazing  season  when  grass  quality  
and grass  availability  are lowered.  Gleeson  (1981)  reported  a milk response  increasing  
from 0.2 in spring  to 0.6 in summer  and 0.9 in autumn  when pasture  provides  less 
energy  because  the grass quality  and availability  (fouled  area, moisture)  are lowered.  
Similarly,  several  studies  conducted  at Moorepark  (Stakelum,  1986a;  b and c; Murphy  
and Fitzgerald,  1998) have shown that the best responses  to concentrate  
supplementation  are generally  achieved  in summer  and autumn.  Thus,  it appears  there  
is scope  for substantial  improvement  in response  to supplementary  concentrate  inputs  
at grazing  provided  that inputs  should  be defined  according  to the grazing  conditions  
which determine  the energy  balance  of the unsupplemented  cows.
Figure  10. Interaction  between  level of concentrate  and herbage  allowance  on milk 
response  to supplementation  (after Delaby  et al., 2001)
Concentrate  (kg DM/day)
Feeding  concentrate  generally  decreases  the ruminal  pH and the acetate:propionate  
ratio. However  interactions  between  supplementation  and grazing  conditions  is also 
evident for the ruminal  digestion  processes.  Feeding  4 kg of cereal grains, has 
marginally  decreased  the acetate;propionate  ratio from 2.7 to 2.5 when herbage  
allowance  was restricted,  whereas  the same supplement  sharply decreased  the 
acetate:propionate  ratio from 2.6 to 1.8 on high herbage  allowance  because  cows  have  
access  to a more leafy diet, which  is more rapidly  fermented  (Delagarde  and Peyraud,  
unpublished).  The milk fat content  followed  similar  trends  with a larger  decrease  in high 
than in low allowance.
41
Nature  of the supplement
Herbage  intake  is more  drastically  lowered  when  cows  were supplemented  with forages  
than with concentrates  (Mayne  and Wright, 1988). Under  good grazing  conditions,  
giving  conserved  forages  (grass  silage,  hay or maize  silage)  as a buffer  feed, results  in 
high substitution  rates,  often over 1.0 (Leaver,  1985; Phillips  and Leaver,  1985; Phillips, 
1988). In these situations,  very low milk responses  or even a decrease  in milk yield 
compared  to control cows is obtained  (Bryant  and Donnelly,  1974; Leaver, 1985)  
because  net energy  content  is lower in conserved  grass than in fresh grass. No 
responses  in milk yield were reported  in France when spring swards were  
supplemented  with good quality  maize  silage  (Chenais  et al., 2001). The substitution  
rate between  fresh grass and buffer  forages  decreases  to 0.3 when the availability  of 
fresh forage  is restricted.  Therefore  forages  supplements  must only be provided  during  
periods  of grass  shortage.  The response  to supplementary  forages  is then much  higher  
in summer  than in spring  (Phillips  and Leaver,  1985).
Energy  source  in the concentrate  has little effect  on milk production  and substitution  rate 
when moderate  levels  of concentrate  are fed. Compared  to 3.5 kg of wheat,  which  is a 
readily  fermentable  starch, feeding  3.5 kg of a concentrate  rich in soya-bean  hulls,  
which  is a slowly  degraded  cellulose,  increased  milk fat content  (+ 1.3 g kg L Table 3), 
marginally  decreased  protein  content  (- 0.5 g kg-^) and did not affect  milk yield (Delaby  
and Peyraud,  1994). These  differences  between  starch  and fibre are even lower  when  
using a concentrate  rich in beet pulp and citrus pulps which are rich in rapidly  
fermentable  pectins (Delaby  and Peyraud,  1994; Meijs, 1986). The type of 
carbohydrate  does not affect the substitution  rate in indoors  trials (Spdrndly,  1991;  
Schwartz  et al., 1995). Under  good grazing  conditions  some  data suggest  a marginally  
(0.5 to 1.0 kg DM dayi) higher  DHI with fibre compared  to rapidly  degradable  starch 
(Kibon  and Holmes,  1987; Fisher  et al., 1996; Sayers  et al., 2000). However  when 
grass availability  is restricted  there is no substitution  whatever  the origin of the 
carbohydrate  (Kibon  and Holmes,  1987; Delagarde  etai, 1999). These  results  suggest  
that when moderate  amounts  of concentrate  are delivered,  the nature  of energy  does 
not necessarily  produce  enough  digestive  perturbations  to affect  animal  performances.  
However  because  the effect of supplementation  on ruminal  digestion  is much higher  
when  cows have access  to a high content  of free leaf blades,  concentrate  supplements  
only moderately  rich in rapidly  degradable  starch  are preferred  since  the effects  of highly  
fermentable  starch increases  when high doses were used. Sayers  et al., (2000)  
compared  high starch  and high fibre concentrate  either  at 5 or at 10 kg DM day’. They 
reported  a dramatic  fall in milk fat content  with increasing  amounts  of starch  (29.9 vs 
36.6 g kg ’) but not with increasing  amounts  of fibre (36.2 vs 39.4 g kg ’).
Generally  there should  be little need to supplement  dairy cows with protein  sources  at 
grazing. However,  when the crude protein content of grass becomes  low 
supplementation  with metabolisable  protein  may be beneficial.  Delaby  et al., (1996)  
described  the response  curve  of milk yield when increasing  the supply  of MP. On well 
fertilised  swards,  with crude  protein  content  greater  than 16 % DM, milk yield marginally  
increases  with protein  supply  whereas  on low N fertilised  swards,  with a crude  protein 
content  lower  than 13 % DM, the response  may reach  2 kg milk for a supply  of a extra  
amount  of 500 g of metablisable  protein. The lower the protein  content  of grass the 
higher  is the response.  In these situations,  feeding  concentrate  with low degradable
42
protein  may alleviate  a shortage  of metabolisable  protein  supply  to the cow, as duodenal  
flow of protein  is sharply  increased.  As herbage  intake  is increased,  total energy  inputs  
also increase  (Table  4).

Conclusion
Grazed  grass is the cheapest  source  of nutrients  for dairy cows and should  form the 
basis of profitable  animal  production  systems,  and present  a positive  image  of animal  
production  to the consumers  in Europe. Management  of high producing  animals  at 
pasture  is therefore  a major challenge.  The objective,  is to achieve  high levels of 
herbage  intake  per animal  with full exploitation  of the potential  of grazed  grass. Critical  
factors  affecting  intake  include  supplement  feeding,  sward  characteristics  and the cow 
itself Recent  results  show  that high producing  cows  can still achieve  satisfactory  levels  
of performances  with high economic  returns  and only a moderate  supply  of concentrate,  
although  they do not fully exploit  their genetic  potential.  Given  recent  developments  in 
our understanding  of sward factors  influencing  grass intake and digestion,  there is 
considerable  scope  to improve  animal  performances  with grazed  grass  diets.

Introduction
Milk production  in Ireland  is characterised  by relatively  lo\« milk production  per cow and 
low costs of production.  This is primarily  due to seasonal  calving,  and a pasture  based  
system  of milk production  (Dillon  et at, 1995). Since  the early 1950 ’s, a large number  
of studies have quantified  the response  in milk production  to supplementing  grazing  
dairy cows with concentrate.  The principal  factors  controlling  the response  have been 
identified  as the quantity  and quality  of the herbage  allowed,  milk yield potential  and 
stage of lactation  of cow plus the quantity  and nature  of the supplement.  Flistorical 
reviews  by Leaver  et at (1968)  and Journet  and Dermarquilly  (1979)  obtained  average  
responses  of 0.4 and 0.6 kg milk per kg of concentrate  DM respectively.  A more recent  
review by Stakelum  eta!., (1988)  indicated  a mean  response  of 0.5 kg milk/kg  additional  
concentrate.  Based  on these responses  it was generally  accepted  that when grass  
supply was adequate,  concentrate  supplementation  at pasture  was not economically  
justified  (ased  on concentrate  to milk price ratio). Flowever,  in data published  since 1990 
(Peyraud,  2001), responses  to concentrate  supplementation  at pasture  are higher.  
Overall  responses  close  to or greater  than 1.0 kg of milk per kg DM of concentrate  have  
been reported  when less than 4 to 5 kg DM of concentrate  is provided  with high yielding  
cows.
It can be argued  that the higher  responses  are related  to the genetic  merit  of the present  
(fay Holstein-Friesian  cow. The rate of genetic  improvement  for milk production  per cow 
in Ireland up to the-mid  1980's  was low (approximately  0.5% per year) compared  to 
North America  where  it was increasing  at 1.5% per year (Funk,  1983). Flowever,  since  
1985 the rate of genetic  improvement  in Ireland  has increased  markedly  to about 1.3%  
per year in 1992 (Coffey,  1992). This high rate of genetic  progress  has been achieved  
mainly through  the importation  of North American  and European  Al Holstein  Friesian  
genetics.
The average  level of concentrate  supplementation  (kg/cow/lactation)  in spring  calving  
dairy herds  in Ireland  is 745 kg (Buckley  etal.,  2000). The objective  of the present  study  
was to determine  the response  of Holstein-Friesian  cows of medium  and high genetic  
merit to half and twice the industry  norm level of concentrate  supplementation  in an 
adequate  grass supply  situation.  As a consequence,  this study sought  to answer  the 
following  questions:
• To determine  responses  of Holstein  Friesian  cows to increasing  levels of 
concentrate  supplementation  in an adequate  grass  supply  situation  over three  
years.
49
To examine  if milk yield responses  to supplementary  concentrate  are 
influenced  by genetic  merit (milk yield).
To determine  the economic  implications  of different  levels of concentrate  
supplementation  at farm level under  different  critical  cost/price  variables  and 
milk quota  scenarios.
Experimental  Details
Location  of study
The study was undertaken  from January  1998 to December  2000 at Moorepark  
Research  Centre  (Curtins  Farm). The soil type was free-draining,  acid brown  earth on 
a sandy  loam to loam texture.
Climate
All three  years  were normal  in terms  of summer  rainfall  and spring  temperature.
Experimental  design
The study compared  2 levels  of genetic  merit by 3 levels  of concentrate  feeding  on a 
spring calving  system  of milk production  over three years (1998-2000).  The mean 
predicted  difference  (PDOO) and economic  breeding  index (EBIOO) for the two 
genotypes  are shown  in Table 1. On average  the EBI of the high merit  cows (HM) was 
120.3 higher  than the medium  merit (MM) cows. However  there was large variation  in 
genetic  merit  within  genotype  with large  overlap  between  genotype.  Figure  1 shows  the 
individual  cow distribution  in PD for milk yield for each genotype.  The average  
proportion  of Holstein-Friesian  genes in the HM and MM cows was 65% and 75% 
respectively.

The concentrate  suppiementation  strategy  over  the grazing  season  is shown  in Table  3. 
The concentrate  was fed individually  twice  daily in the milking  pariour,  except  during  the 
indoor period in eariy spring  when cows  were fed three times daiiy in the HC system.  
The composition  of the concentrate  was 25% bariey,  25% corn giuten  feed, 25% beet 
pulp, 10% soya bean meal, 10% rapeseed  meal, 1% fat and 4% minerals  and vitamins.

Grazing  management
A permanent  grassland  site was used consisting  of a sward  with almost  100%  perennial 
ryegrass  (Lolium  Perenne).  The grazing  season  extended  from late February  until late 
November  each year. On turnout  to pasture,  animals  were grazed  on a rotational 
management  system  (Dillon  et al., 1995). Each  concentrate  feeding  system  had its own 
farmlet  comprising  of 18 paddocks.  Similar  pre-grazing  yields  were maintained  each 
week in each farmlet. This was facilitated  by weekly  monitoring  of farm grass cover  
(O’Donovan,  2000). Similar  post-grazing  heights  were also maintained  in each system.  
Table  4 shows  the average  pre- and post- grazing  heights,  pre-grazing  yields  and daily 
herbage  allowance  (kg DM/cow)  for each of the feeding  systems  averaged  over the 
three years.

Animal  management
Post-calving  in 1998 all cows  were offered  similar  level of concentrate  supplementation  
until late-April.  In late-April  48 HM and 48 MM cows balanced  for calving  date and milk 
yield were randomly  assigned  to the three  concentrate  feeding  treatments.  Once  cows  
were  assigned  to a feeding  system,  they remained  on it for the three  years. In 1999  and 
2000, 18 and 12 first lactation  cows  entered  the herd as replacements  of similar  genetic 
merit to that of the cows culled.
52
Milk yield was recorded  on five consecutive  days per week. The concentration  of fat, 
protein  and lactose  was determined  in one successive  morning  and evening  sample  per 
week. First lactation  animals  were given a 10-week  dry period,  while in subsequent  
lactations  8 weeks was considered  sufficient.  During  the dry period animals  were  
offered  grass silage ad-libitum.  Cows  at the end of first lactation  were offered  2 kg of 
concentrate  daily for the first 5 weeks  of the dry period.
The breeding  season  was confined  to 13 weeks,  starting  in late April. Each  year artificial  
insemination  only was used for the whole  of the breeding  season.  Tail paint  was used  
as an aid to heat detection.  Pregnancy  diagnosis  was performed  by ultrasonography  30 
to 40 days after service  and by rectal palpation  6 weeks  after the end of the breeding  
season.
Results
Milk production  (a) Herd  comparison
Table 5 shows  the average  milk production  for the three  years  of the experiment.  There  
was no significant  interaction  between  genetic  merit and feeding  system  for any of the 
milk production  parameters  measured.  However  both genotypes  and feeding  systems  
had a significant  effect on milk yield and milk composition  parameters.  The exception  
was feeding  system  which  had no effect  on lactose  content.  On average  over the three  
years the HM cows produced  1066 kg higher  milk production,  1.7 g/kg lower  fat content  
and 0.82 g/kg lower  protein  content  compared  to the MM cows.

Table 6 shows the differences  in PD’s for milk, fat and protein  yield and actual milk 
production  with level of feeding.  The differences  in actual  milk production  between  the 
genotypes  were much larger  in the HC systems  than in the other  two systems.

The response  to feeding  concentrate  is shown  in Table  7, and is calculated  as the extra 
kg milk (or fat plus protein)  produced  from the extra concentrate  fed in the MC and HC 
systems  relative  to the LC. There  appears  to be a higher  response  for the HM cows 
especially  at the higher  concentrate  feeding  level (HC).

Milk production  (b) Individual  cow data
As can be seen from Figure  1, there is a large overlap  in genetic  merit between  the two 
genetic  groups,  hence it was decided  to investigate  further relationships  between  
experimental  milk yield using both pre-experimental  milk yield (milk production  as first 
lactation  animals  in April 1998) and pedigree  index with concentrate  supplementation  
level. There was a significant  interaction  between  feeding  system  and both pre- 
experimental  milk yield and pedigree  index  (Figure  2) for milk yield over the three  years  
of the study. The difference  between  the concentrate  feeding  systems  increases  as 
both pre-experimental  milk yield increase  and pedigree  index for milk production  
increases.  Similar  results  are obtained  for protein  production  with pre-experimental  
protein  yield and pedigree  index  for protein  production  (Figure  3).
Table  8 shows  that the response  to increasing  concentrate  supplementation  from 0.495  
to 1.700 t /cow/lactation  was 0.35, 1.06, and 1.33 kg milk/kg  of concentrate  fed for 
primiparous  cows  with pre-experimental  milk yields  of <24, 24-28,  and >28 kg milk/day  
respectively.  Similarly  the response  is 0.41, 0.76 and 1.33 for PD milk of <100, 100 to 
200 and 200 to 300 kg of milk respectively  (Table  9). Both tables  indicate  that at the  low 
level of concentrate  supplementation  genetic  potential  is being restricted  with high 
yielding/high  genetic  merit Holstein-Friesian  dairy cows.

Tables 10 and 11 show  the effect of genotype  and feeding  system  on live-weight  and 
live-weight  change  for 1999 and 2000, respectively.  In both years  both genotypes  had 
similar  live-weight  post-calving,  week  8 of lactation  and at the end of lactation.  Also in 
early lactation  both genotypes  had similar  liveweight  loss, while  from week  8 to the end 
of lactation  there was a tendency  for higher  liveweight  gain with the MM cows. In both
55
years feeding  systems  had a significant  effect on liveweight  at all three stages  of 
lactation,  the highest  with the HC and lowest  with the LC feeding  system. However 
feeding  system  had no significant  effect  on liveweight  change.

Condition  score
Tables  12 and 13 show  the effect  of genotype  and feeding  system  on condition  score 
and condition  score change  for 1999 and 2000, respectively.  The HM cows had 
significantly  lower  condition  score  at all three stages  of laaation  in both years. In both 
years  the HM cows  had significantly  greater  condition  score  loss in early lactation.  Also 
from week 8 to the end of lactation  the condition  score  gain was greater  with the MM 
cows. Feeding  system  had a significant  effect  on condition  score  at all three  stages  of 
lactation  in both years. The highest  condition  was obtained  with the HC system,  and the 
lowest  with the LC system. Feeding  system  had very little effect on condition  score  
change.

DM intake  estimates
Tabie 14 shows  the effect  of both genetic  merit  and feeding  system  on grass  DM intake  
(GDMI)  and total DM intake  (TDMI)  in mid May and late August  for each of the three  
years. On average  over the three years  the HM cows had 1 kg higher  GDMI  (16.1 vs 
15.1). Over the three years  of the study  the average  GDMI  for all cows  was 13.8,15.2  
and 17.8 kg for 1998,1999  and 2000 respectively.  Feeding  system  had a significant  
effect on both GDMI and TDMI. The highest  GDMI  was achieved  with the LC feeding  
system  and highest  TDMI  with the HC feeding  system.  Substitution  rates (kg reduction  
in GDMI/kg  increase  in concentrate  DM intake)  range from 0.88 to 0.22. The higher  
substitution  rates were obtained  in 1998 and the lowest  in 2000.

Reproductive  performance
The reproductive  performance  averaged  over the three years  is shown  in Table 15. No 
significant  effect of genotype  or feeding  system  on any of the fertility parameters  
measured  was observed. However  there were large differences  in reproductive  
performances  between  years, with the poorest  being achieved  in 2000. The 
reproductive  performance  of the MM cows  tended  to be better  on average  for all fertility  
parameters  measured  than the HM cows. Feeding  systems  had very little effect on 
reproductive  performance  other than the pregnancy  rate to 2«i service  tended  to be 
higher  for the HC feeding.

Economic  analysis
The milk production  performance  achieved  in the LC and HC feeding  systems  was used 
for economic  analysis.  The Moorepark  Farm Economic  Model  (Veerkamp  et al, 2001)  
was used  to compare  the economic  performance  of the different  systems.  The following  
assumptions  were used in the model  farm:
Quota  size 
Farm size 
Enterprise 
Concentrate  cost 
Milk price
Quota  leasing  charges  
Qpportunity  cost of land227,000  litres  
16.2 hectares  
Dairying  
£150/tonne  
22p/litres  
7.7p/litres  
£371/hectare
Using  the production  performance  achieved  in the LC feeding  system  as the control,  the 
farm profit achieved  was £28,129  (excluding  labour  and living expenses  costs). Using  
the assumption  in the farm model  increasing  concentrate  feeding  to the level of the HC 
feeding  system  increased  farm profit  to £29,080  (+£951).  However  if it was not possible  
to lease milk to maintain  cow numbers  then farm profit  was reduced  to £27,242  (-£887).
The difference  in farm profit as effected  by key critical  variables  such as concentrate  
cost (£100,  £125,  £150,  £175  and £200A),  milk price (18p, 20p, 22p, 24p and 26p/litre),  
quota leasing  charges  (4.4p, 5.5p, 6.6p, 7.7p, 8.8p/litre)  and opportunity  cost of land 
(£247, £309, £371, £432, and £494/ha)  on the economics  of feeding  the HC feeding  
system  is shown  in Figure  4. In all scenarios  (execpt  where  concentrate  costs  was less 
than £100/t)  where  quota  leasing  was not available  i.e. cow numbers  are reduced,  there  
was a reduction  in farm profit with the HC system.  Where  quota leasing  was possible  
(i.e. cow numbers  maintained)  the critical  variables  were concentrate  and leasing  quota  
costs, plus milk price. Opportunity  cost of land had only a small  effect  on farm profit. In
59
situations  of low concentrate  costs (< £125/t),  high milk price (>24p/l),  and low quota  
leasing  charges  (<6.6p/l)  opting  for the HC system  will result  in an increase  of £1,600  to 
£2,600  in farm profit. However  at high concentrate  costs (>£150/t),  low milk price 
(<22p/l),  and high quota  leasing  charges  (>6.6p/l)  there was no financial  benefit  to the 
HC system.
Table 17 shows  the effect of varying  response  rates (kg milk/kg  concentrate  fed) to 
feeding  the higher  concentrate  level (HC). The same  assumptions  were used as that in 
the farm model. The results  indicate  that the response  would  have to be greater  than 
0.80 kg of milk per kg of concentrate  to be economic  in a quota-leasing  scenario.  As 
shown  earlier  this will very much  depend  in the genetic  merit  (milk yield potential)  of the 
herd.

Summary
The average  milk production  of 7,228 kg/cow  with the HM cows on the LC feeding  
system  indicates  the relatively  high milk production  potential  of high merit cows in an 
Irish grass based feeding  system. This is much higher  than that achieved  in other  
countries  in grass based  systems.  Kolver  (2001)  obtained  a milk production  of 4,678  
kg/cow  with high merit North  American  Holstein-Friesian  genetics  in a low stocked  New 
Zealand  grazing  system.  Fulkerson  (2000)  obtained  a milk production  of 4,953  kg/cow  
with high merit North American  Holstein-Friesian  cows in an Australian  production 
system.  In the present  study  the LC feeding  system  restricted  the ability  of the HM cows  
to express  fully there  genetic  potential.  In the LC system  production  potential  is reduced  
by cow size and condition  score  at calving,  other  than level of feeding  post-calving.  The 
average  milk yield of 9105 kg/cow  with the HM cows in the HC feeding  system  in 2000  
would indicate  milk production  was close to genetic  potential  using US milk yield as a 
comparison.
The HM cows produced  1066 kg higher  milk yield, 29 kg higher  fat yield and 31 kg 
higher  protein  yield than the MM cows. The difference  between  genotypes  was much  
larger  on the HC feeding  system  than either  of the other two systems.  The average  
response  to concentrate  supplementation  was 0.71 kg milk/kg  of concentrate  fed for the 
MC and HC feeding  systems  relative  to the LC feeding  systems  over the three years.  
However  analysis  of individual  cow data indicated  an interaction  between  genetic  merit 
and concentrate  feeding  level for both milk and protein  yield. This indicated  a higher  
milk yield response  to concentrate  supplementation  with the higher  genetic  merit cows.  
Using pre-experimental  milk yields  of <24, 24 to 28 and >28 kg/day  as first lactation  
animals  the response  to increasing  supplement  from 0.495  to 1.7 t/lactation  was 0.41, 
0.76 and 1.33 kg respectively/kg  of concentrate  fed.
60
Genotype  had no significant  effect on live weight,  while the cows in the HC feeding  
system  were of significantly  higher  live weight. Both genotype  and feeding  system  had 
no significant  effect  on live weight  change  in early lactation  (weeks  1 to 8). There  was 
a trend towards  better live weight  gain with the MM cows in weeks  8 to the end of 
lactation. The condition  score  of the MM cows was significantly  higher  at all stages  of 
lactation. Similarly  the condition  score  of the MM cows in the HC feeding  system  were  
higher  than in the LC feeding  system.
The GDMI estimates  of the high merit cows  were on average  1kg higher  than the MM 
cows. The highest  GDMI was achieved  with the LC feeding  system,  while the higher  
TDMI was with the HC system. Substitution  rates range  from 0.88 to 0.22kg  reduction  
GDMI/kg  increase  in concentrate  DM allocation.  The higher  substitution  rates were  
obtained  in 1998 and the lowest  in 2000.
Genotype  had no significant  effect on reproductive  performance,  however  the 
reproductive  performance  of the MM cows was better  for all reproductive  parameters  
measured. Concentrate  feeding level had no significant  effect on reproductive  
performance  over the three years. There were big differences  in reproductive  
performance  between  the three  years  with the poorest  in 2000 .
There was a reduction  in farm profit  in almost  all scenarios  with the HC feeding  systems  
where  cow numbers  had to be reduced  (no quota  leasing  scenario).  In scenarios  where  
quota leasing  was achieved  at <6.6 p litre and concentrate  cost less than £115/tonne  
and/or milk price was around  24 p/litre there was an economic  advantage  of approx.  
£1600  to £2600  to the HC feeding  system.  However  when  milk price was less than 22 
p/litre, concentrate  cost greater  then £150/t  and quota  leasing  costs  were greater  than 
6.6 p/litre, there was no economic  advantage  in the HC feeding  system.

Byelaws  and Farming  Practices
PATRICK  J. PHELAN  
Teagasc,  Dromin  Road,  Nenagh
Land usage
The agricultural  area of Ireland  is approximately  4.5 million  ha of which  3.6 million  ha is 
under grass, 0.5 million ha is under rough grazing  and 0.4 million  ha is under  crops  
(OAFF,  2001). In 2000  there  was 408,000  tonnes  of Nitrogen  (N) and 49,000  tonnes  of 
Phosphorus  (P) applied.
Land - a critical  and essential  resource
Land yields food and water. Both are essential  to the survival  of present  and future  
generations.  In order to ensure  the survival  of our children,  of their children,  of their 
children’s  children,  we must manage  our land resources  so that quality  food and water  
can be harvested  into the future.  The intensive  food production  needed  to meet  growing  
population  and the income  demands  of farm families  has resulted  in high stocking  rates  
and intensive  farmyard  usage.
High stocking  rates
High stocking  rates require  high inputs  to produce  fodder. Nitrogen  and P application  to 
land have resulted  in huge yield increases  in grass and crop yields. However  those  
same nutrients,  particularly  P also give huge increases  in algal and plant growth  if they 
end up in surface  water. Excessive  growth  of algae  and plants  makes  water  unsuitable  
for drinking,  for fish life and for leisure  activities.
Intensive  farmyards
High animal numbers  either  for wintering  or daily movement  for milking  requires  the 
collection  of high volumes  of animal  dung, urine and dairy wash water. Animal  wastes  
if used efficiently  are a valuable  source  of nutrients  but if allowed  to escape  present  a 
serious  hazard  to water  quality. Fifty cattle  wintered  in a yard, with no facilities  to collect  
animal  wastes,  would  produce  approximately  700 kg N and 100 kg P. These  quantities  
of nutrients  and the biological  oxygen  demand  would  produce  serious  quality  problems  
if added  to water.
Targeting  of resources  to reduce  loss of Phosphorus  from Agricultural  land to 
water
In order to improve  water  quality  the sources  of contamination  must be identified  and 
remedial  measures  put in place. Research  indicates  that 80 to 90 % of P losses  from 
land to water  occur  from as little as 10 % of the land area draining  to any given water  
catchment.  The Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA) (1999)  has indicated  that the 
best improvement  in water  quality  will be achieved  by targeting  control  programmes  to 
those areas. Geographical  Information  System  (GIS) based  assessment  is recommend  
by both the EPA and Department  of Environment  and Local Government  (DOELG)  as 
the best means  of identifying  hotspots  and targeting  resources.
63
The Need  for By-laws
Surface  Water
Water  quality  monitoring  by the EPA (1999)  has identified  an increase  in the extent  of 
slight and moderate  pollution  in Ireland ’s rivers  and streams.  This is attributed  mainly 
to “animal manures  and artificial  fertilisers,  and to a lesser extent to point source 
discharges  e g. sewage.  The recent  slight increase  in the extent  of seriously  polluted 
channels  is attributed  mainly  to suspected  sewage  discharges  and to a lesser  degree  to 
suspected  agricultural  activities ”. The report formed  the basis for the requirements  
under  the P Regulations  (S.l. No. 258 of 1998, Local Government  (Water  Pollution)  Act, 
1977 (Water  Quality  Standards  for P) Regulations,  1998). One of the indicators  of 
achievement  under  those  regulations  is the introduction  of new by-laws.  DOELG  (1997)  
has stressed  the need to manage  rivers  and lakes  and reduce  enrichment  of water  with 
nutrients,  particularly  P by focusing  on the main contributors  - agriculture,  sewage  and 
industry.
Ground  Water
Irish ground  waters  are generally  of high quality. The main concern  is the presence  of 
faecal  conforms  in some  samples  analysed  by the EPA. Faecal  contamination  has been  
identified  as a serious problem  in samples  from private water schemes. This 
contamination  is most  likely  due to either  sewage  or animal  manures.  High nitrate  levels  
(i.e. mean  concentrations  >50 mg/I) have been identified  by the EPA in Carlow,  Kildare,  
Limerick  and Louth. Agricultural  practices  are suspected  as contributing  to the elevated 
levels.
Response
The introduction  of by-laws  is a response  by Local Authorities  (Cork County  Council  
(1999),  Cavan  County  Council  (2000),  Tipperary  North Riding  County  Council  (2000)  
and Westmeath  County  Council  (2000)  and a recommendation  of the Lough  Derg and 
Lough  Ree Catchment  Monitoring  and Management  System  (2001)  to the nutrient  load 
to water from agriculture.  Byelaws  are also an option to be considered  for the 
catchments  of the Boyne,  Liffey and Suir by the Three  Rivers  Project  Water  (2000)  in 
the event  of failure  to put adequate  voluntary  measures  in place. Inadequate  storage  of 
organic  materials  in farmyards,  poor timing of application  and excessive  nutrient 
application  are the issues  to be resolved.
Lough  Derg and Lough  Ree Catchment  Monitoring  and Management  System  
The Lough  Derg and Lough  Ree Catchment  Monitoring  and Management  System  was 
the first major  catchment-based  water management  project  in Ireland. Its objectives 
were to identify  and locate  pollution  problems  within  the Derg and Ree catchments  and 
to recommend  control  strategies.  The principal  findings  relevant  to agriculture  were  
from four Special  Study sub-catchments,  three  Agricultural  mini-catchments  and from 
the development  of GIS.

Water quality  was determined  by analysis  of grab samples  taken  twice each week.

However  the median  oxidised  nitrogen  levels  are a cause  for concern.  The dissolved  
oxygen levels also indicate  poor water quality. The median  MRP in the Bellsgrove  
exceeded  the minimum  median  target  of 30 ug P/I specified  in the P Regulations.  The
65
maximum  MRP level recorded  was 296 ug P/I. Median  oxidised  nitrogen  and dissolved  
oxygen  levels  were also unsatisfactory.  The Grange  Rahara  had satisfactory  nutrient  j 
levels  during  the sampling  period.
Geographical  Information  System
A GIS was used to investigate  the relationship  between  agricultural  factors  and water 
quality. A P ranking  scheme  was produced  by giving  a weighting  to each factor  and a 
score determined  by intensity. This enabled  the production  of a map of Potential  
Agricultural  Risk Areas  within  the Derg and Ree catchment.

This resulted  in most townlands  in the Clarianna  being classed  as high risk, the 
Bellsgrove  as very high risk and the Grange  Rahara  as being medium  risk. Byelaws  
were consequentially  recommended  for the Clarianna  and the Bellsgrove.
County  Implementation  of Byelaws
To date bye-laws  have  been  introduced  in three  catchments  in Cork  to address  identified  
water quality  problems,  and in town lands identified  by the P ranking  scheme  in the 
counties  Cavan,  Tipperary  NR., and Westmeath.  Recommendations  for byelaws  have  
also been made in specified  areas in Counties  Leitrim, Longford  and Offaly.  
Requirements  in the bye-laws  areas  are for Nutrient  management  plans for significant  
pig and poultry  enterprises,  for storage  and management  of waste  on all farms,  and P 
fertiliser  applications  to be based  on NMP on all farms in town lands with high soil P 
levels. Record  keeping  by the farmer  is a requirement  in all cases.

Voluntary,  preventative  actions  are preferable  to byelaws.  All farmers  should  adoptIh  
Code of Good  Agricultural  Practices.  This should  result in improved  water  quality  ait 
reduce  the risk of byelaw  areas  being  extended.
Implications  of Byelaw  requirements  for farmers  i
Plans will have to be paid for, implemented  and reported  on. Nutrient  manageme  
plans should result in more precision,  better use of nutrients  and improved  co 
efficiency  on many  farms. Restrictions  on stocking  rates and N applications  will redin 
output on more intensive  farms. Improvements  or additional  storage  facilities  ar 
expensive  and will not generally  yield an economic  return. Failure  to comply  iss| 
offence  and liable  to penalties  under  Section  21 (3)(b) of the Local Government  (Wal| 
Pollution)(Amendment)  Act, 1990.
Farmer  attitudes  to water  quality
Farmers  are concerned  about  water  quality  perse,  but their major  concerns  relate  to 
financial  implications  for themselves  and the threat  of increased  paperwork.  They  al 
fear that achieving  improvements  in water quality  will result in restrictions  to faij
68
management  practices  and decreased  incomes.  They are aware  that ^everyone  will 
benefit  from improved  water  quality. Many  would  like to see “everyone  pay for those  
improvements  or at least be given an opportunity  to pay for it. Suggestions  made by 
farmers  on financing  such improvements  included;
i) The State provides  a grant scheme,  not restricted  to income  units or production  
targets,  for improved  facilities  to protect  water  quality  on byelaw  areas.
ii) Reduced  interest  rates should  be made  to provide  facilities.
iii) Income  tax incentives  should  be provided.
iv) The consumer  could  be given  the option  of paying  a voluntary  levy on farm produce  
to assist improvements  or indeed  to compensate  farmers  who have provided  and 
manage  facilities  properly.
v) Compensation  should  be paid for loss of income.
Water  quality  is suffering  due to agricultural  activities.  The strategy  to minimise  pollution  
at present  is to identify  the factors  and areas  doing  the most  damage  and to concentrate  
resources  in those  areas. The introduction  of byelaws  by some  local authorities  is seeri  
as a means  of meeting  obligations  to improve  water  quality. EU directives  and national  
regulations  are here to stay, so are the EPA, DOELG,  the Local Authorities  and the 
requirement  for good quality  water. It is in the interest  of farmers  and the nation  to 
ensure that Irish Agriculture  does not fade away. The survival  of farming  and its 
potential  to progress  will be strongly  influenced  by the will and ability of farmers  to 
respond  to the challenge  of maintaining  quality  clean  water  and improving  quality  where  
damage  has occurred.

Farming  Profitably,  efficiently,  and with due care for the Environment

Crookstown,  Co. Cork
Background
Helen and I milk a spring  calving  herd of 55 cows supplying  Dairygold  Coop. We rear 
all our replacements  and some beef on 39 ha of grassland  of which 13 ha are rented.  
The farm is situated  near Crookstown  Village  in mid-Cork,  just off the N22 - the main 
Cork-Macroom  - Killarney  route over looking  the Bride Valley. The farm ranges  from 
300 - 600 ft. above  sea level with a relatively  steep  fall on one third of the farm. The 
farm has a southerly  aspect,  which enhances  spring turnout. However,  in very dry 
weather  like June  2001 we suffered  from drought.  The soil consists  of a loamy  soil type 
to a depth  of 6 - 9 inches  over old red sandstone  giving  a relatively  free draining  soil.

Farming  and the Environment
Farmers  throughout  the country  are nowadays  subject  to various  County  Council 
byelaws,  codes  of practice  and inland  fisheries  inspections.  By now you will all have 
received  and read the Good Farming  Practice  booklet  sent out by Minister  Walsh  
recently.
70
What is Good Farming  Practice?
Good Farming  Practice  is common  sense  farming  which  cares  for the environment  and 
meets minimum  hygienic  and animal  welfare  standards ’ — quote  from the booklet.  As a 
farmer I see no conflict  between  good farming  practices  and care for the environment.  
A large number  of farmers  are complying  with this code already  including  the 45,000  
farmers  who are in Rural Environment  Protection  Scheme  (REPS),  therefore  we have 
nothing  to fear. However,  it is important  for the authorities  to allow ample  time to digest  
this new code and common  sense must prevail when the relevant  authorities  are 
carrying  out inspections.  Farmers  have shown  over  the past 3 years  that they are quick  
to follow Teagasc  advice  when the new Phosphates  recommendations  were issued  - 
late 1997.
Using soil analysis  and proper  nutrient  management  planning  we have seen a 20% 
decrease  in national  sales  of both Phosphorus  (P) & Potash  (K). To such an extent  that 
there is now cause  for concern  in Teagasc  and the fertilizer  industry  concerning  the big 
decrease  in K levels. As a farmer,  while we strived  hard to get P levels under  control  
we may have  taken  our eye off K levels. This is certainly  the situation  in my case,  which  
you will see later on. So we need to take corrective  action  to rectify  this imbalance.
Storage
The proper management  and storage  of slurry and other waste will involve  good  
buildings  and proper  storage  facilities.  On our farm we have;  - 
A covered  slatted  tank with slurry  storage  for 12 weeks;
All rainwater  is diverted  away  from slurry  and effluent  tanks;
All dairy washings  and soiled  water  are stored  with the silage  effluent  and is 
spread  via a sprinkler  system  on nearby  paddocks.
It is vital that all slurry  tanks  are empty  by late summer.
Fertilizer/Slurry  Programme
I will outline  how my programme  has evolved  since 1997.
Prior to 1997 silage  ground  received;
2000 gallons  slurry/acre  + 2 bags/ac  0.7.30.  in Winter/Spring  
57 kg/ha (46 Units/ac)  of urea Nitrogen  in January  
Graze silage  ground  in spring.
86 kg/ha (70 Units/ac)  of urea Nitrogen  for 1=> cut in late March
1500 gallons  slurry/acre  + 3.5 bags/ac  Cut Sward  (24-2.5-10)  in May/June
CAN (27.5%N)  for aftergrass  in July
A comprehensive  soil analysis  in 1997 produced  the following  results.  -

The S signifies  silage field for one or two cuts. You can see at a glance  that our 
phosphorus  levels  were quite high.
For 1998 - 2000  we amended  our fertilizer  plan as follows;-
Eliminated  2-3 bags/ac  of 0.7.30.  and Urea for 1=' cut silage.  Also changed  to Super  Cut 
(Cut Sward  and 3.5%Sulphur)  for 2"'^ cut silage. Timing  of slurry application  was also 
improved.
We have become  more conscious  about  the timing  of spreading  slurry  and make  better  
use of weather  forecasts  when planning  to spread. Due to paddocks  being closed  in 
mid October  for the following  spring  there are heavier  grass cover  on fields receiving  
slurry. Therefore  there is more leaf in the sward to take up the fertilizer/slurry  so 
avoiding  leeching  and run-off. By spreading  in the springtime  the plant can utilise  the 
Nitrogen  in the slurry  more efficiently.
Following  further  sampling  in December  2000 we noticed  our P level had dropped  but 
still remained  good. However,  our K level was much  too low and action  needed  to be 
taken.

From 1996 - 2000 we have reduced  our fertilizer  cost by Ip/gal. We have still grown  
the same  amount  of grass  with no loss in performance.  We had planned  to reduce  our 
fertilizer  cost further  this year but the price increase  in 2001 will claw back our savings.
72
In December  2001 we will soil sample  these  fields again to see if we have turned  the 
corner  as regards  K level or whether  we will have  to continue  with further  inputs  of K to 
bring it to an acceptable  level for best performance.
Summary
I hope I have given you a good insight  into my simple  farming  practices.  You can also 
see from my paper  that it is possible  with proper  nutrient  management  to increase  profit  
without  any conflict  of interest,  while  still caring  for our environment.  It is in all our best 
interests  to practice  sustainable  farming  rather  than have further  legislation  imposed  on 
the agricultural  industry.
I would like to thank my Teagasc  adviser  Peter O’Leary for the past 25 years  for his 
advice  along with the many  other  advisers  with whom  I have been involved  with down

Technology  transfer  for my Farm
WILLIAM  KINGSTON  
Tooreen,  Caheragh,  Skibbereen,  Co. Cork
When  you hear of technology  transfer,  I am sure you all think off e-mail,  text messages,  
gigabytes  and hard disks. However  to me and on my dairy  farm,  technology  has a much 
simpler  meaning.  Technology  provides  me with the tools  that enable  me to develop  my 
business  in the next 10-12  years. Once a business  has a clear and precise  vision  of 
where  it wants  to be the rest is relatively  easy. Today  I am going  to tell you where  I stand 
and how I plan to drive my business  forward  into the future. Following  on from this I will 
discuss  the technical  requirements  needed  to grow into the future.
I have heard it said that giving an army the best weapons  and technology  available  
doesn ’t guarantee  victory unless  the strategy  is right. Presently  a third year farm 
apprentice  (John Dillon)  and myself  run the farm, which  consists  of 150 spring  calving  
cows  and replacements  along  with some dry cattle. The milking  cows have access  to 
225 acres of grazing  land. I live in a part of the country  where  grass does not stop 
growing  and some  people  would  say it never  stops  raining  either. The system  that I am 
trying to put in place can be described  by two words. Profitability  and Simplicity.  
Profitability  is getting  the most money  out of a system  that doesn ’t need continuous  
reinvestment,  and comes  from making  the most out of the natural  advantages  of the 
farm and the ability  of the people  working  it. Simplicity  in the sense  that the farm can 
be easily  run, that the person  running  the farm is not literally  “running  everywhere ”, and 
that time can be dedicated  to certain  jobs at certain  times  of the year. It is also important  
that we enjoy  what we do.
The technology  required  to get a clear focus into the future is strategic  planning  - 
looking  ahead  and working  towards  a goal. Subconsciously  we all do some  of this with 
our aspirations.  Having  done  a course  with strategic  planning  as one of the core topics,  
I have acquired  a lot of knowledge  on how to make  a structured  approach  to planning.  
I am presently  putting  this into place. Having  worked  out what I want and where  I am 
going it is obvious  to me that four main areas  have to be considered.
1. The right breed  of cow
A vast amount  of research  has been done and is still being done on animal  breeds  & 
breeding.  What  I need is a cow that produces  a reasonable  amount  of high solids  milk, 
that requires  low maintenance  and can last at least 5-6 lactation ’s. In the past I have 
relied on the Al station  to produce  the best bulls and have selected  from them on the 
basis  of RBI and protein.  Moorepark  has trialled  these  high genetic  merit  animals  to see 
what they are capable  of doing,  but alas now that we all have reasonable  merit cows,  
we realise  that we have the wrong  ones - too high maintenance  costs due mainly  to 
infertility.  What  we need now is a planned  approach  to selectively  breeding  our way out 
of this problem.  This approach  is being tried in Moorepark.  Numerous  farmers  have 
taken  proactive  cross  breeding  genetics  from around  the world,  striving  to get their ideal 
cow. I am now finding  that the best technology  transfer  in this situation  is to make  direct 
contact  with the farmers  involved.
74
2. Business  management
This mainly  covers  progress  monitoring  of the targets  that have been set by planning.  
The area that requires  most attention  is budgets  and cash flow projections.  It is no 
longer  good enough  to meet the accountant  two months  after the end of the tax year 
and hear that meal feeding  has gone up, this information  is 12-15  months  out of date. 
A computer  is an aid that will help pull information  together,  but a word of warning  - 
spending  £1,500  on a modern  computer  and software  package  does not mean you 
become  an excellent  bookkeeper  over night. We constantly  bookmark  our production  
costs against  the top 5% and we need to do a lot more of this. Sourcing  these  figures  
may be difficult  but with the help of our advisor,  accountant  and other farmers  these  
figures  are out there.
3. Grass  & grassland  management
A long grazing  season  with quality  grass  is the best key to profit and simplicity.  Up to 5 
years  ago the method  of grass  seed selection  for me was to go down  to my local Co-op  
and look for Drinagh  No.2 - not the most scientific  approach  I must admit. From going  
to farm walks  I quickly  realised  that late heading  varieties  with early spring  growth  held 
the key. Moorepark  has done some excellent  research  on grass seed selection,  and 
from this and with the help of my Teagasc  advisor,  choosing  grass  seed has become  a 
lot easier. New grass varieties  are always  coming  through  and we need to get these  
production  traits onto our farms  as soon as possible.  On the grazing  front there is alot 
more trial and error Involved.  I feel that the ideal grass covers  for our farm are best 
found by referring  to as much historical  measurement  as possible.  This means  by 
having  at least the last two autumns  grass  cover  figures  in front of you when  the years  
budget  is being done. Measurement  is the most important  technology  throughout  the 
grazing  year to make  sure the cows are fully fed and that there is sufficient  grass  cover  
to carry over into the spring. On technology  transfer,  I do find the plate-meter  more  
constant  than eyeballing  if you are sending  different  people  out measuring  during  the 
grazing  season.
4. Labour  management
There are two areas  to labour,  one is labour  efficiency,  which  Tom Dunne  is covering  
tomorrow,  and the other  is labour  management.  One example  of labour  efficiency  is calf 
rearing.  Batch  rearing  calves,  once per day feeding  and early  turnout  to grass  has really  
changed  our approach  to calf rearing.  This technology  has come  from farm walks  and 
talking to other farmers. Teagasc  are doing a large scale project  on labour. The 
information  we need  from this survey  includes  opportunities  of saving  time economically,  
also it should  be complied  in a way that if I was building  a new milking  parlour,  I should  
see that a backing  gate will save 10 minutes,  a dump-line  30 minutes  in the spring,  and 
so on. From this information  it sould become  clear what is working  well at farm level 
and what is good sales talk. Labour  management  is another  large area. To motivate  
staff and keep them committed  and content  requires  a skill that has to be learned.  The 
use of a farm manual,  which  gives  exact  details  of tasks  and methods  employed,  is an 
excellent  idea that I know must be brought  onto my own farm. Things like 
communications,  bonuses  and time off that I am only getting  to grips  with. I find talking
75
to farmers  with staff as well as managers  of small businesses  gives me an insight  into 
the technology  that is required.
Summary
To summarise,  there  is a massive  challenge  in dairy  farming  today,  but concentrating  on 
key areas prevents  me from getting  bogged  down in the smaller  issues. A lot of 
technology  is out there,  and once you know  what you want, the use of the phone  or a 
trip to where  the information  can be gathered  is the simplest  and in my eyes the most 
efficient  way of getting  technology  back onto my farm as quickly  as possible.

The changing  Role of Technology  Transfer  in New Zealand
PETER  JENSEN  
Chairman,  Dexcel,  New Zealand
Introduction
In 1998 the New Zealand  industry  undertook  a significant  long-term  strategic  planning  
exercise,  which became  the springboard  for a series of changes  in the delivery  and 
effectiveness  of on-farm  research  and development.
Anew  Dairy  Industry  Restructuring  Bill is currently  being  considered  by the New  Zealand  
parliament,  and is expected  to be passed  in October.  The Bill will enable  the two large  
dairy manufacturing  companies.  Kiwi and the New Zealand  Dairy  Group,  to join with the 
New Zealand  Dairy Board  to become  a single  organisation  by June of next year. The 
New Zealand  Dairy Research  Institute,  which focuses  on dairy product  and process  
research  and development,  and ViaLactia  Biosciences,  which manages  the industry ’s 
investment  in biotechnology,  will become  subsidiary  organisations  of the new 
manufacturing  and marketing  company. The Bill also enables  the Livestock  
Improvement  Corporation  to become  a user-owned  co-operative.
This paper reports  on the subsequent  changes  in dairy farm production  research  and 
extension.
Funding  of Industry  Good  Activities
There are many advances  in knowledge  and technology  that will be of benefit  to New 
Zealand  farmers. However,  the cost of their development  would not allow individual  
farmers  to undertake  it on their own. Furthermore,  it would  be impossible  to protect  the 
results of the investment  to prevent  farmers  who hadn ’t paid for the developments  from 
using them on their farms. These  are called industry  good activities  and much of the 
farm production  research  and extension  are examples  of such activities.
The current  Dairy Board  Act required  the Dairy Board  to fund industry  good activities  on 
behalf of dairy farmers. The funds were sourced  directly  from revenue  from dairy  
product  sales and this meant  that dairy  farmers  were paying  for research  and extension  
although  the process  was not highly transparent.  In addition,  both government  and 
private sources  were providing  funding  in some  areas.
The dairy industry  is now working  with the New Zealand  government  to establish  a 
process  whereby  all milk that is produced  for sale will be subject  to a compulsory  levy. 
Funds collected  in this way will be used for industry  good activities  and the process  will 
be highly visible  to dairy farmers. In order to replace  current  levels of Dairy Board  
lunding  the levy would  have to be of the order  of 0.6% of a farm ’s income  from the sale 
ofmilksolids  or the equivalent  of approximately  three New Zealand  cents per kilogram  
ofmilksolids.
77
Productivity  of New Zealand  Dairy Farming
For some  years  the New Zealand  dairy industry  has been concerned  about  the declining  
annual cash surplus  position  of the average  dairy farm owner. The international  
competitiveness  of New Zealand  dairying  has also been threatened  by the performance  
of large USA dairying  feedlots,  especially  with the rapid uptake  of genetically  modified  
crops,  and by the potential  of grassland  dairying  in South  America.  The 1998 Strategic  
Plan confirmed  this position  by comparing  the productivity  of New Zealand  dairy farming  
with its counterparts  in various  parts of the world. In this context  the productivity  of a 
dairy farm is measured  as:
The annual  productivity  ratio is, of course,  heavily  affected  by three external  factors,  
namely  international  prices  of dairy products,  exchange  rates for the floating  NZ dollar 
(especially  relative  to the US dollar  which is the benchmark  currency  for traded  dairy 
products),  and seasonal  weather  conditions  for grassland  dairying.  However,  even with 
the external  effects  removed  by using  five-year  rolling  averages  for the average  owner-  
operator  dairy farm, the following  diagram  still displays  a decline  in productivity.
A detailed  econometric  analysis  of total factor productivity,  at an industry  level, is 
currently  undenway  in order to isolate  factors  associated  with the productivity  decline,  
but I am confident  that the three most important  factors  will be;
• the price that farmers  have been paying  and continue  to pay for land;
• the cost-price  squeeze  on margins  in internationally  traded  products;
• the increasing  farm costs in fertilisers  and supplementary  feeds that farmers  have 
been incurring  to feed cows of higher genetic  merit, relative  to the milksolids  
responses  to better  feeding.
• The challenge  for dairying  in New Zealand  is to arrest  this decline.
Creating  Dexcel
In June 2000 the New Zealand  Dairy Board announced  its decision  to establish  a 
Dairying  Centre  of Excellence  to improve  the competitiveness  and profitability  of New 
Zealand  dairy farmers.  A transition  board  and project  team steered  development  of the 
Dairying  Centre  of Excellence  until December  2000  when it was formally  established  in 
the form of a new organisation  called  Dexcel  Ltd. Dexcel  is operated  as a commerciaf  
trust and became  fully operational  on February  I®', 2001.
The name  ‘Dexcel ’ is derived  from the phrase  ‘dairying  centre  of excellence ’. This new 
organisation  is the industry ’s response  to the pending  deregulation  of the Dairy Board,  
the change  to a levy funding  system,  and to the declining  performance  of New Zealand  
dairy farming.  Incorporating  the former  Dairying  Research  Corporation  (DRC)  and the 
Consulting  Officer service of Livestock  Improvement  Corporation  (LIC), Dexcel  is 
accountable  for leading  the drive to improve  the competitive  position  of New Zealand  
dairy farmers,  and will play a pivotal  role in achieving  the dairy industry ’s 4% on-fartti  
productivity  improvement  target. It will achieve  this by combining  and enhancing  the 
considerable  capabilities  provided  by DRC science  and the Consulting  Officer  extension  
services  to co-ordinate  production  research  and development,  undertake  whole-farm  
systems  research  and ensure  the knowledge  gained  from that research  is taken up on 
farms.
78
Dexcel is also networking  with other  organisations  servicing  the dairy sector  to optimise  
whole farm systems,  and will work  with the Crown  to attract  Government  investment  into 
key industry  areas such as production  research  and vocational  training. Dexcel  
provides  a focused  voice for farm productivity,  and will enable  the dairy industry  to pull 
together and co-ordinate  all of the activities  related to on-farm research  and 
development.  Under the leadership  of Dexcel,  extension  anr;! farm research  and 
development  is now linked,  extension  is becoming  more targeted,  provision  is being  
made for industry  good research,  and the former  almost  exclusive  technology  focus  of 
research  and extension  is being broadened  to include  capability,  delivery  and change.  
Mpresent  Dexcel  employs  140 fulltime  staff and approximately  30 casual  workers.  One 
hundred  of the fulltime  staff work in research  related  areas  and 40 work in extension.  
For the dairy farming  sector,  Dexcel  plans  to achieve  the following:
Provide  technology  and knowledge  to increase  the productivity  of farming  systems  
and improve  annual  total productivity  by 4%.
Improve  sustainability  of dairying  through  the increased  use of farming  systems  which  
do not compromise  the environment  and the welfare  of dairy cattle.
Improve  human  resource  capability  for the dairy industry  through  the promotion  of 
dairy farming,  the development  of technological  and professional  capabilities  and the 
provision  of training  opportunities  for dairy farmers  and their staff.
The key activities  that will enable  Dexcel  to achieve  these  outcomes  include:  
Undertaking  whole farm systems  research  and linking this capability  to a strong  
internal  extension  group.
Commissioning  component  research  studies  from external  research  providers  by 
using its internal  research  capability  to engage  the external  sector.
Closely monitoring  the impacts  of research  and extension  on the productivity  of 
farming.
Strategies  for Increasing  Productivity
Ttie following  diagram  displays  the results  of a survey  on the productivity  profile  of about  
400 New Zealand  dairy farmers  for the 1999/2000  season. Roughly  half were owner-  
(perators  and half were 50/50 sharemilkers.  As depicted  in the diagram,  a larger  
proportion  of those  surveyed  need the impact  of customised  extension  strategy,  rather  
Ulan immediate  technology  advances,  to achieve  a productivity  improvement.  A 
lignilicant  component  of Dexcel's  extension  strategy  will be to use our small extension  
group to engage  the much larger private  sector of farm consultants,  veterinarians,  
tankers  and accountants  in activating  farmers  to analyse  their own farm businesses  and 
tie opportunities  for future  growth.
A second obvious,  but not new, observation  in relation  to achieving  sustainable  
productivity  gains is the positive  impact  of having  high quality  people  throughout  the 
ndustry or sector. Accordingly,  Dexcel  will put a high priority  on investing  in education  
and training  - from vocational  training  for employed  farm staff through  to attracting  the 
liighest quality undergraduates  and postgraduates  into studying  dairying  related  
dsciplines.
79
In New Zealand  one cannot  maintain  the right to practise  as a chartered  accountant  
without  investing  an annual  effort in personal  skill development  and training. Likewise  
in dairying,  issues  relating  to environmental  impacts  of dairying  and the safety  of dairy 
food products  along with the need to effectively  manage  their farm will require  farmers  
to continuously  lift the skill-set  in running  their business.
Concluding  Remarks
One of the outstanding  successes  in supporting  farming  in the previous  century  was  the 
US land grant  college  system.  In this system  each US state had a designated  university  
with responsibility  and capabilities  to undertake  agricultural  education,  research  and 
extension.  In these modern  times it will not be possible  for the New Zealand  dairy 
industry  to own and replicate  the land grant college  system  for dairying  education,  
research  and extension.  However,  with a small internal  capability  in farm systems  
research  and extension,  Dexcel  intends  to achieve  the success  of the land grant  college  
system  by managing  relationships  and networks  to encompass  the full range  of services  
that our industry  needs. We also believe  that by managing  networks,  as opposed  to 
owning  all the bricks, mortar  and capabilities  we will be able to rapidly  respond  to 
advances  in technology  and an ever-changing  set of demands  from a global food 
market.

Technology  transfer  in Ireland,  the present  and the future
EDDIE  MCQUINN
McQuinn  Consulting,  Farm Business  Consultants,  Tralee,  Co. Kerry 
Introduction
In my view, there is no area within  the Irish agricultural  industry  more neglected  than 
Snancial  management  at farm level. Over the past couple  of years  there has been a 
dramatic increase  in the demand  by more progressive  farmers  for information  and 
guidance on the subject. The use of IT (information  technology)  represents  an 
opportunity  to address  this issue  and help to improve  the efficiency  and competitiveness  
of farm businesses.  In the following  I propose  discussing  a few of the most important  
fciancial  management  tasks  in urgent  need of attention  on Irish farms  and where  current  
technology  could usefully  embraced.
The Past
From a financial  management  perspective,  the features  of Irish farming  could be 
summarized  as follows:  -
Relatively  small unit size where  making  a ‘living ’ was a priority;
Adequate  or surplus  labour  supply.  Automation  not a priority  and lack of capital  often  
a limiting  factor  to improvement;
Adequate  time available  to ‘think’, prior to decision  making;
Minimal  paper  work involved  in day to day running  of farm;
No suitable  cost effective  technology  available  with practical  application;
Managers  lacked  basic IT skills and failed to appreciate  the potential  contribution  IT 
could make  to their businesses.
Current  Trends  on Irish farms
Wiile there  are many  internal  and external  forces  influencing  and indeed  forcing  change  
in Irish agriculture,  at farm level the following  trends  are amongst  the more  obvious:  - 
Work force on farms  declining  and wage  costs  increasing;
Automation  an economic  necessity  for survival;
Farm managers  operate  within a fast moving  environment  with ready access  to 
information  in order  to help make  informed  decisions  quickly;
Bad decisions  are punished  more severely  and the consequences  are more  serious.  
(A 5% variation  in a large unit is much more serious  than a corresponding  variation  
in a small unit);
More paperwork  is now required  within the farm gate. Compliance  with various  
schemes  as well as the statutory  requirements  use scarce  resources  such as labour  
where  farm offices  are not computerized;
Increased  automation  being used by those institutions  interacting  with farming  on a 
regular  basis;
A more technically  skilled workforce  now exists on farms than here to fore. In 
addition,  access  to the necessary  skills is relatively  easy.
81
• Financial  margins  continue  to get slimmer  and strict financial  control has now 
become  vital for survival  and prosperity;
Technology  application  in financial  management  on Irish Farms  - one approach
Mission  Priorities  - apply  technology  that is: -
• The best available  at the least cost;
• Capable  of giving  the manager  enhanced  control  by converting  data into information.
• Make  information  available  to managers  that is: -
Accurate;
Timely;
Complete;
Relevant;
Easily  stored  for future  reference;
Easily  updated  when  combined  with additional  information  at a later date.
• Demand  on skills should  be within  the capacity  range  of managers;
• The operation  of the system  should  not impose  excessive  time demands.
• The system  should  be flexible  to a wide user range.
Building  blocks  of technology  on Irish farms  
Financial  and management  accounts
There is now an opportunity  to deploy  technology  in an area that is at the core of 
financial  management  on Irish farms.
Diagram  outlining  how this would  operate  is as follows:
Data is assembled  at farm level, electronically  transferred  to a central processor,  
processed  and the resultant  information  electronically  returned  to the original  source.
The essential  elements  of such a system  include:
Data Capture.  At farm level this may be through  keyboard,  scanner  or network.  It is 
likely that dairy co-ops, livestock  marts etc will soon be able to network  their 
customers/suppliers.  This will enable  sales data to be transferred  electronically  to 
producers  from where  it may be again  transferred  to the central  processor  without  input 
from the farm manager.  Input purchases  (cheque  payments)  for the farm may also be 
entered  into the computer  directly  at the time the purchase  is being made, avoiding
82
duplication  at a later stage.
The central  processor  W\\\ organise,  manipulate,  sort and calculate  data and transform  
it Into Information.  This will usually  be a dedicated  server  unit.
Data storage  may be through  discs,  CD-ROM,  tapes  etc. These  devices  will allow  data 
to be stored  and retrieved  at a later stage.
An output  medium  allows  information  to be communicated  back to the farm manager.  
The most convenient  methods  to display  output  are through  computer  screens,  printer, 
facsimile  machines  etc.
k control  system  operates  the entire information  technology  system. Simple  systems  
may use Windows,  DOS etc. and off the shelf  software.
Advantages  of system:  -
• Inexpensive.
• Provides  manager  with timely  information  including:  -
Year to date costs  and returns  (Profit)  versus  budgets;
Allows  managers  compare  the performance  of their businesses  with that 
of units in similar  circumstances;
Creditors  / Debtors;
Input usage  against  budget.
Cash Flow against  budget.
Calculated  Bank balances  against  actual.
• Allow managers  to make  informed  decisions  for their business.
• More time released  to managers  allowing  them  an opportunity  to address  the bigger  
issues  affecting  the business  including  cost control,  strategic  planning  etc.
• Provides  managers  with greater  control  of the business,  which  is an added  valuable  
resource.
• Allows  accountant/advisor  more time to interpret  information  and provide  informed  
analysis  of the business.
Electronic  Discussion  Group
On farm discussion  groups,  though  used in the past by only a minority  of farmers,  have  
experienced  a renaissance  in the recent past. They have proved  to be a valuable  
source of information,  support  and indeed  a social  outlet  for many  farmers.  However,  
they have limitations  and there are topics  and aspects  of the farm business  that many  
farmers  are reluctant  to discuss  openly. In addition  the small size of groups  limit the 
scope of new ideas,  opinions  etc.
An approach  that uses modern  technology  in order  to make  relevant  Information  readily  
and cheaply  available  to farm managers  is the use of the Intranet.  This is similar  to the 
Internet  but operates  within  the confines  of a single  organization.  This approach  could  
be coordinated  by a firm of agricultural  consultants  who would also provide a 
professional  input. Individual  users would be given a unique  password,  may log on
83
anonymously  and e-mail  their query. Other  managers  may then offer their opinions  as 
well as a professional  opinion  from the coordinators.
Advantages  of such a system;  -
• No  limit on the number  of users.
• Provides  unlimited  geographic  spread  for participants.
• May  be used at managers  discretion  i.e. they use it at a time that is convenient to 
them.
• Inexpensive  to use.
• Provides  rapid access  to information.
• Allows  sensitive  topics  to be discussed  in confidence.
Typical  discussion  topics  might  include  bank charges,  input  costs,  technical  queries etc.
Conclusions:
• The financial  management  skills of farm managers  need to be addressed.
• Information  needs to be made available  that is timely, relevant,  complete  and 
accurate.  (Software  is now available  to address  these  issues).
• IT helps  to improve  business  efficiency  thus leading  to increased  profitability  and all 
that goes with it.
• Managers  must take more control  of their businesses.
• Managers  must make more time for ‘thinking ’, for strategic  planning,  for family,  
lifestyle  etc,
• Farming  has become  a solitary existence  and managers  need support  and 
assurance  as well opinions  from peer groups.
Electronic  Discussion  Groups  can now keep individual  managers  in touch with like- 
minded  people as well as their professional  advisers. Sensitive  matters  may be 
discussed  in confidence.  Geographic  location  is no longer  a barrier.

DAVID  HANNON  
Derrypatrick,  Drumree,  Co Meath
Introduction
My approach  to farming  is to run the farm as a business.  This approach  is based  on the 
underiying  fact mat milk price does not keep up with inflation  yet inputs  do, and so to 
prosper  the farm needs  to be run efficiently  to get the most out of it (see Table 1).
Table 1. The pattern  of milk price compared  with inflation  in last 15 years

Family Farm Details
Married  to Catherine  and we have five children.
133 adjusted  acres  owned  
43 adjusted  acres rented  
Soil type - heavy  
137 cows
150,000  gallons  of milk quota  
50 replacement  units
1 and a half labour  units (including  myself)
In 1995 we took over the farm. The 1=' farm plan was based  mainly  at reducing  debts.  
This was achieved  by:-
Setting  out of beef  in 1996. As a result turnover  dropped  but not the profit. Profit is 
more important  than turnover.
Selling the silage outfit. Expenditure  on the farm during  this period  was mainly  on 
infrastructure  (roadways,  provision  of water,  fencing,  etc.).
In 2000 the 2"^ farm plan widened  to include  3 goals:-  
Grow  our net worth;
Be able to retire at 55 if we wish;
Have a comfortable  lifestyle;
Running  an efficient  and simple  farm system  can achieve  these  goals. For the purpose  
of this paper, I will be focusing  on the 1®' goal, growing  our net worth. This is achieved  
through  the following:-
85
1. Simple  System
The system  is based  on a compact  spring-calving  herd with grazed  grass  contributing
the greater  part of the diet. The aim is to have a system  that can be run by one person  
at all times. Targets  needed  to achieve  this are 100%  of cows  calved  in 10 weeks  and 
95% submission  rate in first 3 weeks  of the breeding  season.  Cows  go to grass  about  
mid-February  by day and full time in early March  (2001 was the exception  when it was 
nearly  April due to lack of grass). The number  of paddocks  closed  for silage  is flexible  
and depends  on grass  growth  and level of grass  cover  at these  times.
Good handling  facilities  enables  one-person  to keep the place under control. In the 
collecting  yard we have a backing  gate with a scraper  that allows  cows to be directed  
into the parlour  without  the need to leave  the pit (it also scrapes  the yard!). For Al, hoof 
pairing  etc. cows can be diverted  using a diverting  gate as the cows leave the parlor.  
The out farm is laid out with its own handling  facilities,  central  roadway  and fencing  to 
allow easy movement  of animals  by one person.  All of these save time and make  the 
movement  of animals  safe and efficient.
2. Cost  control/high  product  price
An important  part of achieving  this is being a member  of both a discussion  and 
purchasing  group. The discussion  group  allows  us to throw  ideas  around  and compare  
our costs  with top farmers.  We can discuss  topics  of importance  at specific  times,  e g. 
Al and heat detection  around  April, grass  management  during  the summer  period,  etc. 
We also organise  speakers  to talk to us on banking,  shares,  insurance  etc. The 
information  and timing  of information  can be invaluable.
The purchasing  group  helps  to get good value  for money. Target  costs  are at less than 
40% of Gross  Farm Income  and all costs  are looked  at. We also believe  in getting  the 
top price you can for your product,  which is equally  as important  so we aim for high 
quality  milk with high protein  levels.
3. Time Management
We try to work smart  and not hard. With a little planning  and organisation  we have time 
for ourselves,  the kids, planning,  work and other investments.  A lot of time can be 
wasted  collecting  meal, going  to the hardware  store. Often delivery  charges  are small  
or non existent,  and by phoning  around  we can find where  the best value is and get it 
delivered.  We use FRS for peak times,  days off and holidays.
Planning  and Target  Setting
Planning  and target setting  is probably  the most important  part of any business  but 
cannot  be achieved  without  devoting  time. There  are two types  of planning;  short-term
- day-to-day  target  setting,  which  are achieved  by (a) budgeting  (e g. daily feed targets  
like grass, meal etc. and fortnightly  financial  commitments),  and (b) good record  
keeping.  This involves  meeting  seasonal  targets  such as cow submission  rates, SCC 
levels,  monthly  milk protein  levels  etc. The second  type of planning  is for the long term
- this is back to the farm plan and where  we want to be long after the five year plan is
86
over (i.e. goals) but this will change  as our needs  and circumstances  change. With 
good financial  planning  we know  where  we are and where  we are going. This allows  us 
to use our resources  to their best potential  and have enough  money  to live and pay the 
bills. Expand,  Prosper  and Invest
We make money,  what do we do with it?
1. Farming
With quotas,  expansion  can be slow, but there  are other  resources  on the farm.  
Cottage:  - This we intend  to develop.
Shed: - These  could be let.
Human  Resources:  - People  are the back bone of anything.  We have skills and talents  
that can be used.
2. Non-Farming
Short  Term  - After peak supply  is reached,  surplus  money  becomes  available  from milk 
sales. In many  cases,  this money  is left untouched  but not utilised  efficiently.  Surplus  
money  e g. money  to pay bills and live through  the quite times  of the year often is not 
utilised. With good budgeting  we can remove  surplus  money  from the current  account  
and put it on deposit  and get over 4% interest;  e.g. £10,000  for 6 months  =£200. If this 
was £30,000  for 6 months  = £600. This could provide  for a few days away.
Long Term - pensions,  shares  and property
A pension  has 2 advantages,  it gives us security  and freedom  to retire and do what we 
want with our other assets. The other reason  is it is allowable  against  tax and so is a 
good investment  particularly  since  the rules on pensions  have changed.

From Table  2 it is obvious  that shares  and property  are better  investments  than dairying  
especially  in recent  times. One of our first investments  on the stock market  was the 
money  from the sale of some of the silage  equipment.  We sought  advice  and this was 
invested  in the Irish Stock Market. In the first 2 months,  it made 50% then fell, then 
came back. It is volatile  but if we invest  in good companies  with a good track record  
over a long period  of time we should  do well. Since  then we have learned  more  of what
87
to look for in selecting  shares  to invest  in. Completed  a course  in investment  principles  
has helped  us in this regard.
Last winter  when  the cows  were dried off I went  to work in a shop  to learn  the business.  
It was a great experience.  We believe  that if we are going to invest  in something  we 
need to research  and know  the business,  also we will pay for professional  advice where  
needed.
Conclusion
Farming  is and will continue  to be the backbone  of our business.  The business  is 
efficient,  but due to lack of opportunities  in agriculture  outside  investments  are attractive  
(assuming  we invest long term). We will continue  investing  outside  agriculture  until 
opportunities  arise in agriculture,  which  will give us a good return  on our investment.

Plan and key points  to successfully  growing  your business
COLIN  ARMER  
Tepuke,  New Zealand
New Zealand  (NZ). Famous  for lamb, butter, beer and the All Blacks. Unconstrained  
by quotas,  and unprotected  by subsidies,  dairy farmers  live and die on their ability  to 
make a profit on the world market In 2000 NZ had more than 14,000  dairy farmers  
working  an average  90 ha (222 ac) of land. On these  90 ha the farmer  produced  some  
60 tonnes  of milk solids  from 230 cows. A temperate  climate  facilitates  grazing  cows  all 
year round, with the cows being dried off during the winter. Milk goes to The Co­
operative  dairy company  (of which  the farmer  is a shareholder)  and 95 per cent of this 
milk is processed  for export. That  was farming  in NZ. Today  we are looking  at the new 
face of farming.
New Zealand  farmers  of the future will become  even more efficient  at producing  milk 
solids. Ifs something  we do very well. In less than 23 years my wife Dale and I have  
moved from farm labourers,  to share milkers  running  150 cows, to farm investors  
owning  and running  11 farms. Today  we own 10,000  cows in NZs North Island. Ten 
years from now our colleagues  will be those  that made  farming  their business,  and grew  
that business  to capitalise  on the economies  of scale. The rest will have sold up and 
moved  to the security  of the cities - there's  no room for complacency  in today ’s dairy  
industry.
What is the key to success?  There ’s no secret  formula.  Ifs all a matter  of profit. We 
took under-performing  farms and turned them into cash cows. Once that farm is 
established  and generating  money  we move  on to the next farm. Ifs a system  that once  
set in motion  generates  its own momentum.  We see dairy farming  as a simple  process.  
Grow as much  grass  as possible  turning  most  of it into milk, all the time keeping  
a close  eye on costs  and the balance  sheet.
Growing  grass
Grass is the great renewable  resource.  Farming  is all about  growing  grass,  yet many  
farmers  consistently  fail to maximise  production  of this resource.  Growing  grass  is one 
of the simplest  ways  to grow productivity,  and using fertiliser  is the key. In fact ifs one 
of the few things  that NZ farmers  will spend  money  on. We soil test on a yearly  basis  
and develop  a short-term  fertilising  strategy  to optimise  the soil’s nutrient  levels. Land 
is contoured,  drained  and reseeded  to support  intensive  grazing  as needed.  The aim is 
to turn as much sunshine  as possible  into grass. This means  removing  any limiting  
steps such as nutrient  deficiency,  unsuitable  grass  types,  or waterlogged  land. Delays  
in applying  fertiliser  simply  delay the production  response,  and therefore  the farm ’s 
profitability.  Every  additional  tonne  of grass  that is grown  can be turned  into 57 kg of 
milk solids. Growing  grass  creates  the potential  to grow your business.
Growing  cows
To efficiently  turn grass into milk we need a cost-effective  animal management  
programme.  This means  reducing  animal  wastage  and maximising  herd growth. In NZ
89
(as in Ireland),  fertility  problems  are associated  with U.S. Holstein  Friesian  genetics.  
However,  by using  semen  from NZ Jersey  bulls and a cross  breeding  programme,  95 % 
of cows  go in calf every  year. Using  bulls from a sire-proving  scheme  ensures  value  for 
money. By retaining  as many  cows  as possible  and achieving  high pregnancy  rates, NZ 
farmers  are constantly  growing  their demand  for grass.
Growing  productivity
Stocking  the land is the next step. Put simply  cows add value  to grass  by turning  it into 
milk. In NZ it is possible  to grow about 14 t of grass  for every hectare  of land. Most 
farmers  are content  to use 75 % of their annual  grass production,  but by carefully 
stocking  our farms it is possible  to get cows to eat 85 % of the grass produced.  By 
maximising  grass production  and then getting  cows to utilise  as much  of that grass  as 
possible,  annual  income  can be significant  increased.
For example:  - take a farmer  growing  12 t grass/ha.  The farmer  is content  to use 75 % 
of this grass,  which  equates  to 9 t of grass. His cows  turn each tonne  of grass  they eat 
into 67 kg of milk solids making  600 kg of milk solids in total. At IR£1.50/kg  this 
represents  a gross profit of IR£900/ha/yr.  Alternatively,  by optimising  soil fertility  and 
grass  type the same  land is now capable  of producing  14 t of grass,  of which  the cows 
eat 85 % or about 12 t/ha/yr. From this the cows produce  800 t of milk solids  worth 
IR£1,200  - nearly 35% more income. By efficiently  managing  our pastures,  and 
matching  annual  growth  to consumption,  we don’t need  to buy in expensive  feeds. This 
contrasts  with many farmers  who write out cheques  for winter  feed while their grass 
goes to waste.
Growing  debt
It can be argued  that this comes  at a capital  cost. However  it makes  economic  sense 
to borrow  the money  up front so it can be immediately  used to improve  the fertility  of 
your property,  rather  than relying  on an under-performing  farm to progressively  fund a 
series  of five-year  improvement  plans. It didn't  work for Chairman  Mao, and it doesn ’t 
work  for farmers.  Add into this equation  the simple  fact that cows  appreciate  in value  - 
they spit out a new calf every year - and you will see that higher  stock rates mean a 
faster growth  in livestock  assets. The key to growing  your business  is to do it with 
somebody  else’s money. I’m a strong  believer  in debt. I don’t believe  in sinking  vast 
reserves  of my own capital  into a farm. A well-run  farm will generate  enough  money  to 
service a mortgage,  make capital repayments  plus provide  a surplus  for further  
expansion.  High gearing  facilitates  the establishment  of a farm with minimal  direct  
investment,  which  quickly  begins  to generate  additional  capital  for further  expansion.  
Farms  are converted  using as much of the bank’ s money  as possible,  and as little as 
possible  personal  cash. This is achieved  by using our own cows to stock new farms.  
Typically  such cows  represent  three  quarters  of the assets  brought  to a new venture,  the 
other  quarter  being  cash spent  on capital  improvements  to get the grass  growing.  This 
means  the 70 % loan from the banks  (the maximum  amount  on offer in NZ) often equals  
the original  cost price of the farm, or in other words  a 100 % gearing  on land and 
building  costs.
90
Growing  a business
So much  for the theory. How do we apply  these  principles  to growing  the business?  In 
June 2000 I borrowed  IRE1.3  million  to buy a 275 ha farm in NZ, and introduced  new 
management  and staff  that understood  our production  techniques  and followed  our cost-  
control  measures.  We applied  appropriate  levels  of fertiliser,  and stocked  the farm using 
1,000 cows,  which  were raised  surplus  to our other  operations.  By growing  more grass  
and increasing  utilization,  we increased  pre-conversion  production  by 40 %. This shift 
in production  increased  the capital  value of the farm to IRE1.9  million. Thus within  a 
year we had created  a farm with a total value including  livestock  of IRE2.2  million. To 
do this we had borrowed  IRE1.3  million,  added  1,000  cows which  were surplus  to our 
other holdings,  and invested  personal  money  to improve  the soil and sward. The return  
on this operation  pays all costs, all interest  payments,  repayment  of the debt, plus it 
generates  enough  additional  capital  to fund future  expansion.  What ’s more the cows  
are producing  calves,  which  can stock  future  farm purchases.
Some may argue that we’re building  a house of cards. That our high gearing  is a 
formula  for failure. The important  point is that every one of our farms  is a viable  unit. 
Each farm is servicing  its debt and generating  additional  revenue  which  we use to grow  
our business.  We are not funding  our expansion  by relying  on potential  revenues.  
Rather  we’re converting  farms into highly-productive  units which are generating  real 
profits. We then use these profits  to grow our business.  The reason  why we continue  
investing  in new farms  is that NZ still offers  considerable  scope  to generate  spectacular  
profits by converting  both sheep,  beef, and under-performing  dairy farms into highly-  
productive  dairy units. While  these  opportunities  for expansion  might  not be so evident  
in Ireland,  I believe  our farming  philosophy  can still be applied  to generate  considerable  
revenue  from your farms,  which can then be applied  to expand  your other business  
interests.
Keeping  a tight reign on debt
While I’ve said that we love debt, we are very careful  where  we spend  our money. In 
fact tight financial  control  is a cornerstone  of profit  making.  I believe  in spending  money  
where  it’s going  to make  money. Where  there is a need for capital  investment  I look to 
the cheapest option  for getting  the job done. In a recent  farm conversion  we had to build  
a new farm dairy. By opting  for an open-sided  dairy we managed  to keep costs  down  
to IRE45,000.  A conventional  farmer  may well have spent  IRE1 80,000  building  a Rolls  
Royce  dairy. Our dairy is doing  the same  job at a quarter  of the price, but in contrast  to 
the conventional  farmer  there is still IRE1 35,000  in the kitty to grow  the business.
Farm implements  are another  area waiting  to consume  capital. Agents  are always  
willing to peddle  the latest machinery  guaranteed  to improve  productivity  - impressive  
monuments  of painted  metal and stainless  steel. Let somebody  else own it. Every 
dollar spend  on machinery  is a dollar  less to improve  productivity.  Remember  a simple  
phone  call is enough  to get a contractor  beating  a path to your door. The more money  
invested in farm machinery,  the higher the running costs and the greater the 
depreciation  and maintenance  costs. Our adage  is - 'if it works,  use it; If it doesn ’t 
hire it; if you can’t hire it buy the cheapest  option ’. Put simply:  less four-wheeled  
vehicles,  more  four-legged  animals.
91
Animal  health  is another  area, which  can soak up profits. While  we’re all in favour  of 
maintaining  a healthy herd, this does not mean applying  every last medical  
breakthrough  to your cows. Carefully  assess  new animal  husbandry  practices,  and 
select  only those  that add significant  value  to the herd.
Looking  beyond  the farm
Carefully  scrutinising  capital  outlay is an obvious  way to control  costs, but it is also 
prudent  to look beyond  traditional  farming  practices  to seek new ways of growing  the 
business.  The corporate  world provides  plenty  of examples,  and in the corporate  world  
the mantra  is to concentrate  on your core business.  Growing  grass  and getting  cows to 
turn that grass  into milk solids  is our core business.  We want to make  this process  as 
efficient  as possible.  We don’t want  to waste  our quality  pastures  raising  calves.  Calves  
don’t turn grass  into milk. That ’s not to say that we don’t like calves.  As was said earlier 
cows  are a great  investment  because  they appreciate  in value. In fact 95 % of our cows  
calf every  year, but then we want to get our calves  off our farms  as quick as possible.  
To do this we wean  them early and feed them on pellets  and straw  on a centralised  calf 
farm. This system  is a labour-efficient  means  of rearing  new livestock  and saves our 
pastures  for milk production.  One full-time  worker  with occasional  casual  labour  raises  
2000 young calves  each year. As the animals  grow they are moved  onto one of 12 
leased  farms  that used to run sheep  and beef.
Leasing  ex-sheep  farms  is an inexpensive  means  of building  grazing  capacity.  Leasing  
land is not only cheaper  than paying  a grazing  fee to other farmers,  it also facilitates 
control  over how our calves  and heifers  are raised. This land is perfectly  adequate  to 
raise calves,  which means  we don’t have to take our premium  pastures  out of milk 
production.  Remember  our core business  is turning  grass  into milk. Currently  we 
are using  calf-rearing  sheds  and leased  farms  to raise  5,000  calves.  This highly  efficient  
and cost-effective  way of raising  new herds produces  assets,  which  feed into our farm 
expansion  programme.
Controlling  labour  costs
Our calf-rearing  programme  is but one example  of how we control  labour  costs, with 
economies  of scale providing  many more opportunities.  Applying  innovative  growing  
techniques  and hiring rather  than buying  specialist  machinery,  means  our farms use 
minimum  labour. Efficient  grass  utilisation  is the best way to reduce  labour  costs. It is 
cheaper  to hire a contractor  to fertilise  land than to pay staff to run an intensive 
supplementary  feed programme.  Labour,  like all other costs, must  justify  its expense. 
Therefore  it is expected  that all of the people  employed  add value  to our operations.  
Currently  we employ  65 people. Keeping  staff motivated  means  offering  clear job 
descriptions  and channels  for advancement.  A simple  and clear management  structure 
is also important  to aid the flow of communication  and clearly  define  who is responsible 
for accomplishing  each task. If possible  staff are encouraged  to purchase  a few cows  
on a lease  arrangement.  Providing  staff with a stake holding  in operations  can prove  a 
powerful  motivator.  Encouraging  staff to undertake  adult education  programmes  is 
another  way to add value  to their  work. This applies  equally  to management  - both Dale
92
and I continually  question  how we operate  and are continually  seeking  new solutions.  
We have found inspiration  from innovative  thinkers,  both in farming  and from other  
sectors  of industry.  This does  not mean  paying  for costly  consultants,  but rather  trusting  
our own curiosity  and judgement  to select  those procedures  likely to add significant  
value to our operations.  The only area where  we do pay for specialist  advice  is on legal 
and accounting  matters  to ensure  our operations  comply  with our legal obligations  and 
operate  in a tax-efficient  manner.
Key steps  to controlling  costs:
• Question  money  spent  on animal  health,  breeding  and herd testing. Don’t let your 
heart rule your head, apply simple  cost-benefit  criteria  every  time money  is spend  
on the herd.
• Question  the money spent on capital improvements  - don’t compete  with the 
neighbour  for the most attractive  farm, compete  where  it counts,  on making  money.
• Control  labour  costs  - look for economies  of scale, and reward  staff for a job well 
done, not for complacency.
• Look for alternatives  - treat farming  like any other  business,  it should  be continually  
improved,  standing  still means  you’re going  backwards.
• Seek expert  advice  - consider  yourself  an expert  on turning  grass into milk, and 
seek advice  from others  to fill in the necessary  knowledge  gaps.
Investment  criteria
Investing  in production  while  controlling  other  costs  has proven  a successful  formula  to 
fund expansion.  However,  moving  from being farmer to a farm investor  means  
developing  a strategy  to manage  growth. Three years ago we set ourselves  an 
investment  strategy  to manage  our cashflow,  plus most importantly  the allocation  of our 
time. The merits  of each new project  were  judged  on three criteria:
• Minimum  13 per cent return.
• Positive  effect  on equity.
• The project  will consume  one day’s work per week for the first year, then one 
day per month  thereafter.
As operations  have grown  we have refined  these  criteria  to:
• Minimum  13 per cent return.
• Very positive  effect  on equity.
• The project  will consume  half a day’s work per month  for the first year, then 
one hour per month  thereafter.
It is anticipated  that in three years, our time available  to manage  investments  will 
become  even more limited. I don’t believe  in expanding  operations  at the expense  of 
free time. Careful  time management  is very important  for the successful  expansion  of 
our partnership,  and the Internet  is a powerful  tool to manage  our holdings.
93
To meet our investment  strategy  we had to select  farms  ripe for conversion.  Often  this 
meant looking  beyond  traditional  dairying  areas. Marginal  land often provides  the 
greatest  potential  for positive  shifts in equity. We have a proven  history  of converting 
peat land to highly  productive  pastures.  Recently  we looked  at 1000 ha of high-country  
land that was running  sheep. The land was primarily  flat with high summer  rainfall,  but 
suffered  from severe  winters,  poor soil fertility  and no ryegrasses.  These  factors  meant  
it was not considered  suitable  for dairy  farming.  In fact the nearest  dairy  farm was some  
70 km away. While  we couldn ’t control  the weather,  we were confident  that reseeding 
and fertiliser  would  produce  quality  pastures.  We could  then deal with winter  grazing  by 
leasing  sheep  farms  near  the coast. Add this to the lack of competitive  interest  by other  
dairy farmers,  and this land was ripe for conversion.  We saw it as marginal  land that 
could be converted  into quality  pastures
Unfortunately  our bank manager  didn ’t share  our vision. One of his Wellingtons  is still 
standing  in the paddock.  He left it behind  in his haste  to walk away from the venture.  
We haven ’t bothered  returning  it - in fact we haven ’t seen  him since. We simply  selected  
a bank that was willing  to share  our vision. The property  was bought  and converted  
using our proven  business  system. Within  six years we tripled  production  with 3500 
cows  annually  producing  one million  kg of milk solids. High productivity  has resulted  in 
a high shift in equity  as the land is now valued  as a productive  dairy farm, and not as a 
low-return  sheep  unit.
In 23 years  we have moved  from farm labourers  to farm investors.  By applying  a low- 
cost high-profit  approach  to farming  we have progressively  brought  11 farms in NZ 
central  North Island  and run some 10000  cows. The capital  value of these  operations  
is IR£22  million.Picking  winners
The power  to expand
The profits  generated  from our 11 dairy  farms  have recently  provided  us with the capital  
resources  to enter  a new phase  of expansion.  In partnership  with three  others  we have 
recently  brought  33 farms in NZ’s South Island. The area, known  as Canterbury,  is 
experiencing  a financial  boom as progressive  investors  begin converting  sheep and 
beef land into highly productive  dairy farms. Our company  (Dairy Farm Holdings)  
manages  some 25000  cows producing  some nine million  kg of milk solids  each year. 
Productivity  will rise and costs  will fall as we apply our farming  methods  to grow ample  
grass,  and then turn as much  of that grass  as possible  into milk solids.
Our eye for a good investment  is now looking  beyond  NZ. Using  the same  partnership  
we have just secured  a 50 per cent stake in a group of Australian  farms. Tasman  
Agriculture  is a listed public  company  trading  on NZ’s stock exchange.  The company  
owns  and operates  a number  of farms  in Australia  running  15000  dairy cows  along  with 
sheep  and beef We are more  than confident  that our conversion  programme  will see 
the production  of high-quality  grass, which will support  pure dairy farming. In 
combination  these holdings  represent  an IR£85  million  investment  in the future  of the 
world  dairy industry.
94
What set the platform  for this exponential  growth?  It’s all built upon growing  as much 
grass as we can, then turning  as much of that grass  as possible  into milk, all the time 
keeping  a close  eye on costs. All we are doing is applying  the KIS principle  to farming  
-Keep  It Simple. It works! A well-run  dairy farm will generate  considerable  profit for 
ploughing  back into expanding  the farm holdings.  We have done  this because  we see 
considerable  potential  for gains  in New Zealand  and Australia.  However,  the profits  can 
be equallyGetting  it right

Leptospirosis  in dairy cows  - what  are the solutions?
N. LEONARD
Department  of Veterinary  Microbiology  and Parasitology,  Faculty  of Veterinary  
Medicine,  UCD, Dublin  4
Introduction
Leptospires  are thin, helical  bacteria  which  survive  well in moist  conditions.  There  are 
many species  of leptospires,  many of which do not cause disease. Pathogenic 
leptospires  persist  in the kidneys  of their natural  hosts  and may be excreted  in urine for 
months  or years. In Ireland,  the cow is the natural  host for two species  of leptospires,  
Leptospira  interrogans  serovar  hardjo  and Leptospira  borgpetersenii  serovar  hardjo.  
Both organisms  are similar  in their effects  and most diagnostic  tests do not distinguish 
between  them. Genetic  fingerprinting  can differentiate  them  but this is usually  done only 
in research  laboratories.  There  is evidence  that L. interrogans  serovar  hardjo  may be 
more pathogenic  than L. borgpetersenii  serovar  hardjo  but the latter is more widely  
distributed  throughout  the dairy cow population.  The principal  relevance  of this is in 
relation  to vaccine  manufacture.
The effects  of leptospiral  infection
Infection  with serovar  hardjo  is widespread  in Irish dairy cows. A recent  survey  of dairy 
herds using a bulk milk tank ELISA  test showed  that 79% of unvaccinated  herds  
contained  animals,  which  had acquired  infection  within  the previous  12 months  (Leonard  
et al., 2001). Larger  herds  were more likely to be positive  for infection  (Figure  1).

Clinical  effects  in cattle
Tfie effects  of leptospirosis  in a dairy herd can be dramatic  if it is introduced  into a 
previously  uninfected  herd with a high percentage  of animals  aborting.  Animals  may 
also show milk drop syndrome  in which  there is sudden  loss of milk production,  usually  
affecting  all four quarters.  The udder  is soft and flabby  and the milk is thickened  like 
rolostrum.  Return  to normal  milk production  within  about  14 days is usual. Diagnosis  
of leptospiral  disease  in Irish regional  veterinary  laboratories  is usually  based on 
tetection  of high antibody  titres in serum  and reports  from the laboratories  indicate  that 
liigh titres are detected  regularly  following  investigation  of abortions.  However,  as the 
lesults of the survey  by Leonard  et al. (2001)  show, leptospiral  infection  is now endemic  
(I most Irish dairy herds  and thus few animals  show clinical  signs of disease  because  
Host animals  in the herd are immune.  Animals  most likely to show clinical  signs are 
liose newly introduced  to the herd such as replacement  heifers,  which have had no 
previous  contact  with the main herd or bought-in  animals.  Bennett  (1993)  calculated  the 
tosts of endemic  infection  with leptospirosis  at between  £1,300  and £3,300  Stg in a 100 
aw herd. Losses  can be attributed  mainly  to loss of milk production,  abortions  and 
leduced herd fertility. Dhaliwal  et al. (1996a,b)  showed  that herd fertility  is reduced  in 
terds in which cows have recently  acquired  infection  with serovar  hardjo  and that 
Bccination  may be beneficial  in improving  fertility  in infected  herds.
Cfn/ca/  effects  in humans
liaddition  to losses  due to animal  disease,  leptospirosis  can affect  humans.  Humans  
an acquire  leptospirosis  from contact  with urine of infected  animals.  The most serious  
torn of leptospirosis  is carried  by rats and causes  Weil’s disease  in people. However, 
serovar hardjo  can also infect humans  and causes  influenza-like  symptoms.  A recent  
paper by Pate et al. (2000)  stated  that the mean number  of hospital-reported  cases  of 
iptospirosis  in Ireland  was 4.9 per million per annum  during the years 1990-1996,  
ihich is approximately  5 times higher  than the incidence  in England. The highest  
icidence  of disease  was in the South-Eastern  Health  Board  at 10.4 cases  per million  
er annum, almost one third of which were due to serovar  hardjo. A significant  
ssociation  with numbers  of cattle and annual  incidence  of leptospirosis  was detected  
nd increased  uptake  of cattle vaccination  was suggested  as a possible  means  of 
(ducing  the number  of human  cases  of disease.
cptospirosis  in dairy cows  - the solutions
iDumber  of options  are available  for coping  with leptospirosis  in a dairy herd:
TO with infection
lie first option  is to live with the infection  and implement  no control  measures.  Most  
(rds are endemically  infected  with leptospirosis  and thus a high proportion  of animals  
iltie herd are immune  and it can be expected  than only a small percentage  of animals  
I show signs of disease. It has been estimated  that the abortion  rate due to 
ptospirosis  in endemically  infected  herd’s ranges  between  3% and 5%. However,  the
97
abortion  rate may be less in some  herds  and prediction  of effects  is difficult  due to a lad 
of data and apparent  variation  in pathogenicity  between  strains  of hardjo. Equally,  as, s 
immunity  in a herd wanes,  mini-outbreaks  of disease  are possible  and abortion  rata 
may rise above 5%. The risk of human  infection  in endemically  infected  herds!  
relatively  low as only a small proportion  of animals  are actively  infected  and sheddii , 
leptospires  in urine. However,  health and safety regulations  mean that such risb 
cannot  be dismissed  and employers  must  act responsibly  in relation  to the health  offam 
workers.
Vaccination
There are a number  of vaccines  on the market  in Ireland. All are killed vaccins  
although  there are differences  in formulation  between  them. Not all vaccines  conta 
the same  strains  of serovar  hardjo  but unfortunately  no comparative  data are availai  
on the performance  of the vaccines  currently  available  in Ireland.  All vaccines  requi« 
a primary  course  of two injections  2 to 6 weeks  apart;  the interval  between  doses  varia 
depending  on the product  used. Booster  vaccination  is carried  out annually.  Tlie 
recommendation  is that vaccination  should  be completed  in the spring,  before  the mail 
season  of transmission  of serovar  hardjo  infection.  As there is some evidence  
vaccination  may have a transient  effect on conception  rates, it is recommended 
vaccination  be completed  two weeks  before  the beginning  of the breeding  season!  
spring-calving  herds.
Treatment  with antibiotics  
Antibiotic  treatment  can be used as a tool in the control  of leptospirosis,  principally  f 
the elimination  of shedding  of leptospires  in urine  but also to minimise  abortions  in herd 
experiencing  outbreaks  of infection.  Treatment  of pregnant  animals  with antibiotid  
helps  to prevent  damage  to the placenta  and subsequent  abortion  in infected  animal  
Dihydrostreptomycin  at a dose rate of 25 mg/kg  is the antibiotic  usually  recommend  
for treatment  but amoxycillin  at 15 mg/kg may be a useful alternative  (Smith  efalj 
1997).
Control  regimes
The pattern  of infection  in a herd can be established  by blood sampling  and testingd  
appropriate  numbers  of animals  in conjunction  with the herd veterinary  surgeon.  Abtl 
milk tank ELISA  test is also now available  and can be a useful initial screening  test 
Once  the extent  of infection  in a herd is known,  the most  appropriate  control  regime  ca 
be selected.  Detailed  guidelines  on methods  for the control  of leptospirosis  have bea 
published  (Anon,  1992). Vaccination  does not prevent  previously  infected  animals  fron 
shedding  of leptospires  in urine.
Whole  herd vaccination  with annual  boosters  in the spring is a commonly  employe  
control method  in endemically  infected  herds. Provided  no major risk factors  ar 
present  such as frequent  introduction  of animals  into the herd, annual  vaccinatio  
should  be adequate.  Vaccination  of replacement  animals  should  be started  at 6 moniti  
of age. It is important  to include  bulls in a vaccination  control  programme  as the
98
jctively  transmit  infection.  Bulls or other animals  introduced  to the herd should  be 
ited with dihydrostreptomycin,  vaccinated  and held in isolation  for approximately  a 
;k before  introduction  to the herd. (A quarantine  period  of a number  of weeks  may 
required  for the control  of diseases  other  than leptospirosis).
lartial herd vaccination  appears  to give adequate  protection  in herds  in which  no major  
iiical signs  of leptospirosis  are detectable,  although  in theory,  outbreaks  of disease  in 
Her animals  are possible.  This option  involves  vaccination  of replacement  stock  at 6, 
*^and 30 months  of age. Bulls should be treated  as detailed  under whole herd 
accination.
bccination  can be combined  with antibiotic  treatment  in herds  in which  many  animals  
ave been clinically  affected  with leptospirosis,  or if elimination  of urinary  shedding  is 
iquired to reduce  the risk of human infection. Antibiotic  treatment  of a herd, in 
mbination  with simultaneous  vaccination  of at least all cows in the second  half of 
isgnancy  is effective  in reducing  losses  in the face of an abortion  storm. As the dose  
lie for dihydrostreptomycin  requires  milk to be disc^arded  for at least 7 days, it may be 
Bfe economical  in some herds to delay treatment  until drying off. For logistical  
Bsons,  this is most  feasible  in herds  with short  calving  periods  as treated  animals  must  
(kept separately  from untreated  animals  for as long as possible  until all shedding  in 
line has ceased.
sdication  of infection  in a herd
is possible  to eradicate  leptospiral  infection  from a herd and a scheme  under  which  
erds may achieve  leptospiral  ‘elite ’ status  has operated  in the UK. Herds,  which  show  
nlyafew  animals  serologically  positive  at a low level on herd screening,  could  attempt  
eliminate  infection  from the herd. This can be achieved  by treating  all positive  
jmals with antibiotic,  retesting  to establish  that the animals  have become  serologically  
(gative and using regular  serological  monitoring  to ensure  all animals  in the herd 
main serologically  negative.  All additions  to the herd must be serologically  negative.  
Bated with antibiotic  and held in isolation  before  joining  the main group of animats,  
introl of other known  risk factors  such as access  to rivers or co-grazing  with sheep  
mst also be possible. An individual  herd-owner  and his veterinary  surgeon  must  
isess the practicality  and economic  implications  of achieving  and maintaining  herd 
iection-free  status.

Salmonellosis  in cattle  - your  questions  answered
J. F. MEE
Teagasc,  Dairy Production  Department,  Moorepark  Production  Research  Centre,
Fermoy,Co.  Cork.
Salmonellosis  in cattle  is becoming  an increasing  problem  on intensive  Irish dairy  farms  
with an upward  trend in outbreaks  over the last decade.  Over  2000 different  serotypes  
of salmonella  exist. However  two. Salmonella  dublin and Salmonella  typhimurium  
account  for 80 to 90 % of salmonella  infections  in cattle (Mcliroy  et al, 1990). Hence,  
this paper  will concentrate  on these  two important  serotypes.  In Ireland,  S. dublin  is the 
most prevalent  type infecting  cattle.
Q. How would  I know  whether  my herd is infected?
Clinical  signs  are the first indicators  of infection.  Salmonellosis  demonstrates  a distinct  
seasonal  prevalence  with the majority  of cases  occurring  during  the winter  and spring,  
reflecting  the temporal  distribution  of calvings.
Abortion
With S dublin,  the typical  sign is sporadic  mid to late term abortion  or an abortion  storm.  
This usually  occurs  without  any other signs of disease  (Hinton,  1974; Choo, 1989),  
although  retention  of the placenta  is common.  Abortions  usually  occur around  the 
seventh  month of pregnancy.  Cases may occur as early as the fourth month of 
pregnancy  right up to full term. The peak incidence  of salmonella  abortions  occurs  
between  October  and December.  While there are numerous  causes  of sporadic  
abortions,  salmonella  infection  along with leptospira  and neospora  infections,  are the 
main causes  of multiple  abortions.  Foetuses  aborted  following  salmonella  infection  are 
likely to be decomposed,  as the interval  between  infection  and abortion  is approximately  
a week. Older  cows are more likely to abort. Herds  affected  are typically  large, closed  
herds where  the owner  recognised  that there was an infectious  disease  problem  (O’ 
Reilly and Egan, 1988). Stillborn,  premature  and full term infected  calves  may also be 
delivered.
In order to establish  whether  an abortion  in your herd was caused  by salmonella  
infection,  you need to submit  the foetus  for post-mortem  examination.  A single  blood  
sample from the aborted  cow may not be diagnostic.  A recent study showed  no 
difference  in the prevalence  of antibodies  to S. dublin in single blood samples  from 
aborted  compared  to non-aborted  cows in Irish herds (Meleady  et al, 2000). The 
authors  stated  that the blood test (SAT) is not the most sensitive  test and should  only 
be used as an adjunct  to culture  of the organism.  Submission  of the foetus,  preferably  
with the placenta  and a vaginal,  faecal  or milk sample  from the cow may also assist  
diagnosis  of other  causes  of abortion.  Unfortunately,  a recent  report  indicated  that only 
about 13% of all bovine  abortions  are investigated  by submission  of material  to the local 
veterinary  laboratory  (Anon.  1999). Recent  figures  from the Department  of Agriculture  
Food and Rural Development  indicate  that salmonella  infection  is the most commonly  
diagnosed  cause  of abortion  in cattle  (Table  1). The increase  in incidence  of salmonella
101
abortions  between  1999 and 2000 (Limerick  RVL: 17 to 37%) was attributed  to wet 
weather,  heavy fluke infestation,  poor nutrition  and the shortage  of vaccine  (Anon.  
2000). Some  calves  infected  in the last month  of pregnancy  will survive  to term and can 
perpetuate  the cycle of infection  in later years on the farm. Newborn  calves  may be 
infected  by suckling  milk from infected  cows or from contaminated  bedding.

Diarrhoea/dysentery  in adult  cattle
Outbreaks  of diarrhoea  (with or without  blood  or casts  of the bowel)  in adult  cattle  should  
raise suspicions  of salmonellosis.  Initial cases  may present  with vague  signs such as 
'just not doing  well since  calving ’. Affected  cattle  (often  only one or two initially),  will run 
a high temperature,  have foetid,  watery  diarrhoea,  refuse  feed and have a sudden  fall 
in milk yield. Subsequently,  animals  will appear  dull and lethargic  with sunken  eyes and 
loss of body condition  developing.  S. typhimurium  is more likely to cause  these  signs  
than S. dublin. Clinical  signs may resemble  mucosal  disease  but are more sudden  in 
onset. Abortion  is not usually an accompanying  problem. Outbreaks  are often  
associated  with the stress of calving  and onset of lactation  and many cows can be 
affected  over a short period. Cows can become  seriously  ill and despite  intensive 
veterinary  care, losses  can be high. Mortality  rates of up to 40% have been reported. 
In general  calves  in infected  herds  are not similarly  affected.
Diarrhoea,  pneumonia,  meningitis,  joint-ill,  gangrene  in calves
Salmonella  infections  in calves  are typically  caused  by S. typhimurium  but S. dubin  can 
be involved  on dairy farms  (Greene  and Dempsey,  1986). Calf problems  are often not 
accompanied  by abortion  in cows, but there may be a previous  history  of abortion. 
Unlike nutritional  diarrhoea,  salmonella  infection  can cause severe diarrhoea,  with 
calves  becoming  ill very quickly. Mixed  infections  with other organisms  also occur. In 
cases  of septicaemia,  where  the bacteria  enter  the bloodstream,  calves  may be found 
dead within  days of calving,  without  other signs. More often, affected  calves  are a few
102
weeks of age and a number  are affected  together.  Severe  pneumonia  may accompany  
tie diarrhoea  or be a separate  syndrome,  often  with other  respiratory  infections.  Cases  
of salmonella,  meningitis  and joint-ill  are usually  sporadic.  Following  an outbreak  of 
salmonellosis  in calves,  a number  of the survivors,  often too stunted  to sell, will develop  
osteomyelitis  of the limbs  or neck vertebrae  or dry gangrene  of the ears, tail and lower  
tabs (Power  and O’Keefe,  1991, Mee, 1995).
Q. Could  my herd  be infected  without  these  problems?
Yes. Infection  is not synonymous  with disease.  In the case of S. dublin,  which  is host- 
specific,  carrier  cows  can maintain  latent  infection  within  a herd for years  without  clinical  
signs. One asymptomatic  carrier  cow can shed over 10 billion  S. dublin  organisms  per 
day into the environment  (Smith and House, 1992). As the stress and metabolic  
dianges  at calving  may precipitate  excretion,  this is the best time to attempt  to detect  
carriers. However,  few cows  which  abort  due to S. dublin  continue  to excrete  salmonella  
althe subsequent  calving  (Aitken,  1987). Excretion  of S. typhimurium  usually  only lasts  
lor weeks to months,  but environmental  contamination  is important  in maintaining  
infection,  for over five years in some cases  (Wray  et al., 1989). Disease  may only be 
activated  following  stress  such as upon housing,  calving,  feed shortages,  outwintering  
in inclement  weather,  overcrowding  towards  the end of the calving  season  or transport  
of calves.
Detection  of carrier  animals  is difficult  as they may shed salmonella  in their faeces  
intermittently.  Hence,  frequent  milk (Giles  and King, 1987)  or faecal  culture  of individual  
animals  is required  (van Duijkeren  et al., 1995). If salmonella  were  shed by 5 % of cows  
in a herd, to have 90 % certainty  of detecting  the organism  in at least one cow tested,
I would be necessary  to test 37 cows. Blood  samples  may also be examined  for SAT 
antibodies  to salmonella  but titres in chronic  carriers  may be low. ELISAs  have now 
been developed,  for both blood  and milk, which  predict  carrier  status  using  two samples  
Iwo months  apart and facilitate  herd screening  (Hoofar  and Bitsch,  1995; Spier et al., 
1990).
Q. How can I prevent  infection  getting  into my herd?
Salmonella  can enter a herd in livestock,  feed, water, wildlife,  birds, humans  and 
vehicles,  or may be airborne.  Most likely  modes  of transmission  are via carrier  livestock  
and wildlife  (Evans  and Davies,  1996).
To prevent  entry via carrier  livestock  you need to maintain  a closed  herd policy, avoid  
direct animal-to-animal  contact  with neighbouring  cattle and isolate  animals  returned  
unsold from the mart or purchased  animals.  There  is no evidence  of venereal  spread  
of infection.  Wild life vectors  (rodents,  badgers  and foxes),  (Humphrey  and Bygrave,  
1988 Euden,  1990), domestic  and wild birds (seagulls,  pigeons,  starlings,  swallows,  
crows, geese)  and domestic  pets (cats and dogs) may transmit  salmonellae.  These  
vectors can act as long-term  reservoirs  of infection. Droppings  containing  S. 
typhimurium  can contaminate  feed stores,  feed troughs  and water  troughs  (Eld, et at., 
1991; Johnston,  et al., 1979; Warnick,  et al., 1995). It has been suggested  that the 
proximity  of a sewerage  treatment  plant or landfill  dump may increase  this risk (Crilly,
103
2000a).  Covering  feed and water  troughs  (where  practical)  may reduce  this risk along 
with installing  netting  and removing  nests of wild birds from feed sheds and animal  
accommodation.  While S. dublin  and typhimurium  are not commonly  associated  with 
feedstuffs,  other salmonella  species  may be present  (Eld, et al., 1991). With the 
removal  of animal  proteins  from feedstuffs  this risk is greatly  reduced.  Most  isolates are 
now found in wheat  or other  cereal  ingredients,  largely  caused  by wild bird and rodent  
droppings  (Davies,  2001).
Q. Immediately  infection  has been  detected  in my herd, what  should  I do?
A presumptive  veterinary  clinical  diagnosis  will precede  the laboratory  diagnosis  of 
salmonellosis.  Therapy  will be based  on the tentative  diagnosis  and may be revised  
depending  on the results  of the laboratory  diagnosis  and antibiotic  sensitivity  results.  
Because  the course  of the disease  can be unpredictable,  ranging  from a single  case  to 
an outbreak,  prompt,  intensive  veterinary  therapy  is advisable  in all suspicious  cases.  
Hygiene  practises  should  be upgraded  including  installation  of footbaths  near affected  
housing.
1. Abortion.
In the case of an abortion,  it may take a week before a laboratory  diagnosis  is 
confirmed.  In the interim  other  cases  may occur,  particularly  in seasonally  calving  herds 
where  herd-mates  are at a similar  stage  of pregnancy.  In such cases  the aborted  animal  
should be isolated,  samples  submitted  to the laboratory,  the contaminated  bedding  
destroyed  and more frequent  observations  conducted  on the remaining  pregnant  
animals  in the group. Where  one animal  has aborted  due to salmonella  infection,  it is 
likely that other pregnant  animals  are infected. Whether  they abort or not may be 
determined  by the extent  of the infectious  challenge,  the degree  of immunity  and the 
level of environmental  stress. If the placenta  and foetus are already  infected,  I 
irreversible  toxaemia  and lesions  may be present  that will lead to foetal mortality  and i 
abortion,  irrespective  of what control  measures  are adopted.  However,  some  of the in' 
contact  animals  or animals  in other groups  may not be infected  at the time of the first j 
abortion.  i
In a situation  where  a salmonella  abortion  has been diagnosed,  attempts  can be made 
to protect  other pregnant  animals  by implementing  a vaccination  regime. As there is 
now a product  license  for such an indication,  this policy  has been recommended  by the 
manufacturer  in the face of a potential  outbreak.  Empirical  advice  is to use three  doses  
of vaccine  at ten day intervals  in the face of an outbreak  (Roche,  pers. com.).  
Experience  with vaccination  in the face of an outbreak  has resulted  in variable  
responses  (Davies  and Renton,  1992; Hunter  and Peek, 1977; Mee and Malone,  1995).  
Poor responses  may be due to prior infection  in the placenta  and foetus  of pregnant  
animals  and the delay before  an immune  response  to the vaccine  is protective  (two 
weeks  after the second  dose of the primary  vaccination  course).  However,  prevention  
of secondary  outbreaks  has been attributed  to vaccination  in the face of the primary  
outbreak  along  with other  control  measures  (Hunter  and Peek, 1977; Hatch,  1974).  
Preventative  antibiotic  treatment  (injection  or bolus)  of ‘at-risk ’ dry, pregnant  cows may
104
theoretically  reduce  the infection  level in animals  in the short-term.  However,  this will 
not totally  eliminate  excretion  of salmonellae  by carrier  animals.  In-contact  animals  will 
still be susceptible  to re-infection  and there is a risk of antibiotic  resistance  developing.
Treatment  of ‘at-risk ’ pregnant,  dry, or lactating  animals  with a polyvalent  sero-vaccine  
(eg. Grovax,  Intervet  Ltd.) may provide  immediate  protection  against  infection  in the 
short-term  and increase  immunity  in the long term following  a booster  dose of vaccine  
(eg. Bovivac  S, Intervet  Ltd), (Davies  and Renton,  1992). Whether  this regime  is cost-  
effective  given the variable  risk of further  abortions  and product  cost has not been 
established.
2. Diarrhoea/dysentery  in adult  cattle.
Following  treatment  of clinically  affected  animals,  vaccination  of all at-risk  animals  twice  
at a three-week  interval  and affected  animals  upon recovery  is advised  to reduce  
excretion  and to prevent  secondary  outbreaks  (Robinson,  1997). However,  because  
animals  with diarrhoea  will have contaminated  their environment  with salmonellae,  
water  and feed troughs  may need to be emptied,  disinfected  and raised  to prevent  re­
contamination.  Bedding  will need to be removed  and destroyed.
Salmonellosis  in calves.
In the face of an outbreak,  antibiotic  therapy  and sero-vaccine  can be used along  with 
supportive  electrolyte  and other  therapies.  The recent  appearance  of a multi antibiotic  
resistant  strain  of S. typhimurium,  type 104, has made  choice  of antimicrobial  even more  
important  (Davies,  2001). Where  contamination  of the calf accommodation  is likely to 
have occurred,  hygiene  and disinfection  are important  to reduce  the on going risk of 
transmission.  For example,  salmonellae  can be transmitted  via saliva  on poorly  washed  
calf buckets. As salmonellae  can also be transmitted  via air borne infection  within  
accommodation,  different  age groups  should  not be housed  together.  Clinically  affected  
calves, particularly  those with pneumonia,  should be isolated  from healthy  calves.  
Vaccination  of calves  can be commenced  after three  weeks  of age with a booster  dose  
within two to three weeks. Modern  live salmonella  vaccines  can significantly  reduce  
mortality  in field outbreaks  (Selim  et al., 1995),  but other  studies  have failed  to show  a 
benefit  to routine  vaccination  (Tyler et al., 1999). Depending  on how compact  the 
calving  season  is, it is advisable  to vaccinate  pregnant  cows  at six to eight and three  to 
four weeks  pre-calving.  This will boost salmonella-specific  colostral  antibodies  thus 
providing  passive  protection  to calves  by reducing  both excretion  and losses.
Q. In the long-term  how can I reduce  my risk from salmonellosis?
As not all herds  are at equal  risk of infection,  particular  circumstances  must be factored  
into the guidelines  issued. For example,  recent  international  data indicate  a significantly  
higher  risk of salmonellosis  in large compared  to small herds (Warnick  et al., 1995). 
Enterprise  type affects  risk. Data from the UK indicates  that calf rearers  are more  likely  
to have problems  with salmonellosis  than other  enterprises.  Risk may also vary from 
year to year, being higher  in wet years when inclement  weather,  underfeeding  and 
possibly  liver fluke infection  can increase  the incidence  of disease.
105
Closed  herd.
This most basic biosecurity  measure  can be difficult  to implement  where  culling  rates  
are high or a stock bull is purchased.  However,  it does prevent  access  of a carrier 
animal  and reduces  risk from livestock  vehicles.  In the UK, a four-fold  higher  risk of S. 
typhimurium  infection  was associated  with purchase  of animals  from dealers  compared 
to other farms (Evans  and Davies,  1996). When  animals  are purchased,  ideally  they 
should  be sampled  upon arrival and maintained  in quarantine  until results  are clear.  
Where  cattle must be purchased,  direct purchase  from herds with a salmonella-free  
status  will reduce  risk. Unnecessary  visitors  should  be discouraged  as salmonella  can 
be transmitted  on footwear.
Boundary  fencing
Avoiding  direct  contact  with neighbouring  animals  reduces  herd-to-herd  transmission.  
Feed  and water  hygiene
Access  to feed stores  by rodents,  cats, dogs and wild birds should  be restricted.  For 
example,  using bait stations  to reduce  rodent  numbers  and netting  to restrict  access  by 
birds. Water  bowls  and troughs  that either  have protective  lids or are high enough  to 
prevent  faecal  contamination  reduce  the risk of spread.  Stagnant  water  and areas  likely  
to flood should  be fenced  off. Slurry  should  be spread  on arable  land or on land not to 
be grazed  for at least a month.
Accommodation  hygiene
Calf-to-calf  spread  can be reduced  by removal  of bedding  between  batches  of calves, 
and maintaining  adequate  drainage.  Ensure  calves  lie up on the bedding  and not near 
the water  troughs,  feed troughs  or milk nipples  by providing  bedded  and un-bedded  
areas  in group  pens. Salmonella  can survive  for at least six years  in buildings  in dried  
faeces  (Plym-Forshell  and Ekesbo,  1996)  and for months  on pasture.  It has been  found 
that using a power  washer  without  first removing  faecal  contamination  and disinfecting  
can create an infectious  aerosol and contribute  to spread of disease  within calf 
accommodation  (Wray,  1993). Even after intensive  disinfection  procedures  have been  
followed,  salmonellae  can survive  for several  months  in some premises  (Twiddy  et al., 
1988). Individual  penning  of calves  has not been  shown  to prevent  excretion  compared  
to group penning,  as non-contagious  routes of transmission  are equally  important  
(Wray, 1993). Large  calf houses  are best subdivided  to reduce  the common  airspace  
susceptible  to aerosolisation  (Wathes  et al., 1988), Where  serious  problems  occur,  
removing  calves  either  to temporary  accommodation,  or out to grass  with shelter  will be 
necessary.
Isolation
Dedicated  isolation  facilities  are associated  with reduced  risk of salmonella  spread  
(Evans  and Davies, 1996). Regular  cleaning  out of calving  accommodation  also 
prevents  neonatal  infection  (Anon,  1992),  particularly  if used to house  an aborted  cow.
106
Treatment  for fluke infection
There  may be increased  risk of carriers  and salmonellosis  in herds  with fluke infection  
(Aitken  et at., 1979),  though  this relationship  has been challenged  (Morisse  and Cotte,  
1994;  Taylor  and Kilpatrick,  1975). Treatment  during  the dry period,  is advisable  in high-  
risk herds. As fluke infection  is often subclinical  or non-clinical,  it is worth regularly  
checking  for liver lesions  in cull cows  at the abattoir.  With wet summers  infection  levels  
may be high.
Control  of concurrent  infections
It has been suggested  that salmonella  infections  are more severe in herds with 
underlying  temporary  immunosuppression  caused by bovine virus diarrhoea  or 
respiratory  virus infections  (Penny  et al., 1996, Wray and Roeder,  1987),  though  this 
relationship  has been challenged  (Morisse  and Cotte,  1994). Control  of the concurrent  
infections  may reduce  the severity  of salmonella  infection.  [Control  of BVDV  infection  
is dealt with in the paper  by Sexton].  As no information  is available  on the concurrent  
use of Bovivac  S with other vaccines,  no other vaccine  should  be administered  within  
two weeks  before  or after Bovivac  S use. It should  also be noted  that use of a common  
rectal thermometer,  without  disinfection,  could spread salmonella  between  cases  
(McAllister  et al., 1986).
Colostrum  feeding
Passive  protection  from colostrum  can play a critical  role in reducing  excretion  and the 
risk of clinical  disease.  Assisted  suckling  or artificial  colostrum  feeding  after  calving  and 
prolonged  feeding  of vaccinates  colostrum  for at least two weeks  will reduce  risk of 
excretion.
Immunostimulation
There may be a practical  benefit  in supplementing  at-risk  animals  with vitamin  E and 
selenium  to improve  their immunity  (Davies  and Renton,  1992; Finch et al., 1986; 
Cawley  et al., 1986). Enhanced  production  of antibodies  to S. typhimurium  has been  
found in cattle  following  vitamin  E and selenium  supplementation  (Nemec  et al., 1990). 
Patented  immunostimulants  are claimed  to establish  protection  more rapidly with 
salmonella  vaccines  (Immvac  Inc.,).
Vaccination
Currently,  there is only one salmonella  vaccine  licensed  in the Republic  of Ireland;  
Bovivac  S (Intervet  Ireland Ltd.). This compares  with more than ten salmonella  
vaccines  in the USA. Bovivac  S (which contains  both S. dublin and typhimurium  
antigens),  is licensed  (September,  2001)  for the active  immunisation  of cattle  in order  to 
induce  serological  and colostral  antibody  production  and in the face of an outbreak  to 
reduce  S. typhimurium  infections  as part of an overall  management  programme.  The 
licence  does not specify  prevention  of either  salmonella  abortions,  or diarrhoea  in adults  
or calves  where  no prior evidence  of infection  exists. It may not provide  cross-protection
107
against  exotic  strains  of salmonella.  However,  it is widely  used on dairy  farms  to prevent  
these problems,  especially  salmonella  abortions.  Empirically,  vaccination  has been 
used for some  30 years  in the control  of salmonella  abortion  (Cotgreave  and Cameron,  
1974)  and many  veterinary  practitioners  believe  it is efficacious.  A recent  questionnaire  
survey  of dairy farmers  in discussion  groups  showed  42% of farmers  vaccinated  their 
cattle  against  salmonellosis  (Table  2).
Table  2: Use of vaccines  in dairy herds  in Munster  and Leinster  (1999-2000)
Disease No. of herds % of herds  vaccinated
Leptospirosis 208 78
Salmonellosis 207 42
BVD 110 6
No economic  assessment  has been conducted  on the cost-effectiveness  of annual  re­
vaccination  whether  following  a salmonella  outbreak  or in the absence  of a confirmed  
problem.  Specific  experimental  data have not been generated  to quantify  the duration  
of immunity  or the effectiveness  of a single  booster  dose of Bovivac  S. As the disease  
may be self-limiting,  the efficacy  of vaccination  following  some outbreaks  may be 
overestimated  (Mee, 1990). Outbreaks  of salmonellosis  on a calf-rearing,  dairy or beef 
unit, with abortions  and mortalities  have run to estimated  losses  of between  £5,000  and 
£20,000  (Peters, 1985; Mee and Malone, 1995; Davies and Renton, 1992).  
Circumstantial  evidence  in 1999/2000,  when supplies  of vaccine  were unavailable  and 
salmonella  outbreaks  increased,  indicates  vaccination  may be preventing  clinical  cases  
and, hence,  economic  losses. Vaccination  may be more relevant  following  outbreaks  of
S. dublin  than following  S. typhimurium  as in the latter case the disease  can be self 
limiting  while in the former  infection  can persist  for years. Vaccination  has been shown  
to significantly  reduce S. typhimurium  excretion  in problem  herds (Davies,  1997).  
Premature  discontinuation  of vaccination  (<2 years)  following  a salmonella  outbreak  has 
been associated  with new or recurrent  infections  (Davies,  1997). A recent  review  of 
bovine  salmonella  vaccines  in the USA concluded  that such products  provide  partial  
protection  varying  between  good and ineffective  against  salmonella  challenge  (House 
and Smith,  1997). Lack of controlled  split-herd  vaccination  studies  limits interpretation  
of the effectiveness  of current  vaccination  regimes.
With increased  animal  health  problems  in dairy herds  and vaccines  available  for cows 
against  leptospirosis,  salmonellosis,  BVDV,  rotavirus,  coronavirus  and Escherichia  coli, 
some  farmers  are questioning  the need to use some  or all of these  products  in order  to 
reduce  costs. The unique  risk factors  on each farm must be recognised  when making 
this decision.  Whether  vaccination  should  be carried  out and for how long is a decision  
to be made  following  consultation  with your veterinary  practitioner  and local veterinary  
laboratory,  as necessary.  When  faced with potential  animal  and financial  losses  from 
salmonellosis,  the precautionary  principle  is generally  adopted. At current  vaccine  
costs, prevention  of only one or two salmonella  abortions  or mortalities  annually  would
108
tie sufficient  to cover the costs of vaccination  (Wright  and Fernando,  1993). This 
assumes  abortions  or mortalities  would  continue  to occur  in the absence  of vaccination  
and not following  vaccination.  However,  there may be farmers  using  vaccine  where  an 
economic  response  would not be predicted  from the farm risk profile and disease  
history. In economic  terms, vaccination  is justified  where E, > VC/(DC  x VE). E| is 
expected  incidence  of disease,  VC is vaccination  cost, DC is disease  case cost and VE 
B vaccine  efficacy.  Enterprises  with a high risk such as calf rearers  or large, open dairy  
herds, with active  BVD or fluke infection,  possibly  close  to landfill  dumps,  or herds  with 
a recent history  of salmonellosis  may benefit  more  than lower  risk enterprises.
Q. What  are the risks of human  infection  from salmonella  on the farm?
In considering  whether  to adopt  a control  policy  against  salmonella,  the risk of human  
nfection  should  be considered.  The primary  risk is with S. typhimurium.  In a UK study,  
ZO % of farms  affected with S. typhimurium  DT104 had possible  or confirmed  associated  
human illness in farm workers  or family (Evans  and Davies,  1996). Children  who 
participate  in calf feeding  and handling  are particularly  at risk (Wall, et al., 1995). 
Personal  hygiene  should  be emphasised.  Infection  may be contracted  via direct or 
txiirect  contact  or consumption  of unpasteurised  milk. It should  be recognised  that the 
rcidence  of salmonella  in randomly  selected  bulk tank raw milk in the Republic  of 
teland is extremely  low (<0.20  %) (Rea,  et al., 1992). Cows  with S. dublin  infection  may 
Pe prone to more assisted  calvings  (Richardson,  1973) which presents  the risk of 
lermatitis  to farmers  or veterinarians  handling  infected  cows. Salmonella  may also be 
ransmitted  via mouth-to-mouth  resuscitation;  hence  this practise  is not advisable  for 
|»eak calves  (Ahmad,  et al., 1990).
Conclusions.
iaimonellosis  can be a devastating  disease  causing  severe  financial  loss in certain  
igh-risk herds. Current  control methods  are a mixture  of proven and empirical  
Kasures. Knowledge  gaps in the disease  epidemiology  and efficacy  of preventive  
leasures  under Irish farming  conditions  frustrate  attempts  to develop  clearer  control  
olicies. Towards  this end, Teagasc  Moorepark  has initiated  a research  programme  on 
almonella  epidemiology  in conjunction  with the Cork Regional  Veterinary  Laboratory,  
Cork County  Council  and local hospitals  (Crilly,  2000b).

Definition
IDovine Viral Diarrhoea  (BVD) is a cattle virus. This is a misnomer  since the name 
masks the true range  of symptoms  which  it can elicit. It is believed  to be in Ireland  for 
lie last 50 years. BVD is very similar  to classical  swine  fever  in pigs and border  disease  
(1 sheep. In humans,  it is not unlike  Rubella  (measles)  though  it is important  to note that 
Itdoes not cause  any symptoms  or disease.
Contagious  spread
D virus only survives  for short periods  of time outside  its host animal  (cattle)  and is 
refore dependent  on them for its transmission.  Cattle typically  carry the virus for 
Isbout three weeks  after initial infection.  In this period  of time they may spread  the virus  
those it comes  in contact  with (transient  carriers).  Some  animals  carry the virus for 
le. These are called persistently  infected  carriers  (Rl.) and they are much more 
fctive in spreading  the disease. To a lesser  extent,  other ruminants  (sheep)  and 
mans  can also transmit  the virus to cattle.
transmission
Diere are two main ways of spread  within  a herd:
Mionta!  Spread
Tiis occurs where a carrier  (transient  or persistent)  passes  the virus onto another  
nimal.
Meal Spread
Wical transmission  is from dam to offspring  and only occurs  in the womb.
SYMPTOMS
liese can vary quite a lot and depend  on the transmission  type and the stage of 
regnancy. In the case of vertical  transmission,  the virus has the ability  to cross the 
mb wall into the placenta  where  it has easy access  to the developing  embryo.  If this 
ccurs in the first half of pregnancy,  then one may find a lot of repeat  breeders  due to 
arly embryonic  death . If the embryo  is at the three  to four month  stage  of development,  
lenthe embryo  may well survive  infection  and a persistently  infected  animal  (P.l.) will 
eborn.
infection  takes  place later on in pregnancy,  abortion  is a likely outcome.  Sometimes  
tortion may not occur  and those  that survive  it may be born with defects,  mainly  of a 
keletal or neurological  order.
113
Horizontal  spread causes few problems  especially  in non-breeding  adult stock.  
However  it can be a problem  if it enters a young calf population.  There is some 
evidence  to show that it affects  the immune  systems  of calves,  thus leaving  them 
susceptible  to pneumonias,  scours  and other  infections.
TREATMENT
There  is no treatment  for B.V.D.  infection.  Symptoms  may be treated  but the virus may 
not. Therefore  the only control  is prevention.
CONTROL
Eradication
Some  form of eradication  should  be attempted  as part of a control  programme.  This is 
based  around  the detection  and elimination  of persistent  carriers  (P.I.). This is done by 
checking  animals  to see whether  or not they are carrying  the virus. Depending  on the 
severity  of the problem  in the herd, this can be a full herd screen  (where  all breeding  
stock are checked),  partial screen (replacement  heifers  checked  every year) or a 
“bought-in ” screen  (where  all bought-in  breeding  stock are examined).  Maintaining  a 
closed  herd status  is vital where  any of the above  is being  attempted.
Vaccination
The aim of vaccination  should  be to reduce  the deleterious  impact  of B.V.D.  infection on 
the overall  herd health. If fertility  problems  are the most obvious  symptom  in the herd, 
then pre-breeding  vaccination  is essential.  This will also help eliminate  vertical  spread  
and so also reduce  the creation  of P.l. animals.  Alternatively,  if neonatal  calf problems  
are the major manifestation,  then pre-calving  vaccination  to booster  the colostral  
antibodies  may be the most opportune  time.
I.B.R. (Infectious  Bovine  Rhinotracheitis)
Similar  to B.V.D.,  this is a cattle  viral infection  which  can cross  the placenta  and cause  
abortions.  There  are two distinct  syndromes  here:
Calf Pneumonia  Complex.
Adult infections.
Calf penumonia  complex
Viral pneumonia  in calves  is an annual  problem,  be it, in neonates  in late spring,  or 
weaners  in the autumn. The pathogenesis  is quite similar  with in many cases a 
combination  of viruses  infecting  susceptible  animals.  One of the most  common  of these  
viruses  is I.B.R. It is difficult  to treat, but can be controlled  by vaccination  where  it is 
diagnosed.
114
Early neonatal  pneumonia
This usually  occurs  in young bucket  fed calves  in housed  conditions.  As late March  
early April approaches,  numbers  increase,  temperatures  rise and housing  gets stuffy. In 
this environment,  I.B.R. flourishes.  This problem  can be treated  with an array of 
antibiotics.  However,  where  I.B.R. is identified,  vaccination  should  also be considered.  
Where possible,  the intra nasal route should  be used since this can be given to very 
young calves before any lung damage  occurs and can elicit a prompt  antibody  
response.
Weaner  pneumonia
Typically  this can occur in late September  to early December  depending  on weather  
conditions,  weaning  and or transporation  and movement.  Prevention  here is easier  to 
apply since the time of weaning  and transport  is ccalendar  based and therefore  
vaccination  can be given at an appropriate  interval  beforehand.
Adult infections
I.B.R. is an alpha Herpesvirus.  These  viruses  do not survive  too long outside  the host 
animal. However  when  they infect  an animal,  the virus remains  there  for life. The host 
produces  antibodies  to the virus and after time they both (antibody  and virus) balance  
one another  out. At this stage,  these animals  no longer  shed the virus and therefore  
they appear  as normal. However,  the virus can be reactivated  at times of stress,  
calving, hoose  infestation  and thus the animal  may start shedding  it and passing  the 
infection  onto others.
Abortion
This is one of the most common  symptoms.  Diagnosis  is best made by getting  part of 
the placenta  and caruncle  (button)  tested  for the infection.  Blood  samples  may also be 
useful in checking  for antibodies.
Febrile Cow
Sometimes  cows can present  with very elevated  temps,  106F, no milk, very dull and 
depressed  and sometimes  diarrhoea.  It is quite common  to get more than one cow 
affected  at any one time. Serological  samples  or nasal  swabs  can confirm  the diagnosis  
here. However  it is important  to note that there are many more conditions  that ccan 
cause the above  symptoms.
Vaccination  (in adults)
Vaccination  of adult  cattle  against  I.B.R. is not very common.  However,  where  either  of 
the above problems  exists  it should  be cxansidered.  Most commercial  vaccines  can be 
given either  intranasally  or intramuscularly.  Obviously,  in adult  cattle,  the latter  might  be 
more practical.

Neospora  caninum  abortion  in cattle
DONAL  TOOLAN
Regional  Veterinary  Laboratory,  Hebron  Road,  Leggatsrath,  Kilkenny
Introduction
Neospora  caninum  (N. caninum)  abortion  has recently  been recognised  worldwide  as 
an economically  important  cause of bovine  abortion. In 1990, workers  in California  
reported  that Neospora  caninum  was associated  with 18% of bovine  foetuses  submitted  
for routine  examination  as to the cause of abortion. However,  in a study involving  
20,000  cattle,  where  every  abortion  was investigated,  they concluded  that N. caninum  
was responsible  for 43% of abortions.
Cause
N. caninum  is a protozoan  parasite  that closely  resembles  Toxoplasma  gondii  (T.gondii),  
a common  cause of abortion  in sheep. The details  of the life cycle are still being 
investigated  but the following  is known:
The dog is a definitive  host and is the principal  source  of infection  for cattle. An infected  
dog passes  infective  oocysts  in its faeces. If a cow ingests  these  oocysts,  it becomes  
infected  persistently.  This can lead to abortion,  or a full term calf born with nervous  
signs  (unable  to stand  or walk properly)  or to the birth of a full term, clinically  normal  calf 
that develops  normally  but remains  persistently  infected  and may abort in future.  
There  is an important  difference  between  T. gondii  infection  in sheep  and N. caninum  
infection  in cattle. Sheep  infected  with toxoplasmosis  normally  abort  only once  from this 
cause  so it is worthwhile  retaining  them in the flock. On the other  hand,  a cow infected  
with N. caninum  may abort repeatedly.
Prevalence
N. caninum  was initially  reported  from California  but has now been confirmed  worldwide.  
Surveys  in Britain,  Northern  Ireland  and in Kilkenny  showed  that the incidence  in these 
areas  was similar  to each other  but not as high as in California.  It was estimated  that 6 
- 8 % of foetal brains  in this part of the world  showed  evidence  of foetal  infection.  The 
comparable  figure  for California  was 18%.
Clinical  signs
In some herds only one or two abortions  due to N. caninum  occur  whereas  in other 
heavily  infected  herds,  the abortion  rate may reach  20-30%,  An animal  infected  with N. 
caninum  may abort repeatedly  or may abort one year, have an apparently  normal  calf 
the following  year and abort again the year after that. The first time a herd becomes  
heavily  infected  with N. caninum,  abortions  may occur  as a storm,  with a quarter  or a 
third of the herd aborting  over  a couple  of weeks.  Abortions  due to Neospora  may occur  
at any stage  of gestation.  There  is often a peak at 5 to 6 months  gestation.  In Kilkenny,  
a lesser  peak at 8 to 9 months  has been observed.  A foetus  aborted  due to N. caninum  
does not show  any characteristic  change  on visual  examination.  Neither  are there any 
gross  alterations  in the afterbirth.
116
Diagnosis
Diagnosis  of neosporosis  is made  by iaboratory  tests and clinicai  history. N. caninum  
may occur  in conjunction  with other  causes  of abortion  so it is important  to investigate  
abortions  thoroughly  for all diagnosable  causes of abortion. This involves  the 
submission  of the foetus,  placenta  and a blood sample  from the dam. In Kilkenny  
laboratory,  the blood of all foetuses  is screened  for N. caninum  antibodies.  The brain  
may be examined  microscopically  in selected  cases. Blood samples  from cows that 
have aborted  are screened  routinely  for Salmonella  dublin  and for Leptospira  hardjo  and 
are tested  for N. caninum  if requested.
Prevalence  in South-East  Ireland
A survey  of the local prevalence  of N. caninum  was made, based on the material  
submitted  to Kilkenny  Regional  Veterinary  Laboratory  for the diagnosis  of bovine  
abortion  in the twelve  months  July 99 to June 00. Serological  evidence  of N. caninum  
infection  was found in 7% of foetuses  and in 14% of cows that had aborted  recently. 
These figures show that exposure  to N. caninum  is widespread.  An alternative  
diagnosis  of the cause  of abortion  was found in almost  half of these animals,  so the 
percentage  of abortions  primarily  due to N. caninum  is lower. An animal  positive  for N. 
caninum  was identified  in 48 herds. Sixteen  of the farmers  involved  replied  to a 
questionnaire.  Roughly  two thirds (63%) of those who responded  had a low abortion  
rate in their herds,  just one or two abortions  in the year. A possible  alternative  cause  of 
abortion was found in 40% of these (one case of salmonellosis  and three of 
leptospirosis).  Therefore,  the diagnosis  of N. caninum  abortion  in a herd does not 
necessarily  imply  that there will be widespread  losses.
The remaining  six farmers  that replied  to the questionnaire  reported  an abortion  rate of 
10 - 21% A possible  alternative  diagnosis  was found  in two thirds  of these  herds  (one 
of saimonellosis  and three of leptospirosis).  However,  in two herds,  'pr/was
of 21% and 15% respectively,  no other cause of abortion  was found and ‘hej® ^s 
widespread  evidence  of Neospora.  One of these herds had had severe  losses  the
previous  year from Neospora.
Case studies  of herds  with severe  Neospora  problem:
Dairy herd,  with 80 cows  and 15 heifers.  Over  the previous  three  years,  there  had been  
17,10  and 20 abortions.  At least 6 cows  aborted  more  than once.
Herd S:
Dairy herd with 75 cows. 12 cows aborted  in one week.
Risk to human  health
N. caninum  differs  from T. gondii  in that there is no evidence  of it being harmful  to 
humans.
117
Vaccination
There is a lot of research  being conducted  at the moment  into immunity  against  N. 
caninum,  but at present,  there is no proven  commercially  available  vaccine  available.  
However,  as cows aborting  from neosporosis  can abort again from the same  cause,  it 
is not clear  that it will be possible  to make an effective  vaccine.  Although  N. caninum  
resembles  T. gondii  in appearance  there is very limited  cross reaction  between  the two 
parasites  and therefore  a vaccine  against  toxoplasmosis  will not protect against  
neosporosis.
Control
The life cycle and methods  of infection  of cows  with N. caninum  are not sufficiently  well 
understood  to give confident  advice  on the control  of neosporosis.  While awaiting  a 
fuller understanding,  the following  suggestions  can be made;
It is good practice  to isolate  any animal  that looks about  to abort and to keep it away 
from the rest of the herd until it has cleansed  and ceased  to discharge.  However,  it has 
not been shown  that a cow aborting  from N. caninum  can transmit  the infection  to other 
cattle.
Dogs should  not be allowed  to contaminate  food or water. It is easy enough  to avoid 
access  to the concentrate  feed but dogs must also be prevented  from defaecating  on 
pasture.  (Will farm dogs in future  be kept in runs and will the farmer  let them out twice 
a day and follow  them with a plastic  bag and pick up after them??).  Stray dogs and 
dogs of hunters  should  be kept off the land. Foxes have not yet been shown  to be 
definitive  hosts  but it is possible  that they also are involved.  Dogs  should  be kept away 
from calving  pens and not allowed  access  to foetuses  or placentae.
As neosporosis  is often associated  with infection  by Salmonella  spp.or  by Leptospira  
spp., vaccination  against  these  organisms  may help to reduce  losses.
If the prevalence  of N. caninum  positive  animals  is low, culling  of such animals  may be 
practicable.
If the incidence  of neosporosis  is high and causes  high losses  each year, blood  testing  
the whole  herd might  be advisable.  Blood  tests are often positive  only around  the time 
of abortion  and in late pregnancy  and become  negative  at other  times,  so it is possible  
for infected  animals  to be missed  by the blood test. Repeat  blood tests may be 
necessary  to identify  all infected  animals. Once the infected  animals  are known,  
neosporosis  can be considered  as another  criterion  in deciding  on which  animals to cull 
each year. As the culled  infected  animals  are replaced  by purchased  or homebred  non- 
infected  animals,  both categories  of animal  should  be separated  at the time of calving  
or abortion.
There  is no reliable  way of showing  that a dog is free from N. caninum  infection.  The 
infective  stage  of the parasite  is shed for only a few days and is therefore  most unlikely  
to be discovered  by laboratory  examination.  By the time the abortions  start, the dog will 
have probably  ceased  to shed the parasite.
118
Conclusion
Exposure  to Neospora  is common  among  cows  in Ireland. In many  herds,  the infection  
rate is low and economic  losses  are slight. In occasional  herds,  the infection  rate is high 
and a sudden  catastrophic  abortion  storm  can occur  with a quarter  or a third of all cows  
aborting  over a couple  of weeks  and similar  heavy  abortion  losses  being repeated  in 
subsequent  years. There  is a lot of research  going on worldwide  into this problem  at 
present  and currently  there is a major  project  underway  at Abbotstown.  Hopefully  we 
will soon have better information  on which to base practical  advice  on methods  of 
control.

Sourcing  and Training  Labour  for the Future
L. MYLES
Farm  Apprenticeship  Board
Summary
Falling  numbers  in farming,  the drop in the number  of children  in farm families  and 
competition  from other  sectors  means  that labour  will continue  to be a scarce  resource  
in farming. Farmers  therefore  are in direct competition  with other sectors  of the 
economy  for available  labour. All potential  sources  of farm labour  are examined.
In part the solution  to the labour  problem  in farming  will be determined  by improved  
efficiencies  in existing  labour  use rather  than sourcing  extra/new  labour. This can be 
achieved  by the adoption  of efficient  work methods  and practices,  better  recruitment  of 
farm staff, retention  of staff and family  labour  through  better  treatment  and staff  training.  
Farmers/employers,  along with training providers  and others have a key role in 
promoting  a career  in agriculture  to increase  the entry  level to the industry.  The potential  
pool of labour  on ‘the doorstep ’ should  also be exploited.
Farmers  and the Industry  as a whole  can do more to increase  the uptake  of the wide 
range  of training  courses  now on offer for entrants  to farming.  Improving  the efficiency  
of existing  staff through  training  is another  option  open to farmer  employers.
Introduction
The availability  and cost of farm labour is one of the biggest  challenges  facing  
progressive  dairy  farmers.  The scarcity  of labour  in farming  is well known.  The demand  
for FAB graduates  (has for many  years)  outstripped  supply  by 4 to 1. The Farm Relief 
Services  constantly  struggle  to employ  sufficient  operators  to meet demand. Farm 
employers  will have to take on board proper recruitment  and staff management  
techniques  to compete  for and retain  employed  labour  in future.
The traditional/conventional  sources  of labour  are as follows;
Family  Labour:  owner,  spouse,  children,  extended  family.
Local hired help: the son or daughter  of a local family  who “rambled  in” at a young  
age and remained  on to become  a farm labourer/operative.
Existing  permanent  staff:: employed  from sources  other  than local help.  
Relief/part-time  workers  formally  organised  through  Farm Relief  Services.
Casual  help, students,  foreign  students.
Training  Schemes.
Placement  of students/trainees  on farms.
Graduates  of training  programmes.
Contractor  Services  - particularly  for silage,  slurry  etc.
Others?
Trends  in Labour  Supply
A review  of the available  data for people  working  in farming  clearly  shows  how the 
labour  pool in farming  has fallen.

In the five year period  1995-99:
• The total number  of people  contributing  some  labour  in agriculture  fell by 9%.
• The number  of farm holders  has fallen by 6.1%.
• The total number  of family  members  engaged  in farming  fell by 7.5%  with a dramatic  
drop of 15.4%  in the number  of spouses  contributing  to the farm labour  pool.
• The highest  percentage  drop at 16.8%  took place  among  employed  labour  - regular  
non family  workers.
• The biggest  concern  with regard  to the falling labour  pool in farming  is that the 
greatest  exit is taking  place among  the younger  people  (Table  2).

Over half the fall in farm holders  for the period  1995  - 1999 took place  among  the under  
35 year olds. The decrease  in the younger  farm population  has more significance  for 
labour  input in farming  than the general  fall in numbers  of people  engaged  in farming.  
This trend has increased  in recent  years  with C.S.O  data showing  the drop in farmer  
numbers  being mostly  accounted  for by the fall in those under  the age of 35 years.
121
Equally  alarming  is the dramatic  downturn  in the numbers  of young people  entering  
agricultural  training  courses  over the past six years.

A recent  ESRI study carried  out for Teagasc  by Kennedy  and Williams  estimated  that 
farmers  children  in the 16-20  age chart  will be 12,075 -a fall of 60% on 1996 levels  (i.e. 
5.5% reduction  per annum).  So the pool of farming  children  is going  to drop even more. 
It is worth noting that enrolment  in Horticultural  Courses  has remained  reasonably  
stable  over  the same  period. Why is this? Is it that the Horticultural  Sector  can compete  
more favourable  for labour? Is it more attractive?  The sources  of labour  have not 
changed  over time - the numbers  and competition  have! The jobs boom in the Tiger 
Economy  has created  competition  for available  labour. This is most clearly  illustrated  
by:
a) the dramatic  fall in farmers ’ spouses  engaged  in farming,
b) the serious  decline  in young  people  engaged  in farming  and,
c) the dramatic  downturn  in the numbers  participating  in agricultural  training  courses.
Solving  the labour  problem
So what  can be done  to slow down  or reverse  this trend?  What  can be done  to get more
out of the available  labour?
Labour  Efficiency
Due to technological  developments,  output per person engaged  in farming  has 
increased  dramatically  over time. However,  much  more can be achieved  in this area in 
terms  of farm facilities,  work methods,  labour  and time organisation  etc. Farmers  need 
to be educated  in this area to the potential  improvements  which exist on farms.  
Technology  and labour  efficiency  can redress  and correct  the labour  imbalance  on many  
farms.
Recruitment
Traditionally  farmers  have been poor in this area. Job description,  advertising  and 
selection  procedures  need to be improved  to compete  with other  job sectors.
122
staff Training
Labour  is one of the key factors  of production.  Yet little effort is made at training  and 
developing  staff employed  in farming. Staff training  receives  huge attention  in most  
other  areas  of employment.  Most  jobs are done poorly  because  of poor  or no instruction  
in the first place. Training  and instruction  results  in a good job being  done quickly  and 
safely, less mistakes,  increased  output,  improved  delegation,  greater  motivation  and 
personal  development.  End result  - better  performance  - higher  profits.
Training  Schemes
Heretofore  training  schemes  which involve  farm placement  - particularly  the Teagasc  
Certificate  in Farming  and the FAB Training  programme  - have been important  
providers  of labour  for the farmers  involved.  While  the trend in participation  levels  in all 
courses is down there will be a significant  increase  in on-farm  placements  in all 
agricultural  courses  approved  by the new National  Qualifications  Authority  of Ireland  
(NQAI). From a farming  perspective  the following  placements  are planned;
Table  4. On-Farm  Placements  - Agricultural  Courses
Course Placement  Duration
Vocational  Cert, in Agriculture  -'Level  2'
(1 year  Agricultural  College,  2 years  local option)1 month

Teagasc/FAB  Pig course i2 years  x 12 months
National  Certificate  in Agriculture i3 months
(HETAC  Course  - CAO application)
Much more  can be done  to promote  farming  careers.  The existing  training  agencies  are 
well aware  of this and steps are being taken to increase  awareness  and promotional  
activity  among  secondary  school  students.  Farmers  can play an important  practical  role 
in this. Farmer/employers  can also do much  more  to improve  the image  of farming  and 
provide  better  working  conditions.  The challenge  to the industry  is to sell careers  and 
highlight  the type of employment  opportunities  which exist in farming.  We must also 
push to develop  careers  not just jobs and create  opportunities  for young  people  to move  
up the farming  ladder.
Family  Labour  Pool
Traditionally  the family  provided  the 'labour  on the doorstep'.  There  is strong  evidence  
now that children  of farmers  are turning  away  from farming.  To some  degree  we have  
'educated  young  people  away  from farming'.  They  are opting  for a college  life and non
123
farming  careers  - many  from large commercial  farms. Some  of the young  people  who 
do enter  farming  become  frustrated  with the lack of progress,  poor involvement  in the 
business,  poor satisfaction  and rewards.  These  are voting  with their  feet and leaving  for 
off-farm  jobs and other  careers.
These  problems/issues  can be tackled. Part of the problem  is the low involvement  of 
family  children  in the farm work. Perhaps:
sons/daughters  of farmers  need to get their hands  dirty again  - at an early age?
• project  a more positive  image  of farming  and farming  jobs.
• provide  proper  training  and work experience  for entrants.
• give responsibility  where  it is earned/deserved.
• involve  in decision  making  and management  at an early stage.
• provide  satisfactory/attractive  working  environment.
• labour  efficient  facilities  with a good balance  between  work and relaxation.
• further  and continuous  training  - formal  courses,  Macra,  discussions  groups  etc.
• social  freedom  for 16 to 22 year olds and older is essential  to counter  some  of the 
attractions  of city/town  life.
'Surplus ’ family  labour
The CSO data show that the majority  of the farm labour  force work less then one (1) 
annual work unit (1800 hours per annum)  in farming. In 1999, 142,900  people  
contributed  less than 1800 hours  work in the year  - 53% of the total people  engaged  in 
agriculture.  89,100  worked  less than half of a work unit (900 hours)  or one third (33%)  
of the total work force. It is well known  that many  of these people  are engaged  in off- 
farm employment  and are doing so in increasing  numbers.  Nevertheless,  I believe  this 
identifies  an important  potential  source  of farm labour. It seems  logical  that a farmer  
with spare  time would  work at what he or she knows  best - farming.  New skills can be 
developed  through  training.  These  were and are still are an obvious  pool of people  for 
the Farm Relief  Services.  Why  did relatively  small  numbers  of these  farmers  (with spare  
capacity)  participate  or seek employment  with FRS over the years? Was it the farming  
image?  Job conditions  (pay, hours,  type of work)?  Attractiveness  of other  jobs/careers?  
Competition  from other  sectors  again  is a key factor. I feel the Farm Relief  Services  are 
on the right track by recruiting  part-time  farmers  to deliver  a service  (such as fertiliser  
spreading)  rather than pure ‘labour ’. With the right promotion,  improved  work  
environment  on farms  and better  working  conditions  it should  be possible  to recruit  more 
of these  people  on (commercial)  farms  that need labour. Look at contracting  out the job 
not hiring  staff.
Foreign  Workers/Students.
Due to the continuing  labour  scarcity  foreign  workers  have been sourced  by agencies.  
Farm Relief  Services  and by individual  farmers.  The Farm  Apprenticeship  Board has 
become  involved  too - operating  an Exchange  Training  Programme  for students  mainly  
from Eastern  European  Countries  placing  up to 25 students  on farms.  The data in Table
124
5 show the increasing  number  of immigrants  being granted  work permits  in Ireland.

The data show  that Ireland  is now a country  with strong  immigration.  Information  on the 
type of work been taken up by immigrants  in the agricultural  sector  is not available.  
However, evidence  and experience  on the ground suggests  that most of these  
mmigrants  are working  in the horticultural/mushroom/vegetables  areas. Foreign  
,workers  from Latvia, Ukraine,  Russia  etc. have shown  a keen willingness  to work in 
■epetitive  like jobs and generally  have a high work ethic. To date the students  handled  
kyFAB have been very successful  at farm level. Language  (with exceptions),  is not a 
iroblem.
The Farm Relief  Services  places  250-300  foreign  people  on farms  per year. While  the 
lumber  of farms  with foreign  workers  is increasing  they will not provide  the sole solution  
tthe labour  problem.  These  workers  too will have a tendency  to follow  better-paid  jobs.  
The better employers  will be more successful  at attracting  and retaining  farm staff 
respective  of where  they are from.  Nevertheless  foreign  workers  have  and will become  
ill increasingly  important  source  of farm labour. Training  and language  courses  need 
10 be provided  for this group  as they grow in importance.  Obviously  proper  selection  is 
Jtical to success. Proper  handling  (management)  of the individuals  by the farmer  
mployers  is equally  crucial.
I
itort of labour?
ncreasing  the supply  of labour  is only part of the solution.  The other is to reduce  the 
abour required  to operate  and manage  your farm business.  The steps involved  are 
jimmarised  above  at No.5 when  discussing  the Family  Labour  Pool.
■armers  need to stand back, take stock of their businesses  and analyse  where  labour  
avings can be made. In many situations  this can be achieved  without  any economic  
j(ss, in many  cases  economic  advantages  may accrue  because  more  time is spent  on 
panagement  and high reward  activities.  Central  to this approach  is the use of contract  
labour and/or contract  services. Off load work where you can. As stated earlier  
leighbouring  farmers  with .time on their hands, could provide  a useful service  - 
especially  at peak seasonal  times (spreading  fertiliser  at calving,  feeding,  fencing,  
ashing,  slurry  spreading,  silage  etc ). Look at options  like contract  rearing  of calves,  
itcalf heifers,  off wintering  dry stock  etc. The cost of labour  saved  may make  many  of 
bese options  economically  viable. A well run highly  efficient  contractor  service  should  
ieused  to the maximum.

Training  in the Future
All courses  in agriculture,  horticulture  and related  areas  will in future  be accredited  by 
the National  Qualifications  Authority  of Ireland  (NQAI).  The NQAI has responsibility  for 
guaranteeing  the quality  of education  and training  and promoting  access,  transfer  and 
progression  into and within  education  and training.  The Authority  will be putting  in place  
policies  to help students  move  between  courses  and colleges  and developing  a national  
framework  of qualifications.  Two councils  will be established  to carry  out these  functions  
for the NQAI. The further  Education  and Training  Awards  Council  - FETAC  - will have 
responsibility  for what we generally  call ‘Vocational  Training ’ at present  and will absorb  
the functions  of a number  of providers  in this area including  Teagasc.
The Higher  Education  and Training  Awards  Council  -HETAC  - will be responsible  for all 
higher  education  and training  courses  excluding  Universities.  HETAC  incorporates  the 
functions  of the National  Council  for Education  Awards  (NCEA).  For the first time some  
mainstream  courses  in agriculture  and horticulture  will come under  the remit of Higher  
Education.  Applications  for HETAC  courses  will be made  though  the CAO system.  The 
new format  will also provide  a ‘Higher  Education  Links  System ’,and will allow  holders  of 
FETAC  (vocational)  awards  transfer  to the Higher  Education  Courses  under  HETAC  and 
allow holders  of Awards  at Certificate  level in HETAC  courses  progress  to higher  levels  
- up to Diploma  and Degree  level. This is a very significant  development  in the area of 
vocational  education  and training  in agriculture.  It removes  what many  saw as a barrier  
to recruitment  into agricultural  training  and education  courses.  It is hoped  that this will 
help recruit  extra people  into courses  leading  to careers  in agriculture.  This new format  
will commence  in September  2001.
What will this mean for the education  and training  of people  in and for agriculture,  
horticulture,  etc.? For simplicity  I will confine  my remarks  to training  and education  in 
agriculture  (farming)  - the area of most interest  to this association.  The Certificate  in 
Farming  or Green Cert, programme  is now replaced  by the National  Vocational  
Certificate  in Agriculture.  This will be available  in two phases  and be operated  by 
Teagasc  under  FETAC;
Phase  1 - a one year  course  conducted  full time at an Agricultural  College  or a two year 
course  if conducted  part time at a local Teagasc  Centre.
This phase will include  four weeks on farm placement  and ‘specialisation ’ will be 
possible.  Successful  participants  will be awarded  a National  Vocational  Certificate  in 
Agriculture  Level 2 (subject  to confirmation).
Phase  3 - Entry  will be confined  to holders  of a “Level 2 Certificate ”. It will consist  of a 
further  year ’s training  consisting  of 36 weeks  on farm placement  and up to 8 weeks  
course  work. A National  Vocational  Certificate  in Agriculture  Level 3 (subject  to 
confirmation)  will be awarded  to successful  participants.
Variations  of the above  will exist for those  returning  to farm part time in the future  and 
for Horticulture,  Forestry,  Horses.
126
New CAO Listed  Course
Teagasc  has established  and got HETAC  approval/accreditation  for a new course  listed 
on the CAO System  for the first time last January.  This course  will consist  of two years  
of course  work incorporating  a mix of science  and business  with farm husbandry  and 
management  topics. It will include  12 weeks  on farm placement  in the second  year.  
This course  will be offered  by a number  of Agricultural  Colleges  in co-operation  with 
adjacent  Institutes  of Technology.  225 CAO applicants  listed the Agriculture  Course  as 
their first preference  so it is possible  that 70 - 80 young  people  will enrol in this course  
(in three centres)  for 200/2001.  The course  will lead to a National  Certificate  in 
agriculture  awarded  by HETAC. It is expected  that an application  for a third year of 
course  work leading  to a National  Diploma  in Agriculture  will be approved  in the near 
future.
Further  Training:
Further  training  or ‘in-service ’ training  for those engaged  in farming  is equally  as 
important  as young  entrant  training  dealt  within  the previous  section.  Every  business  is 
dependent  on the capabilities  and skills of its workforce.  Continuous  updating  of 
knowledge,  skills and management  and the acquisition  of new skills (e.g. time 
management,  grass budgeting,  labour management)  are essential  to the continued  
success  of your business.
How can farmers  organise  such in-service  training  for themselves  and their  staff?  
Farmers  have shown and continue  to show that they can achieve  a lot by working  
together  and organising  ways of achieving  their goals. Discussion  groups  are an 
excellent  example  of this. They have become  a highly significant  element  in adult  
training. This format  can and should  also be used for existing  farm labour. In many  
areas of training  what is required  is organisation  not facilities.  That said farmers  should  
look to using the facilities  in our agricultural  colleges  - especially  as there is spare  
capacity  due to falling  numbers.  Colleges  could play a major  role in providing  courses  
in the skills (milking,  calving,  calf rearing,  grassland,  office management  etc.) and the 
business  side of farming.
Farmers  should,  and I believe  will pay for the cost of such in-service  training.  Training  
offers another  way of improving  labour  efficiency  and thus is an additional  ‘source ’ of 
labour.

efficiency

Introduction
Agricultural  management  and employment  has undergone  significant  change  in recent  
years. Total labour  force  decreased  from 324,300  in 1992  to 269,900  in 1999;  a decline  
of 16.7%  or an annual  decline  o^ 2.4%  (Frawley,  2000). In terms  of the national  labour  
force,  agriculture  accounted  for 8 % in 1999, compared  with 13% in 1992 - a drop of 5 
%. The decline  in farm workers  (other  family  workers  and non-family  workers)  was 
double  that of farm holders  between  1992 and 1999 (22.7%  and 10.8%). To a large 
extent,  the impact  of labour  shortage  has successfully  been overcome  by increased  
productivity  of the retained  workforce.  In New Zealand,  economic  pressures  in the daily 
sector  influenced  the need to develop  ways of increasing  productivity,  e.g. increased  
number  of cows to be milked  per person  per hour (Watkins,  2001). Nevertheless,  the 
opportunity  to further  enhance  labour productivity  poses a strong challenge,  given 
increasing  costs  and varying  characteristics  of the available  labour.
Causative  factors
The change  in individual  profiles  within agriculture  is a complex  issue comprising  a 
number  of interrelated  circumstances.  The process  of economic  transformation  and 
rapid development  of the non- agricultural  sector  has had a significant  influence.  The 
direct  involvement  of women  on dairy farms  has decreased,  as they are now retaining  
and/or  seeking  careers  off-farm.  A decline  in the number  of children  returning  to work 
on the home  farm after leaving  school  has also placed  pressure  on labour  requirements  
(Reid, 1997). In parallel  with the increased  demand  for labour,  there  has been a decline  
in the number  of people  seeking  farm work in the dairy sector. This is due in part to the 
low level of unemployment  in recent  years,  enabling  job seekers  the opportunity  to be 
more selective  in the employment  they accept. The current  expectations  of young  
people  are for increased  social  activity,  flexible  time off, competitive  wages  and access  
to the attractions  of urban centres. Today,  dairy farming  is seen by many as a less 
attractive  career  option  than other  forms  of employment.
Outlook
The consensus  is that there is unlikely  to be any improvement  in the supply  of 
agricultural  labour  in the near future. In the context  of future  sustained  growth  in Irish 
agriculture,  the role of farm labour  will become  increasingly  critical.
Corrective  action  - general  terms  
Technological  adjustment
Labour  saving  and augmenting  strategies  are necessary  if Irish agriculture  is to remain
128
competitive.  Such strategies  should  focus on finding  alternative,  and economically  
viable, labour saving and labour replacing  devices. For some, improved  labour  
efficiency  and reduced  stress will lie in the adoption  of automated  technology  (e.g. 
installation  of a high technology  dairy). However,  cost is often seen as a major  obstacle  
together  with concerns  about  the reliability  of a complex,  electronically  operated  system  
(Clarke,  1998). Mechanisation  will not be a viable  proposition  until its potential  benefits  
are proven  to be greater  than its cost. Also, mechanisation  must be appropriate  and 
readily  adapted  for use by a majority  of farmers.
Structural  adjustment
Structural  adjustments  including  the use of contract  labour may suit some farms,  
however  this has a number  of important  implications.  This type of labour  is transient  in 
nature, potentially  making it an unreliable.  Contract  work arrangements  may be 
successful,  but much is dependent  on the quality  of the contract  worker  as well as other  
factors  in the farm labour  market.
Image
Farming  in general  needs to be seen as an attractive  career  opportunity  for farm 
workers  employed  in family  farm units, as well as in the largest  corporate  commercial  
farms. Dairy  farming  is often portrayed  as having  a negative  image,  which  is not found  
jin many non-agricultural  business  or career  opportunities.
Corrective  action  - specific  targets  
Enhance  research  and development
The situation  requires  the development  of processes  that enable  issues  of research  and 
development  to be monitored  and managed  at an industry,  regional  and individual  farm 
tevel. Ireland  lacks  data and research  on human  resource  use on dairy  farms. Farmers  
jmust critically  examine  and measure  their labour  use on the farm. What  gets measured  
Ijets managed!  Benchmarking  is the process  of comparing  measures  or indicators  for 
tie farm, with those of other farms having similar  farming  systems. This allows  
jidentification  of best practices  and areas for potential  improvement  necessary  to 
jachieve  the best results  (Leslie  and Miller, 1999). The farmer  may be able to improve  
tibour use through  revision  of the current  farming  system,  and/or  by spending  money  
on capital  improvement  on the farm.
Current  research
The present  shortage  of available  labour  is unlikely  to be reversed  in the short  term,  and 
iiltinnately  brings about a need to utilise what will be a smaller  pool of labour  more  
efficiently  and effectively.  To address  this issue, a study on labour  use on dairy farms  
iias been put in place in the Dairy Production  Research  Centre  at Moorepark.  Part of 
iis study is associated  with a PhD degree  programme  of one of the authors,  in 
tonjunction  with UCD, under  a Walsh  Fellowship.  The database  of labour  use on dairy  
farms is still undergoing  statistical  analysis.  Some  of the initial findings  from the study  
are presented  in this paper.

Objective
To develop  a blueprint  for efficient  labour  use on commercial  dairy farms,  which has 
been  tested  and been shown  to reduce  the labour  requirement,  whilst  being  acceptable  
in terms  of milk quality  standards,  the environment,  animal  welfare,  and staff working  
conditions.

5.Analysis  of current  labour  use on dairy  farms
Following  a 12-month  data collection  process  the labour  requirement  for the various  
farm tasks  will be quantified.  Areas  of high labour  demand  will be identified,  as will 
the farms  on which  they are most prevalent.
Benchmarks
Benchmarks  will be established  based on the performance  of the more efficient  
farms
Planning  and implementing  change
Changes  (proposed  labour  saving  practices/investments,  changes  to farm and work 
routines)  to the existing  system  will be introduced  on a selected  number  of farms.  
Analysis  and control
The effect  of the changes  will be measured  and analysed  in financial,  physical  and 
human  terms
Design  of blueprints  for ‘best  practice ’
Changes  identified  as having  a positive  effect  on the efficiency,  sustainability  or user 
friendliness  of the system  will be incorporated  into labour-use  blueprints.  These  
blueprints  will aim to reduce  labour  costs and allow for future expansion  while 
complying  with standards  and other  current  regulations.
Design  and methods
A population  of 138 farms co-operated  in the study, which commenced  in February,  
2000. These ranged  in quota size from 30,000  to 310,000  gallons. Two sets of 
measurements  were required:  (I) The time taken to carry out the identified  farm tasks 
and (2) a description  of the farm infrastructure,  i.e. the routines  and procedures  carried  
out on the farm together  with facilities  and layout  on the farm and a profile  of the farm 
personnel.
Time recording  of tasks  
A system  was set in place  whereby  each of the farm tasks (total 28) would  be defined
and the amount  of time devoted  to each one was recorded.
Method  1. The Timesheet
The timesheet  was designed  as a user-friendly  method of measuring  the time
consumed  by the various  farm tasks. The participant  farms  completed  the sheets  for a 
consecutive  three-day  period once per month. Completing  the sheets involved  
recording  the time consumed  by each task on a daily basis. Therefore  one sheet  was 
distributed  per farm covering  all tasks and persons.  Time off between  the farm tasks
130
was not recorded.
Method  2. The Psion  Organiser
The Psion  Organiser  is a hand held personal  organiser,  on which  the operator  recorded  
the time that each task consumed  and the time of day that the task took place. The 
length of the farmer ’s day was visible,  as was the proportion  of time-off  within the 
working  day. The recording  period  on these  farms  was a five-day  slot per month. An 
individual  organiser  was required  for each labour  person  on the farm.
Questionnaires : Farm  infrastructure
Questionnaires  were completed  by farmers  on farm practices  relating  to feeding  and 
cleaning  associated  with winter  housing,  calf rearing,  the milking  process  (including  
parlour  type and on farm fragmentation  relating  to blocks  of land) and on Farm Profile.
Results  to-date
Net labour  input  for tasks
The average  net labour  input per day over a 12-month  period  (68 farms  for which  data 
was available  for all months)  is shown  in Figure  1. This represents  the cumulative  net 
labour  input per day (may include  more than one labour  unit on a farm) for herds  with 
an average  quota of 91 K gallons  and average  herd size of 78. Net labour  input on 
these farms peaked  at 12.9 h in March  and gradually  declined  to 8.3 h in December.  
This data represents  the net labour  input per day (excluding  mealtimes,  etc). Therefore  
the length of the total working  day is substantially  longer than this. When time 
associated  with enterprises  other  than dairying  was excluded,  the average  net labour  
input per day associated  with dairying  decreased  from 11.5 h in March to 7 h in 
December.  The time associated  with enterprises  other  than dairying  was increased  for 
small quota  holders,  since  that group  operate  other  enterprises  to a greater  degree  than 
large quota  holders.

Over the 12 month period, net labour associated  with tasks related to dairying  
comprised  the milking  process  - 33 %, maintenance  - 15 %, grassland  management - 
11 %, office  - 11 %, calving  and calf care - 7 %, feeding  cows - 7 %, cleaning  yards  
and houses  - 5 %, fertility  - 4 % and miscellaneous  - 7 % (Figure  2). While  net labour  
associated  with many of these individual  component  tasks did not constitute  a 
significant  portion  of total net labour  (most  tasks  took less than 12 % of total net labour),  
they created  labour  peaks  at various  periods  of the year (Figure  3). Time associated  
with the milking  process  was approximately  3.9 h per day, except  during the winter  
period,  when it was reduced  to approximately  1.8 h per day. Time consumed  by 
grassland  management  was at a maximum  at 2.1, 1.8 and 2.0 h per day during  June,  
July and August,  respectively.  The greater  portion  of time consumed  by calving  and calf 
care at an average  of 1.9 h per day occurred  during  February,  March  and April. Time 
associated  with feeding  cows was at a maximum  of 1.4 h between  November  and 
February.  By targeting  these  four tasks (the milking  process,  grassland  management,  
calving  and calf care and cow feeding)  for labour  efficiency  (reduced  labour  input),  total 
net input of labour  in each month  over the 12 months  (Figure  1) could be reduced,  and 
the peak labour  demand  observed  in March  might  also be reduced.

process
The milking  process
Many  dairy  farmers  spend  several  hours  milking  in systems  designed  to cope  with herds  
of half the current  size. Milking  is generally  seen as psychologically  and physically  
stressful.  The milking  process  has adopted  a production  line approach  but often with 
only one person  on the line, and that person  is required  to have expertise  in several  
tasks. Since the milking  process  represents  an average  of 3.9 h of labour  per day 
between  March and November,  it is appropriate  to investigate  existing  obstacles  or 
limitations  to efficient  milking  and to suggest  some modifications  or changes,  which  
would reduce  this time.
Focus  on the milking  process  and component  tasks
The milking  process  (for the purpose  of this paper)  is defined  as herding  time (bringing  
cows from paddock  to milking  parlour  and returning  cows  to paddock)  plus milking  time 
(clusters  on/off)  plus washing  time (machine  and yard) (Figure  4). The milking  process  
was investigated  for the month  of June, since all cows of spring calving  herds were  
milking at this time. In studying  the milking process,  spring-calved  herds were  
categorised  according  to milk quota  size (30 to 55 [29 herds],  55 to 70 [32 herds],  70 to 
110 [28 herds]  and 110 to 320 K gallons  [25 herds]).
Time spent at the milking  process  as a proportion  of the net labour  input per day, for 
different  quota  categories,  is shown  in Table  1. The spring  calved  herds  within  the study,  
with quota  ranging  from 30 to 110 K gallons  spent  between  3.3 and 3.8 h at the milking  
process,  which  represented  32 to 34 % of the net labour  input per day. Herds  of quota  
category  110 to 320 K gallons  spent  5.6 h at the milking  process,  representing  38 % of 
the net labour  input per day.

Time spent  at herding,  milking  and washing,  by spring  calved  herds  in each of the quota  
categories,  30 to 55, 55 to 70, 70 to 110 and 110 to 320 K gallons  were studied.  
Considerable  variation  in time spent at herding,  milking  and washing  was observed  
within each of the quota categories.  The least efficient  25 % of herds within quota  
categories  30 to 55, 55 to 70, 70 to 110 and 110 to 320 K gallons  took an average  of 53, 
66, 68 and 107 min for herding,  respectively.  The most efficient  25 % of herds  within  
the same  quota  categories  took 19, 26, 25 and 34 min for herding  (Table  2). The least 
efficient  25 % of herds  within  the quota  categories  had a milk throughput  of 78,120,127  
and 141 gal/h,  while  the most  efficient  25 % had a milk throughput  of 152, 198, 216 and 
343 gal/h, respectively  (Table  3). A similar  variation  in efficiency  within  quota  categories  
was observed  for washing  times (Table  4). This indicated  that quota size was not the 
major determining  factor in labour input to the milking process.  Significant  
improvements  are possible  within  each quota  category.

Factors  affecting  milking  process  efficiency
A range of characteristics  considered  to be relevant  to times associated  with herding,  
milking  and washing  were investigated,  to establish  the specific  characteristics,  which  
influenced  the time taken  for each of these  tasks. This  was achieved  by identifying  least  
efficient,  medium  efficient  and most  efficient  herds  at each milking  task (herding,  milking
135
and washing)  and investigating  the frequency  of occurrence  of specific  characteristics  
among  those herds.
The spring-calved  herds in the milk quota ranges  (30 to 55 [29 herds],  55 to 70 [32 
herds]  and 70 to 110 [28 herds] K gallons  were used as one group, since the least 
efficient,  medium  efficient  and most efficient  portions  of these quota categories,  
respectively,  were similar  in their average  times  spent  at the milking  tasks (Tables  2, 3 
and 4). The herds in the milk quota range 110 to 320 K gallons  were excluded  in this 
analysis,  since  they were recognised  as a more diverse  group  (large  quota range)  and 
that average  times taken for the milking  tasks by herds in this quota category  were 
considerably  different  to those  taken by herds  in the other  three quota  categories.
Herding
Eighty-five  spring-calved  herds  (for which  all data was available)  ranging  in quota  size 
from 30 to 110 K gallons  were categorised  into three groups  comprising  28, 29 and 28 
herds, respectively,  based on time taken for herding. These  groups  represented  the 
least efficient,  medium  efficient  and most efficient  herds. Milk quota  and cow number  
ranged  from 57.8 to 66.1 K (average  63.2) gallons,  and from 52 to 61, (average  57), 
respectively,  across  the three groups. Average  time for herding  for these groups  was 
73, 48 and 31 min per day, respectively.  The factors  investigated  for their impact  on 
herding  efficiency  included  fragmentation  of grazing  area, the possibility  of cows going  
directly  to paddocks  after milking,  frequency  of fresh grass allocation  and drover  
transport.  The relative  importance  of each of these  factors  to minimising  herding  time 
is shown  in Table  5. Forty-three  and seventy-nine  percent  of herds  in the least and most 
efficient  groups,  respectively  had the grazing  area in one block. This resulted  in the 
possibility  of cows going directly  to paddocks  in a large proportion  (79 %) of the most 
efficient  herds  compared  to the least efficient  herds  (39 %). Allocation  of fresh grass  on 
a twice-daily  basis occurred  on 71 % and 50 % of least and most efficient  herds,  
respectively.

Milking
Seventy-five  spring-calved  herds  (for which  all data was available)  ranging  in quota  size 
from 30 to 110 K gallons  were categorised  into three  groups  each comprising  25 herds, 
based  on time taken for milking  (clusters  on/off). These  groups  represented  the least  
efficient,  medium  efficient  and most efficient  herds. Milk quota  and cow number  ranged  
from 59.0 to 64.5 K (average  61.9)  gallons  and from 53 to 61, (average  57), respectively,  
across  the three  groups.  Average  time taken  for milking  these  groups  was 2.7, 2.1 and 
1.7 h per day, respectively.  The factors  investigated  for their impact  on efficiency  
included  the number  of cows milked  per unit, the milking  facility,  teat preparation  and 
disinfection  procedure,  feeding  method,  cow collection  and cow movement.  The relative  
importance  of each of these factors  to minimising  herding  time is shown  in Table 6. 
Sixty-eight and  eight  percent  of herds  in the least  and most  efficient  groups,  respectively  
had a cowiunit  ratio greater  than 7. The frequency  of cows  entering  the parlour  through  
doorways  was halved  (56 to 28 %) in the most efficient  compared  to the least efficient  
herds. The proportion  of herds  having  exit gates  operated  from any point in the pit was 
more than doubled  (30 to 68 %) in the most efficient  compared  to the least efficient  
herds. The 3'0” (0.91 m) herringbone  parlour  and manual  feeding  systems  occurred  
more frequently  in the least efficient  compared  to the most efficient  herds. Teat 
preparation  did not influence  time for milking  in this situation,  since most herds in the 
overall  group  of 75 used similar  procedures.  A higher  proportion  of herds had foremilk  
drawn  in the least (44 %) compared  to the most  efficient  (24 %) herds. Teat disinfection  
was used by the majority  of herds  in all three  groups.

Washing
Eighty-five  spring-calved  herds  (for which  all data was available)  ranging  in quota  size 
from 30 to 110 K gallons  were categorised  into three groups  comprising  28, 29 and 28 
herds,  respectively,  based  on time taken for washing.  These  groups  represented  the 
least efficient,  medium  efficient  and most efficient  herds. Milk quota  and cow number  
ranged  from 59.1 to 65.3 K (average  63.2) gallons  and from 57 to 58, (average  57), 
respectively,  across  the three groups.  Average  time for washing  for these  groups  was 
54, 33 and 22 min per day, respectively.  The factors  investigated  for their impact  on 
washing  efficiency  included  the use of detergent  in machine-washing  on a twice-daily  
basis, the method  and frequency  of yard cleaning,  the area of yard requiring  cleaning 
and the possibility  for cows to go directly  to paddocks  after milking. The relative  
importance  of each of these factors  to minimising  herding  time is shown  in Table 7. 
Thirty-nine  and twenty-one  percent  of herds in the least and most efficient  groups,  
respectively,  cleaned  the yard twice  daily. Sixty-three  and seventy-nine  percent  of herds  
in the same  groups  had a yard area (which  required  cleaning)  of less than 100 m^. Fifty 
percent  of herds  in the most  efficient  group  cleaned  yards  by using  a hand  scraper, while  
thirty-nine  percent  in the least efficient  group  used this method.  However,  this may be 
associated  with yard size. Cows  were  able to go directly  to paddocks  after milking  in 57 
and 68 % of farms  in the least and most efficient  groups.

Discussion
The layout  of the grazing  area in one block (not crossing  public roadways)  and the 
possibility  for cows to go directly  to paddocks  after milking were the two major 
influencing  factors  in reducing  time spent  at herding  cows. While  fragmentation  of the 
grazing  area is unavoidable  on a number  of farms,  there are some instances  where,  
non-dairy  cows are grazing  or maize/silage  is adjacent  to the parlour,  and cows are 
being  transferred  across  the public  road for milking.  This practise  requires  extra labour  
units. The blocks  of land adjacent  to the parlour  should  be confined,  where  possible,  
for the milking  herd. The allocation  of fresh grass  at each milking  may not be very time 
consuming  if the paddocks  are well laid out. This task took 16 and 5 min per day by the
138
least and most  efficient  groups  in the above  comparison.  However,  it would  be possible  
to improve  time efficiency  by allocating  grass on a 24 h basis instead  of a 12 h basis, 
while ensuring  that the allocation  was sufficient  and weather  conditions  were not critical.  
Mechanised  transport  used by the drover  did not influence  herding  times in a positive  
manner.  This may be due to the fact that this type of transport  existed  more  frequently  
on farms with fragmented  grazing  areas. The length,  width and surface  condition  of 
roadways  may have  a significant  effect  on herding  time. However,  data to examine  this 
issue is not available  so far.
The data  on milking  times  indicated  that the number  of cows  milked  per unit had a major  
impact  on the milking  time. The number  of milking  units is inadequate  in many  parlours,  
particularly  when cows are at peak production.  The current  data also suggests  that 
cows should  not be required  to pass through  narrow  doorways.  Narrow  doors  at the 
entrance  to the parlour  restrict  cow flow and limit throughput.  Covering  the collecting  
yard would  eliminate  the need  for narrow  entrance  doors. Drawing  of foremilk  may have  
a negative  impact  on milking  time. However,  the drawing  of foremilk  is a necessary  
requirement  according  to the EC Dairy Hygiene  Standards  and is therefore  not an 
optional  practice  in relation  to time saving  at milking. The data suggested  that the 
presence  of exit gates operated  from any point in the pit would  reduce  overall  milking  
time. The advantages  of these exits might be more pronounced  in larger parlours.  
Backing  gates,  entry  gates  and drafting  facilities  operated  from the pit are likely  to have  
a similar  effect  (as time saving  devices)  on milking  time. It was not possible  to deduce  
this from the data presented  in this paper,  since the occurrence  of these devices  was 
very low in all three  categories  of herds. The presence  of these  devices  would  probably  
eliminate  the need for the milker  to leave the pit at any time during  milking. Milking  
systems  in the future  should  be geared  towards  a one-person  operation.  The overall  
objective  is to harvest  the maximum  volume  of milk with the least amount  of labour, 
under  the least stressful  conditions  for the person  and cow.
The size of the yard area to be cleaned  and frequency  of yard cleaning  were the two 
major influencing  factors  in reducing  time spent at washing.  The reduced  size of the 
yard area to be cleaned,  in the more efficient  herds  may be due to a greater  proportion  
of the yard being slatted. Reduced  cleaning  frequency  may reduce  time taken for 
washing. However,  it must be ensured  that a high standard  of cleanliness  be 
maintained.  The possibility  for cows  to go directly  to paddocks  after  milking  and not wait 
in the yard also had a positive  effect  on washing  time. Hand  or hand-assisted  cleaning  
of the yard did not influence  herding  times  in a negative  manner  (the most  efficient  group  
at washing  included  a slightly  higher  proportion  of those  cleaning  by hand compared  to 
the medium  and least efficient  groups).  This may be due to the fact that this method  of 
deaning  is more  frequent  on smaller  yard areas. The impact  of frequency  of detergent  
use and channels  for taking  water  while washing  yards  was not evident,  since a high 
proportion  of herds  in all three categories  had these  features.
Summary
Indications  from the initial analysis  of this data on the milking  process  suggests  that the 
main time-escalating  element  of herding  was the fragmentation  of the cow grazing  area 
(involves  crossing  public roads) and the associated  inability  to let cows back to
139
paddocks  directly  after milking. This may be avoided  in some instances  by removing  
non-dairy  cows/silage  etc. to areas  less convenient  to the parlour  and having  the dairy 
cows adjacent  to the parlour. The impact  of roadways  has yet to be determined.  The 
main time escalating  elements  of milking  were the inadequate  number  of milking  units,  
the difficulty  for cows  in accessing  the milking  parlour  through  narrow  doorways  and the 
fact that in many  cases  the exit gates could not be operated  from any point in the pit. 
Thus, upgrading  of many parlours  in respect  to these characteristics  is required.  The 
main time escalating  elements  of washing  were increased  size of yard area to be 
cleaned  and twice daily cleaning.  This situation  may be improved  by increasing  the 
slatted  area of the yard.

Labour  Efficiency  on our Farm
TOM DUNNE
Downing,  Kilworth,  Fermoy,  Co Cork
Introduction
As participants  in the Moorepark  Labour  survey,  being involved  in an alternative  farm 
enterprise,  and enduring  the Foot and Mouth  scare,  our minds  have been focused  more  
than ever on Labour  Efficiency  on our farm.
What is Labour  efficiency  and how do we get it? Some people  think that if we run 
instead  of walk we will be more efficient. Others  think machines  will lead us to the 
promised  land. Some  say planning  and organisation  will deliver  the goods.  All of these  
delivered  in the package  of a system  that suits your circumstances  are perhaps  the 
answer.  What  suits my farm situation  may not suit yours,  therefore  we must be flexible.  
The system  we choose  will impact  on our family  lives, dictate  our working  conditions  and 
how attractive  our farms  will be for future  generations.
Farm Structure
It’s a family  farm partnership.  There  are three  families  in the partnership.  Each family  
supplies  a labour  unit. There is no hired labour  on the farm. A new agri-tourism  
business  is run in parallel  with the farm. This business  has a separate  manager.  One 
of the partners  spends  up to 50% of his time working  on this enterprise  while  the others  
help during  the peak season.
The Farm
The farm is made up of 300 acres (owned  and leased). Stock  comprises  185 milking  
cows, cull cows, replacements  and beef. The farm is stocked  at 1 LU/ac. The farm is 
in seven separate  blocks. Five of these areas are available  to the milking  cows for 
grazing  at 0.7 acres per cow. Milking  cows need to cross the road more than 50% of 
the time morning  and evening.  Contractors  cut the silage  and this year also spread  the 
fertiliser  from May onwards.  The partners  including  DIY Al do all other  work.
The milking  machine  is a sixteen  unit side by side with 2’2” standings.  It’s a basic  
machine  with no extras. The output  is 140 - 150 cows  per hour at peak. The entry and 
exit gates  and head rail is operated  by compressed  air. One or two people  milk the cows  
depending  on the time of year and the availability  of labour.
In Search  of Labour  Efficiency
Labour  efficiency  should  not be an end in itself. It must always  be in the context  of a 
profitable  business.  Time spent on the farm could be reduced  by the purchase  of 
expensive  machinery,  but it might  not be profitable  to do so. This means  that the system  
employed  to achieve  our farm production  is the most critical  factor  in relation  to labour  
efficiency.  As managers  of a business  we must constantly  question  why we do things  
in a certain  way and then perhaps  why we do them at all. An example  of this is the 
decision  taken not to wash the cows before  milking.  This was unthinkable  some  years
141
ago but experience  has shown  that it makes  absolutely  no ditference  to milk quality  and 
is perhaps  better  for the cow’s udder  health. On the farm we try to operate  a system  
that is simple,  low cost, and repeatable  from year to year if possible.  We try to learn by 
our mistakes.
Critical  Matters
On any dairy farm what are the critical things  from season  to season? The most 
important  factor  in a spring  calving  herd is that the cows calve compactly  each spring.  
This is the key to managing  labour. Calve  in a block, breed in a block  and dry off in a 
block. We usually  dry all the cows on the same day. You have very heavy  bursts  of 
work, you can focus  on one job at a time, and for this reason  you are likely to get better 
results.  Calving  begins  for the heifers  the first week  in February,  the cows  mid-February.  
The bulk of the cows  are calved  by mid-April.  Breeding  this year began  on May 12>'’ for 
the cows,  and May 8'^' for the heifers.  Angus  bulls run with the Fleifers.  DIY Al was used 
for 20 days  on the cows  during  which  85% of the herd was bred. Angus  bulls  were  then 
run with the herd. This system  will result (all things being equal) with around  50 
replacement  heifer calves  being born. We usually  keep 40 - 45 replacement  heifer 
calves.
Breeding
Because  we consider  compact  calving  to be vital and as the Holstein  bulls available  
have poor and worsening  fertility  for themselves  and their daughters,  we are using 
crossbreeding  in our herd. We have used small numbers  of Rotbunt  and Norwegian  
Red over recent  years. A large number  of Swedish  reds were used last year, resulting  
in 23 SRB heifer  calves,  accounting  for half of our replacements  for that year. All the 
cows bred to Al this year had SRB used on them. The hope is to breed a more 
functional  cow with better  fertility,  better  legs and feet. A more compact  animal  with 
better  conformation  is the goal. Also hybrid  vigour  should  lead to a more  efficient  animal  
feed wise. A cow that goes and stays in calf, has no lameness,  less mastitis  and 
generally  better  health  requires  less labour. A herd  of cows  like this should  require  a lot 
less labour. Time will tell whether  the SRB's  will deliver  this.
Management  Practices
As cows  calve  they go to  grass  day and night  and do not come  back into the sheds.  The 
labour  saved  with this practice  needs  no explanation.  Feeding  late in the evening  is also 
practised  to discourage  night calving  and has worked  very well. The spreading  of 
fertiliser  by contractor  has been very successful,  the cost is competitive,  and it has 
relieved  us of the work at critical  times. Up to four years  ago we cut our own silage,  but 
lack of manpower  has made  it impossible  to continue  with this strategy  (it would  still be 
cheaper  to cut the silage  ourselves).  Covering  the pit is now the only labour  required  
on our part at silage  time.
Investment  in a load-all,  while expensive  has halved  the time feeding  silage  as well as 
assisting  in most  tasks  around  the farm. A farm quad is used  to herd the cows  and dust 
the pastures.  It saves  a lot of time not to mention  making  the handling  of bulls a safer 
job.
142
oows are moved  on a 24-hour  or longer  interval  depending  on the paddock  Temporary  
mres are used sparingly,  which reduces  work but not performance.  Calf rearing  
systems  around  the country  changed  this spring  with the FMD restrictions  and our farm  
«as no exception.  A calf feeder,  which is pulled behind  the quad, was purchased.  
Aes were fed in batches  of 20-25.The  feeder  holds  enough  milk to feed 4 batches  at 
3time. Some  of the calves  were fed once a day some  twice each day. Obviously  the 
alves fed on once a day required  less labour  but their growth  was affected  compared  
«th the calves  that were fed twice a day. This has implications  only for calves  that are 
IT sale. Once a day feeding  works  very well for calves  that are being retained  on the
Record keeping
Jsing a cornputer  programme  to fulfil register  requirements  has proved  to be timesavinq  
rd more efficient  in the longer  term. The large amount  of data that needs  to be stored  
rd processed  makes keeping  the blue book in written form a very cumbersome  
tercise. I am looking  forward  to registering  the calvings  by e-mail next spring,  
fookwork  is taking more and more time. Our incomes  are becoming  dependant  on 
tod records.  Agricultural  byelaws,  codes  of Good Practice  and many  other  forms  of 
wonmental  constraints  require  our time to keep records.  Losing  the right to farm is 
•e price for failing  to find that time.
issons  from the Labour  survey  for our farm
jpecific areas  that need attention  become  obvious  for each farmer  when they look at 
^data  for their own farm. In the case of our farm, crossing  cows  on the road from the 
#ing parlour  to different  blocks  of ground  uses up at lot of time. Washing  the milking  
lachine  and cleaning  yards  is other  routine  work  that takes  time each  day Daily  chores  
lould be minimised  or removed  from the routine  if at all possible.  In the milking  parlour  
re are 12 rows of cows for each milking,  which is too many. The Solution  to this is 
r extra milking  units, which  would  reduce  the throughput  to nine rows. The addition  
duster removers  on the then 20-unit  parlour  would  facilitate  a one-man  operation  
king machine  washing  is another  chore that automatic  washing  would eliminate,  
torising  the backing  gate as well as fixing  a yard scraper  to the gate would  help one 
n milking  and complete  another  chore  at the same  time. The construction  of a tunnel  
i ier the road would  be a real labour  saving  possibility  and would  be the best labour  
mg move of all. The saving on the chore of herding  (again helps a one-man  
ration) would be welcome,  but also the reduced  soiled  water  and slurry from the 
ecting yard. It would  be reduced  by as  much  as 75%. Our experience  has been  that 
person  versus  two makes  little difference  time wise to the milking  but it makes  a big 
fence to have two people  when herding  and washing  is taken  into account.
4es affecting  Labour  Efficiency  in the long Term
ilready  discussed  the farming  system  would  have the biggest  impact  on the labour  
iency in the longer  term as well as the shorter  term. In this context,  nothing  would  
I Hied out as a possibility  as far as we’re concerned.  This goes  from on the one hand  
sidering  robotic  milking  and how it might  suit your situation,  to at the other extreme
143
considering  once a day milking. The latter in particular  could provide  possibilities for 
labour  saving  as well as expansion  in a non quota  situation  i.e. in our situation  some  of 
the blocks  of land would be available  for grazing  if the cows only needed  to travel to 
them once a day. The farming  system  chosen  by the Farmer  impacts  on his lifestyle,  
his social  possibilities  and family  commitments.  For farmers  to take the attitude  of older 
generations  where  labour  on the farm took precedent  over all other  commitments  is not 
sustainable  or desirable  in the modern  world. Neither  can we ignore  the impact  that our 
farming  system  has on the attitudes  of the younger  generation  towards  farming. If 
younger  people  have choices  as to what career  path they are going to take, we can 
hardly  expect  them to go farming  if we don’t make it attractive  for them. A shortage  of 
young  people  taking  up farming  as a c^areer  will make  the labour  situation  impossible  
and will lead to the overburdening  and isolation  of those  of us that will be left farming.  
The energy  and enthusiasm  of youth  makes  all the difference  to any farm.
The returns  from  Agriculture  will affect  labour  in the longer  term. The ability  to compete  
with other  employment  or finance  machines  to do the work depends  on farm profit. We 
will hardly  encourage  our children  to farm if incomes  are very low.
Milk quotas  have an impact  on Labour  efficiency  at the moment  and are likely to have 
for the future. Milk quotas  discourage  people  who are actually  milking  the cows  and are 
an enormous  deterrent  for young  people  entering  the industry.  Milk quotas  effect  our 
management  decisions.  They lead to inefficiencies,  which put stresses  on labour 
resources  leading  to strategies  that are not labour  friendly.  In fact these  strategies  don’t 
consider  the labour  implications  at all. For example,  changing  feeding  regimes  in the 
springtime  to limit production,  overfeeding  calves  with whole  milk forced  to lease  extra 
land with quota leading  to extra stock to work the land. This gives a lot of labour  with 
no profit. From our farm ’s point of view and probably  from most other  active  producers,  
the sooner  the milk quotas  regime  is dismantled  the better,  from a labour-efficiency  point 
of view not to mention  all the other  obvious  reasons.
Labour  Efficiency  is a challenge  facing every farmer. Fulltime  or partime  how we 
organise  our day is vital to our success.  A challenge  is there  to be met and overcome.  
You are not successful  farmers  by accident  you’ve put the work in. Farmers  ask, "What 
will I do with all this time that’s saved? ” Perhaps  you could spend  it thinking  of ways  to 
save more  time on the farm.

Planning  for a Future  in Irish Dairy Farming
THIA  HENNESSY
Rural Economy  Research  Centre,  Teagasc
Introduction
Ills commonly  remarked  that Ireland  has dramatically  transformed  itself  in recent  years.
. Rural and urban  areas  scarcely  resemble  their former  selves  and likewise  industry  and 
1 agriculture  have undergone  major  change  over the last decade.  These  changes  to the 
economy  in general  and more specifically  agriculture  are a result of a number  of 
combined  forces. It is likely that many of these forces  will continue  to play a part in 
I shaping  the future  direction  of Irish agriculture  and therefore  must be taken  into account  
by anyone  who is planning  for a future  in dairy farming.
This paper  will begin by outlining  the issues that will influence  the future  development  of 
Irish dairy farming  and their potential  impact. The issues  addressed  relate  to the effect  
of the economic  boom,  demographic  trends  and agricultural  policies.  Given  the issues  
that are likely  to shape  the future  of Irish dairy  farming  there  will be a discussion  on how 
farmers  can respond  to these  challenges.
Issues  Affecting  the Future  of Irish Dairy Farming
The Celtic Tiger
Few economies  have changed  as radically  and rapidly as Ireland. We have  
experienced  exceptional  growth. GDP grew by almost  70% from 1990 to 1998. This 
economic  boom has had repercussions  for agriculture.  Nationally  the importance  of 
agriculture  has diminished.  In 1990 agriculture  accounted  for 10% of GDP and 15% of 
total employment  compared  to 5% of GDP and 9% of employment  by 1999. Strong  
growth is projected  to continue  in the future  and this will have an enormous  impact  on 
agriculture.  The Celtic  Tiger economy  will influence  the future direction  of Irish dairy  
farming  through  three main channels.
Higher  incomes
Industrial  wages  have increased  by over 40% in the last ten years. This increase  has 
resulted  in a large divergence  between  industrial  and agricultural  incomes.  As long as 
the current  economic  boom continues  this divergence  is likely to grow and will have  
repercussions  for farming.  Retaining  farm numbers  will be a challenge,  as will attracting  
new young farmers  into the sector. The cost of hiring labour  or farm relief has also 
increased.
Inflation
Inflation  averaged  at 5.6% for the year 2000 according  to the Central  Statistics  Office.  
Due to inflation  farmers  can expect  a substantial  increase  in production  costs. Costs  
such as labour,  energy  and services  are all projected  to increase  substantially  over the
145
next number  of years. The FAPRI-lreland  Partnership''  has projected  that such costs 
will increase  by over 25% in the next ten years. Secondly,  the purchasing  power  of 
incomes  earned  will be significantly  diminished  due to inflation. With the price of 
consumer  products  rising,  the amount  of goods  that can be purchased  with the average  
agricultural  wage Is declining.
Employment  Opportunities
Unemployment  levels have dropped  from 16% in 1993 to 3.5% in 2001. For the first 
time in the history  of the State  the economy  is operating  at full employment.  Although  
this is an excellent  achievement  for the economy  and the people  of Ireland,  It has 
created  problems  for agriculture.  Young  people  are lured out of farming  by the prospect  
of higher  paid  jobs for less working  hours. Further,  farm labour  is difficult  and expensive  
to secure.
Demographic  Trends
The Celtic  Tiger economy  is often cited for the decrease  in the number  of farmers  in 
general  and for the shortage  of young  farmers  in particular.  Entry  into farming  however,  
is subject  to demographic  influences  that introduce  degree  of inertia into the entry 
process  that may lead to declining  entry  even  when  economic  conditions  are favourable  
(Gale 1996). The demographic  trends  show  that there are less young  people  living on 
farms. There  are fewer  farmers  than there  were a generation  ago; these  farmers  are 
having  fewer children,  as shown by Table 1. The number  of children  on farms is 
projected  to decline  further. Hence,  the potential  base for new young farmers  is 
naturally  shrinking  and this is impacting  on the number  of those  entering  farming.
Table  1. Number  of farmers ’ children  aged 16 to 20*
Years Number  of Children Change
1981 44,412 100
1986 40,300 91
1991 35,359 80
1996 28,209 64
2011 12,075 27
* Source:  Kennedy  and Williams  Report  1999
The Kennedy  Wiliams  report projects  that by 2011 there will be little over 12,000  
children  of school  leaving  age living  on farms,  i.e. between  16 and 20 years  of age. That 
is 58% less than the 1996 estimate. If the potential  number  of future farmers  is 
decreasing  at such a rate, then the actual  numbers  will inevitably  decline,  unless  there  
is more scope  for young  people  from non-farming  families  to enter  agriculture.

The Policy  Climate
There has been considerable  change  in the agricultural  policy of the EU under  the 
Agenda  2000  Agreement  and it seems  that EU farmers  can expect  even more changes  
in the future. Simultaneously  there  has also been policy  change  on the domestic  scene.  
The most recent  policy  agreements  that will directly  influence  Irish dairy  farmers  are the 
Agenda  2000 policy  package  and the new rules on milk quota  transfer.  Although  these  
agreements  secure  agricultural  policy  over  the next number  of years  there is continued  
pressure  for reform  of the CAP. For example  Irish farmers  may be faced  with milk quota  
elimination  in the not too distant  future.
At the time of the Agenda  2000  negotiations,  the “London  Club ” (UK, Italy, Denmark  and 
Sweden)  was in support  of quota elimination.  The agreement  therewith  was that milk 
quotas  would prevail  until 2008 under  the Agenda  2000 Agreement  with a review  in 
2003. Since then, some official  support  for quota elimination  has been expressed  in 
both Germany  and Spain. Additionally,  EU enlargement  and the WTO negotiations  may 
be a further  catalyst  to the dismantling  of the quota regime. It seems  that there is a 
possibility that EU dairy  farmers  will be faced  with the prospect  of milk quota  elimination  
in this decade. It is probable  that this will not occur until 2008 at the earliest.  A later 
section  of this paper  deals  with the possible  effects  of milk quota elimination  on Irish 
dairy farmers.
Further  reform  of the CAP may be instigated  by EU enlargement.  Following  the EU 
summit  in Nice in December  2000,  it looks  likely  that the first wave  of countries  is to join 
by the summer  of 2004. The first wave consists  of Poland,  Hungary,  the Czech  
Republic,  Slovenia,  Estonia  and Cyprus. The process  of enlargement  will create  
difficulties  for the Commission  in relation  to the CAP. The CEEC (Central  and East 
European  Countries)  are highly  agricultural  and have large production  potential.  It is 
almost  inevitable  that on entry to the Union  farmers  in these  countries  will demand  the 
same direct  payments  and support  prices  paid for agricultural  produce  in the EU. This 
will put serious  budgetary  pressure  on the EU and the funding  of the CAP. Some  
believe  that EU enlargement  may provide  the impetus  required  for further  and more  
significant  reform  of the CAP.
The impending  WTO negotiations  will generate  further  pressure  for agricultural  policy  
reform. The next agreement  is likely to secure  commitment  from the EU to reduce  the 
volume  of subsidised  exports.  This will impact  negatively  on the price paid to farmers  
for produce.  In addition,  the EU will be obliged  to provide  increased  access  to its dairy  
market  to other  exporting  countries  like the US and the Cairns  group.
Clearly,  we can expect  policy  change  in the future  and undoubtedly  it will influence  the 
direction  and development  of the Irish dairy farming  sector. Since  the likely changes  
stemming  from the sources  discussed  above  are not yet known,  the remainder  of this 
paper  deals  with the impact  of Agenda  2000  and domestic  policy  on milk quota  transfer.  
There  is also an examination  of a milk quota  elimination  scenario.
The Agenda  2000  Agreement
The principle  of the Agreement  is to distance  agricultural  policy  even further  from price  
support  and to increase  direct  income  support  while  maintaining  production  quotas.  The
147
intended  objective  of this policy is to make the CAP less trade distorting  and less 
production  inducing  in the eyes of the WTO. Further,  it is intended  that these  changes  
will make the CAP less difficult  and costly to extend  to CEEC in the event of EU 
enlargement.  The details  and workings  of Agenda  2000 were widely  documented  and 
published  at the time of Agreement.  For this reason,  they shall not be reiterated  here.
Domestic  Quota  Transfer  Policy
Policies  with regard  to the transfer  of milk quota in Ireland  have recently  undergone  
change.  Previously  milk quota  could not be freely  traded  and the most common  means  
of permanently  acquiring  quota was to purchase  land and quota as a going-concern.  
Private  leasing  was a common  avenue  for temporary  expansion.  Lease price was 
determined  privately  between  lessee and lessor. Such arrangements  became  so 
common  that in 1999 every three active milk producers  supported  one “dormant  
producer ”.
The new arrangements  agreed  by the Irish Department  of Agriculture,  Food and Rural 
Development  (DAFRD)  require  all “dormant  producers ” leasing  out quota  for longer  than 
3 years  to recommence  production  or to sell quota  into the restructuring  scheme.  Active  
milk producers  may then try to acquire  quota  from the restructuring  scheme  at a fixed 
price, 136p per gallon  in 2000 and 124p in 2001. Allocation  of quota  from restructuring  
will be operated  on a priority  basis,  where  priority  will be determined  by quota  size.
The impact  of Agenda  2000 and the new quota  transfer  rules on typical  dairy farms  will 
be presented  in the ensuing  section  of this paper.
Facing  the challenges
The Outlook  for Dairy  Markets  and Prices
The FAPRI-lreland  project produces  annual projections  of agricultural  commodity  
prices. Projections,  covering  a ten-year  period, are based on the best possible  
information  available  at the time and incorporate  agreed  policies  only. The following  text 
summarises  the results  and projections  for the dairy sector.
Donnellan  (2001) reported  that after a period of weakness  in 1998 and 1999, dairy 
markets  strengthened  in 2000. Export  prices  for both skimmed  and whole  milk powder  
increased  in dollar  terms  while  butter  and cheese  prices  remained  relatively  unchanged.  
Flowever due to the continued  weakening  of the euro against  the dollar  over the course  
of most of the year, prices  for all commodities  were up when measured  in euro. 
Following  the recovery  in international  dairy market  demand  in 2000 conditions  are 
projected  to remain favourable  in the medium  term. Demand  in East Asia has 
strengthened  considerably  and Russia  is projected  to increase  its imports  of butter  and 
cheese by 100% on existing levels over the course of the projection  period.  
Consequently  prices  are set to improve  over the projection  period  when measured  in 
dollar terms. Flowever,  with the dollar projected  to weaken  against  many major 
currencies  over the period,  the outcome  may not be as favourable  when expressed  in 
euro terms.
Projections  for the Irish producer  milk price show prices  declining  slightly  from current
148
levels out to about 2004. After 2004 a more appreciable  decline  takes place as the 
impact  of increased  quota  and lower  intervention  prices  across  the EU, as agreed  under  
Agenda  2000,  feeds  through  to farm level milk prices.

A direct compensation  package  also forms  part of Agenda  2000. The Figure  2 (below)  
shows  the anticipated  revenue  accruing  to the milk sector  over the projection  period  on 
a calendar  year basis.
Figure  2. Projected  Irish Milk Sector  Revenue^  for selected  years
Source:  CSO and FAPRI-lreland  Partnership  Model  (2001)
There is a progressive  decrease  in milk sector  output  value  out to 2010. By 2010 the 
intervention  price reductions  and the general EU quota increases  will be fully 
implemented,  as will the direct  payments  package.  While  the value  of milk produced  by 
the sector will  decline  to 2% below  the current  level, this decline  is counteracted  by the 
introduction  of direct  payments  as agreed  under  Agenda  2000. By 2010  sector  revenue,  
which is shown  in nominal  terms,  is up 6% relative  to 2000 levels.

149
The Impact  on Irish Dairy  Farms
As shown  above,  the value of dairy output is maintained  in nominal  terms, in other 
words the price reductions  occurring  under Agenda  2000 are fully compensated.  
FAPRI-lreland  analyses  show  similar  results  for the beef sector. However,  high rates of 
inflation  mean  that farmers  will be subjected  to a price  cost squeeze.  Strong  growth  and 
inflation  rates, higher  than those experienced  in recent  years will result in continued  
increases  in production  costs. Fixed  costs  are projected  to increase  by 15 to 20% thus 
impacting  negatively  on farm net margin. Farmers  who do not respond  by increasing  
efficiency  or enlarging  operations  will be exposed  to a price-cost  squeeze. The 
message  for farmers  is, as it has been for many  years,  it is necessary  to run faster  in 
order  to stand still.
Larger  and more progressive  farmers  will be able to maintain  or modestly  increase  
incomes  in real terms  through  expansion  of milk quota  and purchase  of currently  leased  
quota. However,  smaller  farms  with a quota of 20,000  gallons  or less, which  have a 
poor historical  growth  record  and cost structure  will be unable  to expand  milk quota  at 
the current  fixed restructuring  price of 124p per gallon. It is projected  that in a number  
of years such farms  will sell quota into the restructuring  pool and cease  farming.  The 
exit of these  farmers  is the result  of a combination  of push and pull factors.  Diminishing  
margins,  unaffordable  expansion  and rising  living  and production  costs  push  farmers  out 
of the industry.  Simultaneously,  the attractive  sale price of quota  and the lure of higher  
off farm incomes  pull farmers  out of the sector. The projected  high growth  rate for the 
rest of the economy  should  ensure  a supply  of off-farm  employment  opportunities.  It 
can be concluded  that some 11,000  farmers,  may find that the future  of their farm is not 
viable and some may exit dairy farming. The exit of these farmers  will increase  the 
availability  of quota through  the restructuring  scheme  and therefore  enhance  the 
opportunities  for prosperity  for the remaining  farms.
Teagasc  research  has examined  typical Irish dairy farms and estimated  the level of 
expansion  possible  and probable  between  now and 2007 Hennessy  (2001). The 
resulting  effect  on income  over the period  was calculated.  Results  showed  that for a 
typical  dairy  farm of 40,000  gallons  an increase  in quota  of 30% would  result  in an 11% 
increase  in incomes  in real terms,  that is allowing  for inflation.  Any further  expansion  in 
quota  was unlikely  to boost  incomes  in the short  term given  the cost of purchasing  plus 
the cost of the additional  required  resources.  Furthermore,  the likelihood  that farms 
would be able to secure  additional  quota  above  this level is minimal.  For larger  dairy 
farmers  acquisition  of milk quota may be more difficult,  as they do not qualify  as a 
priority  group  under  the new quota  regulations.  Large  farmers  are expected  to maintain  
their current  income  levels in real terms by purchasing  quota which they previously  
leased,  effective  cost management  and through  the strategic  management  of the dry 
stock  herd in order  to maximise  the receipt  of direct  payments.
The Effect  of Milk Quota  Elimination  on Irish Dairy  Farms
An analysis  of the impact  of milk quota  elimination  on typical  farms  is presented  below.
It is assumed  that quotas  are eliminated  in 2008 and there is no phasing  out process^
3 In reality immediate  elimination  of quota is unlikely.  It is more likely that a gradual  increase  in 
quota  over a long time period  will occur.
150
An estimate  of the level of production  required  to maintain  living standards,  i.e. to be no 
worse  off, following  quota elimination  is presented.  The feasibility  of achieving  this is 
also examined,
A drop in milk prices  will inevitably  accompany  milk quota  elimination.  Research  shows  
that due to Ireland s product  mix, prices  may not fall as low as world market  rates but 
will be approximately  30% below current prices, FAPRI (1998). Some form of 
compensation  is likely to be paid in a post quota situation  and it would probably  be 
linked to historical  production.  The impending  WTO agreement  is likely to prohibit  
compensation  of new production  above  that produced  during  the GATT era. Here three  
possible  price and compensation  scenarios  have been assumed.
70p per gallon  plus lOp compensation  on 1998/99  production.
70p per gallon  plus 20p compensation  on 1998/99  production.
80p per gallon  plus 15p compensation  on 1998/99  production.
Milk quota  elimination  will also affect  input  prices.  The projected  increase  in input  prices  
under  Agenda  2000 has already  been discussed,  i.e. inflation  and the effect  of the Celtic  
Tiger, However,  many believe  that some input prices would fall following  quota  
elimination.  Prices  of agricultural  based  inputs  such as foodstuffs  and machinery  are 
linked to agricultural  output prices. Where  output prices fall these input prices will 
inevitably  fall, such was the case following  deregulation  in New Zealand.  Conversely,  
non-agricultural  inputs  such as energy  and labour  will not decrease  in price, as they are 
not dependent  on the buoyancy  or otherwise  of the dairy sector. It is difficult  to project  
the magnitude  of price reductions  in a non-quota  scenario.  It is assumed  here that the 
reduction  that is likely to occur  following  quota  abolition  will negate  approximately  50% 
of the prior increase  and post-quota  production  costs would be between  6% and 7% 
higher  than 1999 costs,  albeit  less the cost of leasing  milk quota.
Given  the expected  milk price reduction  it is evident  that expansion  will be necessary  in 
order to maintain  current  income  levels in a post quota scenario. Recent  Teagasc  
research  (Hennessy  2000),  calculated  the level of expansion  required  on average  farms  
to maintain  income  levels. This is presented  in Figure  3.
Figure  3. Level  of expansion  required  to maintain  income  levels

Average  farm Sizes  in Gallons100,000
i70p&10p □ 70p &20p □ 80p & 15p
151
As shown,  farms currently  supplying  17,000  gallons  would need to increase  current  
production  by 140% in order  to maintain  incomes  if the milk price fell to 70p per gallon  
and lOp compensation  was paid. Production  would  have  to increase  by between  120%  
and 85% in the subsequent  two scenarios  if incomes  are to be maintained.  Farms  
supplying  35,000  gallons  will need to expand  significantly.  In the first price scenario  
88,000  gallons  of milk is required  to maintain  incomes,  an increase  of 125%. Production  
needs  to increase  by 110% and 75%, which is 80,000  and 66,000  gallons,  in order  to 
maintain  current  incomes  in the other  two scenarios.  The situation  is the same  for larger  
farms. Those with a quota of 60,000 gallons  need to expand  by 110% to 70% 
depending  on the price scenarios.  Similarly,  those  currently  supplying  100,000  gallons  
need to increase  production  by between  90% and 50% depending  on prices and 
compensation.  Clearly  substantial  expansion  of production  is required  by all farm sizes 
if incomes  are to be maintained.
It is often argued  that there is large production  potential  on farms  lying dormant  due to 
the quota  constraint  and thus production  could be increased  without  investment.  Yields  
are depressed  due to shortened  lactation  periods and avoidance  of super-levy  
payments.  Additionally,  specialisation  in dairy production  on farms is low due to poor 
distribution  of milk quota  across  many  farms  as shown  by Table  2.
Table  2. Average  level of specialisation  in dairy livestock  1999

Dairy Cows  % of iivestock  units 48 58 59 62
Source:  National  Farm Survey  1999
Specialisation  is quite low particularly  on farms  with smaller  quota. Hence,  most farms  
have a large number  of livestock  other than dairy cows. Teagasc  research  has 
estimated  the number  of cows that could be kept on farms  if they were substituted  for 
other livestock. This figure was calculated  through  consideration  of land, labour,  
housing  and milking  parlour  capacity.
In addition  to increasing  dairy cow numbers  it is also likely that productivity  per cow 
would be improved  if milk quotas  were removed.  Data shows  that typically  yields  per 
cow improve  at a rate of 1.3% per annum  in Ireland. Thus by 2008, present  deliveries  
per cow will have progressed  significantly.  Moreover,  Teagasc  have estimated  that 
deliveries  could be increased  by 9% by lengthening  lactation  and by 3-5% by sale of 
milk currently  fed to calves. Cow numbers  can be increased  through  specialisation  and 
it seems  that productivity  per cow can also increase.  By combining  these  factors  the 
average  production  potential  of Irish dairy farms in a post-quota  situation  can be 
determined.  This potential  is presented  Table  3.
152

% Change  98/99  to post-quota 65 43 37 38
Atypical  farm that supplied  17,000  gallons  in the 1998/99  milk year has the potential  to 
increase  deliveries  by 65% to an average  of 28,000  gallons  without  any additional  
investment.  The other  three  size groups  can increase  deliveries  by 43%, 37% and 38% 
respectively.
As was shown substantial  expansion  of production  is required  if farmers  wish to 
maintain  real incomes. Achieving  this expansion  is not possible  within current  
resources.  For example  the typical  farm supplying  17,000  gallons  in 1998/99  has the 
potential  to increase  milk production  by 65% on existing  resources.  However,  increases  
in production  to the order  of 85% to 140%  are required  if real income  is to be maintained  
in a post quota scenario.  Clearly  capital  investment  is necessary  in order to expand  
production  to the levels required.  The situation  is similar  for the other  farms  although  
on larger  farms  the existing  potential  brings  production  closer  to the required  level.
The amount  of capital  investment  necessary  to maintain  real income  was estimated.  
Results  showed  that investment  costs  varied  depending  on the price scenario  and the 
farm size. In some  instances  the capital  requirements  were  excessively  large  especially  
given  the level of income  produced.  For this reason,  the research  focussed  on the cash  
surplus  remaining  following  annual repayments.  It is found that up to one-third  of 
producers  currently  supplying  less than 35,000  gallons  would  find investment  infeasible,  
given the level of cash surplus  remaining.  Furthermore  it was shown that where  
investment  was feasible  between  20% and 30% of the current  population,  depending  on 
the price scenario,  would  have a disposable  income  lower  than the minimum  wage.
Although  all farm sizes are capable  of significant  expansion  in production  both before  
and following  investment,  this expansion  is not sufficient.  Investment  in order  to expand  
further is impossible  for some farms. Clearly milk quota elimination,  under the 
assumptions  that have been made here, would have a negative  impact  on supplier  
numbers.
Conclusions
We see that in both situations  small farmers  are vulnerable  to the policy  changes  and 
the impact  of the strong  macro  economy.  In the Agenda  2000 case, farmers  supplying  
20,000  gallons  or less become  non-viable  by 2003/2004.  It is expected  that some of 
these farmers  will sell theirs  quotas  into the restructuring  pool and reallocate  their land 
to either letting or cattle farming.  At least under  Agenda  2000 these smaller  farmers  
have a valuable  asset  to sell namely  quota  and their land commands  a reasonable  price  
on the letting  market  while  there  is still strong  demand  from other  dairy  farmers.  If these  
small farmers  are still in existence  when quotas  are abolished  they will need to make  
considerable  investment  in order  to earn even the minimum  wage. This research  has
153
shown  that for a large proportion  of farms that this would not be possible  due to the 
onerous  repayment  requirements.  It may be necessary  for these farmers  to exit 
dairying.  Exit from farming  at this stage  would  not be as profitable  as the asset  value 
of milk quota  has been eroded  and land rental  and sale values  may also have fallen.
If there is a large exodus  from farming  prior to milk quota  elimination  then quota  will be 
available  on the restructuring  market. If those  farmers  who remain  in dairy  farming  can 
increase  their production  by acquiring  quota  then their  future  following  quota  elimination  
may be brighter  as they will be in a better  starting  position  and therefore  will not need 
the same  magnitude  of expansion.  Additionally,  if the land market  is adversely  affected  
by the elimination  of quota,  this is also beneficial  for the remaining  farms,  as the cost of 
expansion  will be reduced.
Final Points  to Consider
The Celtic Tiger boom has diminished  the overall importance  of agriculture  to the 
general  economy.  This is a trend that is likely to continue  especially  as the number  of 
farmers  will probably  continue  to decrease.
Inflation  is rampant  in the Tiger economy  and will impact  negatively  on dairy farming.  
Costs of production  will increase  while output prices are relatively  frozen under  the 
Agenda  2000 agreement.  Farms  will be exposed  to a price cost squeeze  and the 
purchasing  power  of incomes  will fall due to inflation. Effective  cost management  is 
crucial.
Expansion  of milk quota is necessary  to maintain  purchasing  power. Smaller  dairy 
farms  will find expansion  unaffordable  at the fixed quota-restructuring  price of 124p per 
gallon. They will be pushed  out of farming  by poor profits and pulled out by the 
attractiveness  of quota  sale and employment  in other  sectors.  The exit of smaller  farms 
will allow remaining  ones to grow  and thus to maintain  incomes  in real terms.
Quota  abolition  will affect  all farm sizes. All would  need  to increase  output  considerably  
in order  to maintain  living standards.  Although,  large potential  currently  exists  on farms 
to increase  output (even before investment),  this is insufficient.  Capital  investment  
requirements  for most farms are large, repayment  obligations  are burdensome  and 
incomes  derived  are still meagre.  In general  it is likely that milk quota  abolition  will not 
pose a favourable  opportunity  for most of the population.  However,  the exceptions  to 
this are those currently  leasing  the majority  of their quota or those who have a large 
amount  of under  utilised  milking  parlour  and housing  capacity.
Finally  we can expect  that EU enlargement  and the WTO negotiations  will instigate  
further  changes  to the current  policy  framework.

The Irish Milk Processing  Sector
JOHN  O’REILLY

Introduction
Milk is a super product,  and encouraging  people  to invest in dairy companies  is not 
difficult. Advances  in technology  and knowledge  create opportunities  for profitable  
investment  in milk. Also increasing  health  and nutrition  awareness  on the part of the 
consumer  and proactive  interest  in, and management  of, their own well-being,  means  
that the milk processing  sector  will remain  attractive  for investment.  However,  it is 
important  that stakeholders  (suppliers  and shareholders),  as potential  change  agents  in 
the dairy sector  understand  that there is no quick  fix solution  for the culture  shift that is 
required. It is important  that farmers  understand  that they are part of the change  
process,  not independent  of it, and that Irish milk processing  is what it is, not in spite of 
farmers,  but perhaps  because  of farmers.
If you want  your industry  to change,  then you must be open  to change.  If you don’t want 
to change,  then you are the problem  - farmers  either  directly  or indirectly,  own the dairy 
industry,  and it cannot  change  radically  without  your agreement  or support.
As an observer  and a commentator  on the food industry,  I know that it is the 
entrepreneur  or the executive  (with an entrepreneurial  flair), which  brings  about  change  
in a sector. Entrepreneurs  are creative.  They invent  new things,  new ways of doing  
things. New things,  ideas,  products,  processes,  challenge  old things,  usurp  them. The 
creative  process  is thus destructive.  It may not be possible  to have the former  without  
the latter, but equally,  if the latter  is shunned  (i.e. the status  quo is protected),  the former  
may not be possible!
The creative  processes,  take advantage  of the fact that most people  (for genetic  and 
cultural  reasons)  try to avoid risk. An edge is gained  by creating  uncertainty  for others.  
Innovators  foresee  that things  can be very different  to the way they now are, to how 
most people  see them,  or how they wish to see them. There  are no facts to support  an 
innovative  product  or process.  There  is no ready  market  for innovation.  Innovation,  or 
more accurately  radical  innovation,  creates  a market  where  none existed.  To go for it 
the entrepreneur  must rely mostly  on gut feel, instinct  or intuition  and not analysis.  The 
process  is also unpredictable.  Often  times,  the final outcome,  modified  by the process  
itself, can only be known  in its completion,  not in its anticipation.
If we want a different  dairy industry,  then we may need creators  and not minders.  In 
fact, the history  of industrial  change,  says this is an imperative,  but the cultural  context  
has to enable  this to happen. History  also says that industry  outsiders  are the key 
change  agents  as an industry ’s prevailing  culture  may lock it onto a particular  pathway,  
a dogmatic  one that closes  off other possible  ways of doing things. Bringing  about  
change  in a firm or in a sector  from within  is very difficult;  the record  of success  is poor. 
The starting  point  has to be culture,  but how to change  this? The future  of the Irish dairy 
industry  is dependent  on its culture.  Culture  is the contextual  system  of meaning,  values  
and beliefs,  which govern  how things  are seen, how things are done, and how it is
156
believed  things  should  be seen and done. Everybody  is bound  up with this. Culture  
influences  all it touches  and is itself influenced  reinforced  or changed,  in the process.  
Industry  change  is more than about  assessing  the market  opportunity  for this or that 
product  or technology.  You only get to this stage if you are open to the idea of doing  
something  different  with all that this involves  in risk, uncertainty  etc. You don’t change  
the room by moving  the furniture  about. You won ’t change  the room if you view its 
boundaries  as fixed.
How is milk seen? As farm output?  As a basic  product?  As a complex  source  of health  
and nutrition  for a consumer  audience  now more  focused  and ever  more  demanding  on 
these  issues?
The outcome  is determined  by the structure.  Thus, how we view milk determines  what  
we do with it, but it also determines  what  we don’t do with it. If we see it chiefly  as farm 
output  then we don’t see it as food; most effort will be made to improve  production  
efficiency  and profit  at farm level. Support  will be biased  towards  education  and. If we 
see milk as basic product,  the industry  will be characterised  by commodity  production  
and processes  and everything  done  will reinforce  this condition,  a condition  that will be 
presented  as unavoidable.  If milk is seen as a source  of health  and nutrition,  then this 
will shape attitudes  to spending  on research  and development,  the commitment  we 
make to extending  our scientific  knowledge  and technology,  the type of learning  and 
training  we believe  we need, want and invest in. Also it will reflect  our attitude  to 
investment  spending,  to profit and to the business  enterprise  itself  
Is the culture one, which inclines  farmers  and suppliers  to view investment  in 
processing,  and profit as farm income  foregone?  Is the culture  one, which inclines  
executives  to stick to familiar  pathways  and to avoid  operational  and financial  risk? For 
example,  there  is little operational  risk in commodity  production  or selling. Financial  risk 
is also small. Is the culture  one, which  causes  Governments  and regulatory  agencies  
to place  the interests  of production  above  those  of consumption?
A culture  needs  to be open to new ideas  before  it can assimilate  these. This is true for 
the individual  or any collection  of individuals  - family, team, club, firm or society. A 
culture  set in its ways  - opposed  to new ideas,  not only does it not easily  accept  change  
but fights resolutely  against  it. Even where  there is openness  to change,  bringing  this 
about is no easy task. It is a process  that needs  very careful  execution  because,  if 
botched,  the openness  that was there will be substituted  by strong  fundamentalism.  
Where  there  is antagonism  to change  the tendency  is for people  to redouble  their efforts  
in support  of existing  ways. Firms do this also. When  faced with an innovation,  the 
tendency  is to beat back innovation  by perfecting  the old!
People  tend to behave  in one of three  ways. Do as they always  do; do as others  do; or 
strike out on their own. Most fall into the first two categories,  but this can create  
tensions.  The more  feedback  that is positive,  the more  the action  will be supported  and 
the more people  that will lend their support. In this instance  people  migrate  from the 
status  quo. Over  time, the new state becomes  the status  quo and becomes  as heavily  
defended  as its antecedent  state. Change  is a dynamic  process;  it must be a 
continuous  process.  It is also dialectical  in the sense  that what  may be strong  today  can 
transform  to weakness  under  different  circumstance.  An organisation  open to change
157
is potentially  forever  changing.  Change  should  not be a process  with a prescribed  or 
necessary  ending. Hence  the outcome  of change  can be unpredictable.
From  this, the following  can be observed  about  businesses.  The more successful  they 
are the more  change  resistant  they become.  This is understandable  if one thinks  about  
it. A successful  company  does things  in a certain  way to be, or to remain,  successful.  
This becomes  hereditary  and routine  for its staff. Routines  establish  order;  they define  
the limits of what one may do (and what one may not do). They are a control  
mechanism,  which  channel  people  along a chosen  pathway.  A firm’s reward  system  is 
linked to how well or otherwise  its staff adheres  to the organisation ’s rules or, more 
widely,  its culture.  As long as this (and its products)  are adapted  to the environment,  it 
will be successful.  However,  the big risk is that in an environmental  change  it becomes  
difficult  for staff to adapt, all the more so if routines  don’t permit  this. So, in a very 
contradictory  way, success  is a major  contributor  to a firm’s failure  to adapt. In fact, 
bringing  about  strategic  re-direction  from within  a firm is very difficult,  as is revealed  in 
the observation  that probably  less than 20% of enterprises  have  successful  cultural,  and 
therefore  corporate,  makeovers.
Like organisms  and species,  firms can be appropriate  to a particular  environment  or 
circumstance  but subsequently  inappropriate.  McDonalds  is a case in point. It is finding  
it very hard to sustain  a business  model  that was appropriate  for the 'baby  boom ’ period  
(nearly  4 decades  ago) but appears  to be less so to day. Incremental  changes  to the 
model are failing to sustain  its historical  growth  rate. More radical  change  may be 
required.
Think of an outstanding  innovation  in milk e g. Mueller  Dairy Desserts.  Mueller  made  
yoghurt  by a new means. Similarly,  Cuisine  de France  makes  bread  in a very different  
way and in a different  value network  to plant - baked bread. Both companies  were 
outsiders.  Their  innovations  developed  new categories  and took share  from established 
players.  Both lead their categories.
Two further  examples  help to elaborate  the point. These  are Baileys  and Ryanair Both 
invented  new markets,  which  they dominate  respectively.  Ryanair  did not compete  with 
Aer Lingus  for the latter ’s customers.  It discovered  an audience,  which  had never  flown  
previously  or would  do so less frequently  if Ryanair  did not exist. Baileys  invented  Irish 
cream  liqueur. Its success  attracted  many imitators,  but all compete  in the restricted  
market  space  not dominated  by Baileys.
The essential  points  of these  anecdotes  are as follow:
• Radical  innovation  typically  comes from outside  an industry,  while established  
players  typically  focus  on improvements  to existing  products  or processes.
• Inventing  and developing  a new category  or market  and then dominating  these  
represent  really  successful  strategy.
It can therefore  be claimed  that good strategy  is about:
• Refusing  to accept  the established  order  of things
• Foreseeing  the future  shape  of things
• Creating  uncertainty  in products  or markets  for established  players
• Good  timing  and building  momentum  behind  first mover  advantage
158
j It was said at the outset that change  and innovation  are individually  led and not 
I collectively  arrived at. Innovation  is creative  and highly intuitive  in nature. The 
probability  of its success  cannot  be proven  in advance.  In fact, a heavy reliance  on 
analysis  will almost  certainly  fail to arrive at an innovative  solution.  This is because  
forecasts  tend to work off the present and the known and cannot deal with 
discontinuities.  An innovation  is a discontinuity  for an established  product  or market.
I strongly  believe  that good strategic  thinking  is a highly  personal  activity  and is not the 
selection  of an external  off-the-shelf  solution.  Outsiders  can help by way of critique,  but 
rot otherwise.  Successful  strategies  are imitated  (remember  what was said about  
people  doing  what  others  do). In this way an entire  industry  can change  the way it sees  
and does things  by following  a leader. We therefore,  need leaders  In whom  we trust to 
enable us to take the risk that change  involves. Inspirational  leaders  do not travel  
familiar  pathways.
If it is not axiomatic  that an industry  outsider  must lead change,  the evidence  
nonetheless  strongly  supports  this proposition.  Thus, whilst  it can be argued  that the 
[Irish milk processing  industry  needs  a radical  shift in attitudes,  there  is a high probability  
flat this will have to come from an industry  outsider.  As the arrival of a corporate  
outsider  seems  unlikely,  the shift will have to be driven  by changing  attitudes  within  the 
industry  (unlikely  for the reasons  mentioned),  or via the recruitment  of individuals  from 
outside  the traditional  channels  of education,  training  and recruitment.  However  the 
ndustry  will have to be more attractive  than at present,  absolutely  and relative  to other  
sectors,  in terms  of reward,  challenge,  opportunity  and fulfillment.
Recruitment  of a different  managerial  mindset  cannot happen  in isolation.  A new 
(nanagement  outlook  will not succeed  in the context  of an historical,  unchanging  
ownership\supplier  attitude,  especially  if this is risk averse. New ideas in backward  
boking  organisations  perish  for the simple  reason  that a firm’s hierarchy  is likely to be 
controlled  mostly  by those  associated  with its past; these  will most likely  want  to repeat  
ihe past. They  tend to look in the rear view mirror  to go forward!
-tecidents  can happen. Unique  circumstances  can bring like-minded  stakeholders  
management,  shareholders,  suppliers)  together,  i.e. when the interest  of all those  
nvolved  is mutual. This is the exception.  Typically  each firm is a struggle  between  the 
juards  of the status  quo and those  who want  change;  the guards  usually  win out for the 
amply reason  that they occupy  the senior  positions  and put in place structures  that 
wnor and respect  them and their views. In a study  some  years  back it was found  that 
10% of people  in an organisation  are fundamentally  change-resistant  and that a similar  
lumber want continual  or continuous  change. The remaining  80% are not 
tindamentally  opposed  to change  but will only buy into it when it is credible  for them  
md is well led. Heaven  help an organisation  that attempts  change  but makes  a mess  
fit!
iicreasingly  one becomes  sceptical  of the value  of grand  plans for industry  restructuring  
Hsed on some romantic  vision  for the future. I am persuaded  in this by more recent  
ladings  on change  and innovation,  as this has occurred  in many industries,  sectors  
ind categories.  Outsiders  or individuals  who dream a different  way to markets,  
roducts  and new processes  are the key actors in this. The idea that to dream  
minhibitedly  is vital to good strategy  has gained  ground  in recent  times,  and that over­
159
reliance  on financial  analysis  and the use of metrics  based  on historical  circumstance  or 
performance  is of limited  value in this process.
Conventional  analysis  starts from where we are and as noted finds it hard to base 
assumptions  on anything  other  than current  trends. Typically  therefore  forecasts  have 
difficulty  in envisaging  change.  One can put up lots of data and figures  about  the dairy 
industry  (Irish and overseas),  and draw lots of conclusions.  Suppose  the IGA dairy 
conference  actually  took place when it was first scheduled  in April (instead  of 
September).  A most significant  event would not have been foreseen,  i.e. Kerry ’s 
takeover  of Golden  Vale Insofar  as it was not anticipated,  Kerry’ s move  constitutes a 
discontinuity  as far as existing  assumptions  about  the industry  are concerned.  This 
event will cause other developments  to take place. The majority  dismissed  the 
probability  of success,,  but when this was perceived  to be likely, many  of the doubters  
became  zealots.
It is impossible  to predict  the future, but it won’t necessarily  be an extension  of the 
present.  For this reason,  the Irish milk-processing  sector  will evolve  in a way that is not 
predictable.  Some  catalyst,  or a number  of catalysts  will cause  it to follow  a trajectory  
that won ’t be a trendline  extension  of today. The trajectory  may have better  or worse 
outcome  than results  from current  circumstances.  It is, of course,  possible  that it won ’t 
change  at all, but given  the apparent  progress  taking  place  elsewhere  in the world  dairy 
industry,  this would  be highly  regrettable.  Although  not being  able to predict the way or 
course  of change,  it is possible  to say what won ’t happen,  and this is via another  top- 
down industry  report. Suppose  that the only way forward  for the meat industry  is value 
added  produce.  As a premise  the data shows  that little value added  exists. So it can 
be concluded  that unless  value added  is increased  the industry  will struggle  and have 
no economic  future. This kind of circular  thinking  is widespread.  Worse,  it is dangerous.  
Typically  these reports  observe  the current  situation  very negatively.  Many of these 
highly  aspirational  reports  have contributed  to the poor perception  of the food industry,  
including  its constituents  like milk.
The argument  and conclusion  of these  reports  may be brilliant  but the premise  may be 
deeply flawed, to such an extent that un-questioned  policies  may be introduced,  
investment  made,  and actions  taken  which  may dis-improve  industry  structure,  output,  
income  and profit. It could  be argued  that a better  premise  or starting  point  would  be to 
acknowledge  the real world and not the fantasy  world of unproven  riches from 
ascending  the value added  chain. Increasingly  there is a view that firms should  think 
very carefully  before  moving  away from their competence  i.e. what they really  excel at 
(think of a competence  in terms of Honda and small engines,  Sony in miniature  
electronics).  This is made up of the knowledge  they possess,  their accumulated  
learning,  their technologies  and how these all come together  to produce  products  or 
solutions  that are defining  either  in final product  form or as an essential  element  in final 
product.  Too often,  for reasons  of fashion,  for stock market  approval  or the ambition  of 
executives,  companies  move into new areas  of activity,  believing  these to offer better 
rewards.  Such moves  are rarely  successful.
There  are several  reports  on the milk industry  that dwell on the need for scale. Usually  
it is about  production  scale, rarely  about  relative  scale in market  or product  segments.  
However,  the latter is of huge importance,  particularly  where  price is not the attribute.
160
which secured  it. Scale should  be the outcome  of having  an advantage  in product  or 
process. It should  not be confused  with size. Size can be built. Scale needs  to be 
earned.
For the past decade  or so, talk has been about industry  concentration  - playing  the 
savings  game. This is a finite game. It adds no value per se, merely  redistributing  
existing  value. It only adds value if the savings  generated  are re-invested  and are not 
immediately  distributed.  This has not happened. So what's so great about  
rationalisation?  There  is no vision in a policy  of rationalisation  if all it leads to is dis­
investment  in the sector. This may not be a problem  today in the milk processing  
industry, but it could be so in a quota-less  environment.  A unique focus on 
rationalisation  is the outcome  of a mindset  that is tired, one that sees the horizon  as the 
limit and not as the standing  point from which  to view another  one. It is one which is 
essentially  closed  to future  possibilities,  a minder  rather  than a creator,  one that prefers  
the known  to uncertainty  and one that is probably  more process  than product  driven,  
more production  than consumer  want driven.
j It is unlikely  that the future  of milk processing  will be defined  in, or as a consequence  of,
' an industry  report. It will be defined  by change  which the prevailing  culture  enables;  
whether  by a change  agent, innovator,  strategist  or however  you define  anyone  who 
refuses  to accept  things  as given,  as immutable,  or the natural  right of long established  
parties  and who passionately  pursues  his\her  dream.  Initially  this will be decried,  fought  
, against,  but ultimately  it will be followed  if it is perceived  to have a high probability  of 
t success.  Followers  are just that - followers.  Leadership  is what counts. In business,  
leadership  results  in better  margins  and better  returns  on capital.
Change  involves  displacement,  and so it may be that some existing  operators  will be 
pushed  aside in this process.  So be it. Establishment  payers  are authors  of their own 
downfall.  To try and protect  these  is to stand  against  change.  This is pointless,  however  
apparently  initially  successful.  It’s a bit like the canal barge  operators.  Building  bigger  
, barges  appeared  smart for price reasons  because  there was still a market  for barge  
transport  well into the railway  era. This is consistent  with how markets  (i.e. people  
behave). There is always  a minority  of late adopters  of change,  but eventually  this 
minority  becomes  too small to support  an industry,  however  rationalised  it may be.
If the milk processing  industry  is to develop,  and adapt  to a changing  environment,  it 
must evolve a culture  that if not at the edge, is equally  not opposed  to change.  
Knowledge  and technology,  education  and training,  as key influences  of beliefs,  
meaning  and values,  are drivers  of culture,  and as a country  we must invest  in these  if 
we want to be leaders  in milk processing.  This is possible  but we are not good at this 
kind of central  policy  making  and planning.  So ultimately,  change  in the milk processing  
sector  will be led by innovative  individuals.
In the physical  world,  the organism  cannot  advance  ahead  of environmental  change.  
But in the human  world it is possible  to dream  or imagine  a world  quite different  to what  
exists and to do things,  which cause  the world to adapt  to our dream  or imagination.  
This is what innovators  do. Biology  informs  you that an organism,  which  is not adapted  
to, or is not capable  of adapting  to a changing  environment,  will perish. Not quite the 
same fate, at least not so quickly,  awaits  a firm or an industry,  which  fails to adapt.
161
In large part, farmers  control  the milk processing  industry,  directly  or indirectly.  Their 
stakeholding  (as suppliers,  shareholders,  indeed customers)  is substantial.  Thus 
potentially  farmers  are significant  agents  of change,  but they are also stout defenders  
of the status  quo. Where  they stand  will depend  on which  role they play - defender or 
attacker. Behaviour  will be influenced  accordingly.  Whichever  role and mindset  
predominates,  this will shape  the business  and industry  given the ownership  structure.  
For example,  if farmers  measure  performance  exclusively  by reference  to the short 
term, then almost  certainly  they will preside  over organisations  which  are anti-change,  
which recruit  people  of this mindset  and which leave progress  and wealth  potential  to 
others,  the others  in this case being  overseas.
Farmers  have a crucial role to play in the development  of the industry. The dairy 
industry  is what  it is, not in spite of farmers,  but because  of farmers.  However,  too often 
they behave  as though  they have no responsibility,  that they are victims  in the equation.  
This can be used to legitimise  their demands  - demands  that may be excessive  or 
inconsistent  with sustainability,  never  mind progress.  If the industry  cannot  be said to 
be in rude health  strategically  or operationally,  and if a strategy  is required  to change  
this then farmers  have a key role to play. A big change  in attitude  on their part is 
required.  However,  it is naive  to suppose  that it is only farmers  who may need a change  
of attitude. Their representative  organisations  need to change to ones whose  
convictions  transcend  political  self-interest.  Governance  needs  wholesale  change.  It is 
no longer  acceptable  that farm production  has precedence.  Education  and training  
establishments  need  to be re-missioned.  The focus  of food science  education  needs  to 
change  with consumer  wants  rather  than milk its starting  point. Food research  needs  to 
become  more independent  of food corporates  and needs  to be de-coupled  from fee 
income.
Milk is a great  product.  The issue  is whether  we can make  the most  of it. This is a huge 
challenge  for the industry,  and there is no doubt  that there will be significant  individual  
successes.  However,  industry  wide success  demands  a big culture  change. The 
question  is: who is going  to lead this?
162
A Vision  for the Future
MIKE MURPHY  
Innisfree,  Rathpeacon,  Co. Cork
Four key questions  must be addressed:-  
I • Has the dairy  industry  a vision  for the future?  No.
I 2 Is it critically  important  that the dairy  industry  has a clear  vision  for the future?  Yes.
• Why? Otherwise  9 out of 10 dairy farmers  will either  be out of business  or 
living  in poverty  within  10 years.
• What  should  happen  now? The challenge  to the industry  is to develop  a clear  
future  vision  and then make  that vision  happen.
Success  in life and in all business  activity  is based  on: 
o excellent  leaders,  who
o develop  a clear  future  vision  for their businesses,  and 
o have a well thought-through  strategic  plan to turn that vision  into reality.
What  challenges  do we now face?
After nearly 30 years of highly protected  markets,  the twin forces of WTO and EU 
enlargement  are inevitably  grinding  towards  a less protected  and sheltered  future.  
Already  globalisation  of food companies  has lead to a hugely  competitive  food market.  
The 20 largest  food companies  in the world 18 months  ago have now reduced  to 10 
companies,  either  through  a process  of merger  or acquisition.  This change  is leading  
to a level of competitive  challenge,  which is totally unprecedented.  Irish dairy  
companies  who have stood still in recent  years  have in practise  lost ground. Standing  
still means  going  backwards  fast in today ’s savagely  competitive  marketplace.
There is ever-increasing  buying power of a highly concentrated  retail sector. It is 
predicted  that by 2005  the top 10 food retailers  in the EU will control  90% of retail sales.  
Irish food firms will need reasonable  scale  to be able to fully service  multinational  retail  
chains, or multinational  food service  chains like MacDonald’ s. Scale and product  
differentiation  will be necessary  to counter  the buying  power  of the huge retail chains.  
Grow  or die!
Food scares  in Europe  (BSE and Foot and Mouth)  have led directly  to a ’greening ’ of 
EU agricultural  policy. Policy  makers  who are imposing  ever more bureaucratic  and 
costly  requirements  on EU farmers  are largely  ignoring  scientific  fact. Our competitors  
outside  the EU will not follow  this policy.
An ageing  dairy farming  sector,  where  92% of farmers  are now over 36 years  old, will 
find the challenge  of adapting  to a less protected  era very difficult  indeed.  The need for 
energetic  young blood is obvious. The farm organisations,  especially  the IFA, while  
hiding behind  the coat tails of the Department  of Agriculture  have totally  blocked  any 
real opportunity  for young  people  entering  farming.  The lack of longer  term thinking  by
163
the farm organizations  is a huge competitive  disadvantage  for the dairy sector.
A product  mix that is still largely commodity  dependent  will be a major area of 
vulnerability  for the future. Again the exceptionally  short-term  policies  of the farm 
organizations  are a major  barrier  to the necessary  heavy  investment  in the key factors  
that drive long-term  business  success  in the international  marketplaces.  My contention 
is that, in these  areas  the farm organizations  are acting  directly  against  the longer-term 
interests  of farmers.  The question  has to be asked  - are the farm organizations  capable  
of taking a long-term  strategic  view? Farm organisations  could learn from how 
institutions  and analysts  measure  and assess  public  companies.  Institutions  expect  to 
see a clear strategy  from public  companies.  They then measure  these  companies  on 
how successfully  they implement  their strategies  over time. Are targets  met? Reward  
or sanction  is then based  on measured  performance.  In order  to secure  future  returns  
dairy farmers  will need to invest  more in their industry.  This is not to endorse  a blank  
cheque. Farmers  will accept a lower milk price to support  well thought  through  
strategies,  which  will deliver  better,  or more secure,  future returns. The plan must be 
100%  measurable  with clear  targets.  Results  will have to be delivered  within  an agreed  
time span. Everything  should  be geared  to better  returns  to farmers  over time, based  
on performance  in the international  marketplace.
We know  from our political  masters  that farmers  will receive  a dairying  premium  - i.e. a 
cheque  in the post of 9.2 p/gallon  in 2007, in exchange  for a milk price support  cut of 
17.1 pp/gallon.  It is anticipated  that in 2007 milk price plus premium  will be about  8% 
lower  than the current  milk price. Higher  inflation  in Ireland  (relative  to the rest of EU), 
coupled  with falling  commodity  prices,  are at the moment  leading  to a deterioration  in 
our trading  terms  of about  5% per annum  in real terms. Increased  efficiency  can offset  
only part of this loss. Present  official  policy,  which  prevents  the necessary  up scaling  to 
absorb  the ensuing  sharp  yearly  loss of income,  isn’t sustainable.  It is gradually  putting  
more  and more  farmers  into a poverty  trap. The need again  for clear  long term planning  
is very urgent. Without  a clear  vision  for the future  many  of todays  farmers  will not be 
here in 7 -10 years.
What  of the future?
The challenges  are formidable.  The critical  point  is the lack of clear  policy. We currently  
have no realistic  vision  for the future. There  are some notable  exceptions,  but in the 
main we lack good leadership,  which  will face up to and overcome  some  very difficult  
challenges.  The following  illustrates  what can happen  when someone  ignores  major  
change. If you put a frog into a pot of boiling  water,  the scalded  frog will quickly jump 
out and save himself. If however,  the frog is put into a pot, which  is gently  heated,  the 
frog won ’t fully realise  the growing  threat  and will be boiled  to death.
If we carry on as now, huge and traumatic  change  is inevitable,  but if we have a real 
vision  for the future  - we can hop out of the pot quickly  and shape  an excellent  future.  
Two very relevant  examples  where  good leadership  and clear vision  have dramatically  
turned  things  around  are worth looking  at to illustrate  this point.

The Irish economic  miracle
The Irish economy  was badly  mismanaged  by all political  parties  from 1977  - 1986. We 
ran up sky-high  debt, had crippling  unemployment,  rampant  emigration,  and high taxes.  
Many will remember  the misery,  doom and gloom  of the period. In 1987 the 2 main 
political  parties  under Haughey,  McSharry  and Dukes  came together  via the Tallaght  
Strategy ’ and shaped  a highly  effective  national  vision  of better  prosperity  and increased  
employment.  All the main national  partners  bought  into this vision. The result  was the 
Irish economic  miracle. Employment  rose from 1.1 million  to 1.7 million. Taxes  were  
slashed,  national  debt as a percentage  of GNP fell by two thirds. This was a triumph  of 
clear vision,  fashioned  by good leadership,  overcoming  highly  difficult  circumstances.
The Kerry  story
When  a Tony O’Reilly  led Dairy Board  first branded  Irish butter  35 years  ago they chose  
the name  “Kerry Gold ” because  Kerry  was the one area in the country  that everybody  
expected  would never have a worthwhile  dairy industry. It just wasn ’t conceivable.  
Impossible?  Eddie  Hayes,  Frank  Wall and a few other  farmers  with a vision,  believed  
in the future  and hired a 27-year-old  kid called  Denis  Brosnan.  Aided  - not hindered  by 
a major  brucellosis  problem  that rocked  Kerry  in 1979  -1981,  Kerry  put in place  a vision  
to become  a world-class  food and high added  value  differentiated  ingredients  business,  
a business,  which  would  never  again  be dependent  on commodity  products,  a business  
that created  considerable  wealth  for Kerry  farmers  and shareholders.  Today,  Kerry  is a 
world-leader  in its field, and the Kerry  success  story is set to run and run.
What led to the success  of Kerry  and the Irish economy,  and allowed  each to overcome  
daunting  challenges?  The answer  is crystal  clear. Superb  leadership  and a clear  vision  
for the future. Therefore  the challenge  to the Irish dairy industry  today, must be to put 
into place  a well thought  through  success  plan for the future.
We have realistic  grounds  for optimism  if we get our act into gear:
• We have a long grass growing  season  - a major competitive  advantage  if well 
utilised.
• Demand  for milk worldwide  is growing  faster  than milk supply. Meat proteins,  hit by 
health  concerns,  are losing  market  share. This is allowing  milk and soya proteins  to 
grow quite strongly.  Intervention  stores  in Europe  are empty  of dairy products;  also 
cheese  consumption  in Europe  is growing  quickly.
• Milk has long been recognised  for its superb  functional  characteristics  but a most  
encouraging  development  has been the emerging  evidence  that the long medical  
campaign  against  dairy products  is based  on a false premise.
• Dairy products  are good for your health. Milk has many healthy  nutraceutical  
benefits.  In particular,  the high CLA  content  of grass-produced  milk will lead to major  
opportunities  for a pastoral  dairying  country  like Ireland. However  we must get the 
real facts out to consumers.  This will take major resources,  and after years of 
misinformation  consumers  will need to be retold repeatedly  that milk is a wonderful  
product.
165
• We also have full access  to a marketplace  of 370 million  affluent  consumers.
So there  are real opportunities  in the marketplace,  but only the swift and able will grasp  
these. Will we fully grasp  these opportunities?  Not with present  policies. We must  
change  and change  now. We must develop  a vision  for the future,  a vision  that in 10 
years time we have a positive,  dynamic,  growing  Irish dairy industry  which is highly  
competitive  internationally  at every level, and providing  good incomes  and careers  to 
people  at all levels  of that industry.  This contrasts  with the doom  and gloom  of present 
predictions  of only 10,000  milk suppliers  in 10 years. If the appropriate  policy  changes 
are made  now, then we can have 15,000  to 20,000  dairy farmers  in 10 years  time.
Some  elements  of necessary  change
We have  an over dependence  on commodity  milk products,  and little progress  has been  
made  on this over the years. Why so? Are their success  stories  we can learn from?
The Danish  Dairy  Industry
Twelve  years  ago the Danes  had a huge exposure  to feta cheese  - a commodity  they 
sold largely  in the Middle  East. They then took a decision  to invest substantially  in 
growing  their share  of the European  cheese  market. Heavy  sustained  investments  in 
product  and market  development  have  led to much  lower  commodity  dependence  today.  
Danish  farmers  thought  of long term market  success,  agreed  to take lower milk prices  
and are now much better  strategically  placed  for a more secure  future.
Kerry
In 1980/81  Kerry  realised  that selling  via a broker,  i.e. the Irish Dairy  Board,  would  never  
quickly  achieve  a reduction  in commodity  dependence.  So Kerry  integrated  production, 
marketing  and R&D within Kerry. This was the key step in Kerry ’s present  success.  
This demanded  a huge commitment  of very scarce  resources  for the then very small  
Kerry  Co-operative.  It had to be done if Kerry  was to achieve  real market  power. Now 
Kerry has about 450 scientists,  and a marketing  strength  far in excess  of the Dairy  
Board.
[Note: None of the Irish co-ops  who want to sell high value hi-tech  food ingredients  to 
the major food multinationals  can hope to compete  successfully  operating  through  a 
broker  like the Dairy  Board,  against  fully integrated  operations  like Kerry  Group. For this 
reason,  the New Zealand  Dairy Board - which has always  been by far the most 
effective,  centralised  milk selling  agent  in the world has just integrated  backwards  with 
98% of the NZ manufacturing  industry].
Fully integrated  dairy companies,  which  continually  meet with their customers,  are far 
more responsive  to market  signals.  Trying  to compete  via a broker  like the Irish Dairy  
Board  is like trying  to fight a boxing  match  with one arm tied behind  your back. Going  
via a broker  does not work. We have to change.  Let’s learn from Kerry Group. Their  
success  is based  on:
• Superb  leadership
• Clear  vision
166
• Fully integrated  production,  marketing  and R&D, and a willingness  to invest long 
term in the key drivers  of their business  i.e. highly  skilled  people,  R&D, global  reach,  
strong  market  positions  in selected  segments,  well selected  acquisitions  to acquire  
key new technologies,  key new customers,  and enhance  market  share
• Scale. It is estimated  that Kerry Group  will have sales in 2002 of ^3.8 billion. Yet 
Denis Brosnan  believes  that this is quite limiting  and Kerry needs  to have sales of 
above  ^5 billion  within  2 or 3 years  to remain  competitive  at world level!
To have a secure  future  we must set a goal of reducing  commodity  dependence  by 
perhaps  3 to 4 % per annum. Thus the aim should  be that in 5 years  we would  have 
approximately  20% more products  sold in non-commodity  form. To achieve  this we will 
need:
• Clear  vision  over time
• Huge  structural  change  which will give scale and also integration  of production,  
marketing  and R&D.
• Heavy  investment  in people,  product,  and market  development.  This investment  will 
be for an agreed  plan, which  is measurable.  Targets  must be completely  transparent  
and the executive  management  of dairy companies  will be measured  on 
performance  relative  to targets.
A failure  to plan is a major  limiting  factor. Failing  to plan is planning  to fail.
At farm level, farmers  and researchers  will need to get together  to tackle  the following  
issues.
• Low capital  costs  - identify  innovative  ways of housing,  feeding,  milking  cows and 
rearing  calves  etc at low cost. To grow  the industry,  the capital  cost of expansion  will 
have to be low. Can we identify  a pathway  to converting  farms  from non-dairy  uses 
to dairying  at a total infrastructure  cost of £600  - 700/cow?
• Low operational  cost  - this has to be centred  on maximum  use of pasture.  If we can 
regularly  achieve  milk solid outputs  of 1100 - 1200 kg/ha on systems  where  +75%  
of a cows total dry matter  intake  is coming  from grazed  grass  then we will be very 
competitive  relative  to all European  countries.  To achieve  this we will need to have  
well researched  systems  where  cows calve rapidly,  and go directly  onto pasture.  
This type of system  reduces  feed costs, labour,  veterinary  and capital  costs.
• Labour  productivity  - we need systems  that allow high productivity  but are also 
people  friendly. It’s a big challenge.  The present  ‘Labour  Use Study ’ at Moorepark  
is an excellent  example  of how researchers  and farmers  need to work together  
harmoniously  and respectfully,  while also being open to robust  and forceful  debate  
and discussion.
• Low wastage  - seasonal  calving  isn’t sustainable  with low fertility. We have major  
problems  in this area,  which  must  be quickly  overcome.  Good  survivability  and good  
fertility  are critical  success  factors  for our low cost pastoral  based  seasonal  systems.
Excellent  research  focussing  on low cost systems  has been hugely  valuable  to farmers  
from the early days of Moorepark.  However,  my contention  is that research  work in 
most of the 90’s focused  excessively  on achieving  high production  per cow, rather  than
167
achieving  high profit under Irish conditions.  The refocussing  on high profit in recent  
years  is welcome.  Our competitive  advantage  lies in producing  high quality  milk cheaply  
from pasture,  which  has a ‘clean, green image'. To this farmers  must be prepared  to 
fund good research.  It is an investment  that will give excellent  returns. Every  industry  
needs  continuing  well-focused  innovation  to stay competitive  over time.
Extension  and education  must also face up to new challenges  and realities.  With the 
exception  of some  private  companies,  this is largely  the remit of Teagasc.  In relation  to 
dairy  farmers,  there  is a perception  that the service  offered  is not relevant  to their needs,  
and that some  advisors  have little understanding  of what  profit  and return  on investment 
is really  about. Some  farmers  have  been encouraged  to spend  large  amounts  of money  
in hopelessly  low return  areas. These  issues  must  be addressed  at the earliest  possible  
opportunity.  It is suggested  that Teagasc  needs  to give priority  to increasing  farmers  
incomes  and net worth,  and that some  degree  of performance  measurement  would  go 
a long way to restoring  confidence  in the service  offered.
The challenge  for management  to turn things  around.  Clear  and measurable  goals  are 
required,  with the objective  of putting  more  money  in farmers ’ pockets.  There  is a need 
to adequately  reward  those  advisors  that successfully  deliver  on these  goals. The Irish 
dairy industry  cannot  progress  and compete  in the international  arena  without  access  to 
a technically  competent,  well funded  extension  and education  service.
In Summary
At present  there is lack of clear  vision  (arguably  no vision  at all?) A clear  vision  for the 
industry  is urgently  required  in order  to secure  a prosperous  farming  future  for a large 
number  of Irish dairy farmers.  Real changes  (not cosmetic  changes)  have to be made  
now - today  for future  success.  The challenge  to all segments  of the industry  is to come  
together  to agree and secure  a vision for the future. If we respond  strongly  to the 
challenge  then present  difficulties  will be overcome,  and we can develop  a vibrant  
industry,  which will provide  opportunity,  prosperity  and a good future for Irish dairy 
farmers!
