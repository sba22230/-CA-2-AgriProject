Introduction
Endoparasitic  infections  In farm animals  are a concern  in terms of both welfare  and 
productivity.  This is reflected  in the significant  part anthelmintics  play in the animal  health  
market. In 2003, sales of animal  health  products  in Ireland  were valued  at €92 million  of 
which anthelmintics  accounted  for 27%, indicating  the importance  of worms  (Animal  and 
Plant Health  Association,  2004). Currently  there are only 3 groups  of broad-spectrum  
anthelmintics  available  on the market  (Table  1). The value  of anthelmintic-based  approach  
in controlling  parasites  Is under threat because  of the emergence  of anthelmintic 
resistance.  Anthelmintic  resistance  has now been reported  worldwide  with the magnitude  
of the problem  being much greater  in the southern  hemisphere  (Coles.  2002). In this 
paper, some of the current recommendations  in the literature  aimed at delaying  
anthelmintic  resistance  will be reviewed  against  a background  of the information  gathered  
in Irish flocks over the past few years with respect  to parasite  control practices  and 
anthelmintic  resistance  on lowland  farms.

While  the full prevalence  of anthelmintic  resistant  nematodes  in sheep  flocks  in the UK Is 
unknown,  there are good indications  that resistance  to benzimidazoles  in particular  is 
high For example,  in a study conducted  by Keith Hunt in southeast  England,  on farms  
that were interested  in having  resistance  tests done. 80% had benzimidazole  resistant  
nematodes,  37% had levamisole  resistant  nematodes  and 30% had worms  resistant  to 
both groups  (Coles. 2002). In Scotland,  64% of farms surveyed  showed  evidence  of 
benzimidazole  resistant  worm populations  but there was no evidence  for levamisole  
resistance  (Bartley  et al.. 2003). A disturbing  development  has been a case report of 
multiple  anthelmintic  resistance  (i e roundworms  resistant  to all 3 broad  spectrum  drugs:  
benzimidazole,  levamisole  and ivermectin)  in Scotland  (Sargison  et al.. 2001)
The extent  of anthelmintic  resistance  in Ireland  is largely  unknown,  but the first evidence  
for benzimidazole  resistance  in sheep  was reported  by O’Brien in 1992, A summary  of 
investigations  concerned  with anthelmintic  resistance  in Irish flocks up to 2002 is 
presented  in Table 2. With the exception  of the study by Good et al.. (2003),  
benzimidazole  was the only anthelmintic  tested. This study was prompted  by results  of 
poor drug efficacy  in flocks involved  in a partnership  project  with Teagasc  Technology  
Evaluation  and Transfer  As part of this project,  faecal  egg counts  (FEC)  were monitored
on a number  of farms using FECPAK  technology,  developed  In New Zealand 
this DIY technology  may be found in an earlier  paper  (Good,  2000),Details  of

**AR = Anthelmintic  Resistance
While in general  the faecal egg counts results determined  over 3 grazing  seasons  
reflected  reasonable  parasite  control  on most farms, there was prima facia evidence  of 
an efficacy  problem  with regard  to benzimidazole  on 5 farms In one case this was clearly  
attributable  to a faulty closing gun. This prompted  the more detailed  evaluation  of 
anthelmintic  efficacy  on these farms (Good et al.. 2003). Subsequently,  a faecal egg 
count  reduction  test was undertaken  on 11 farms  (7 in Wicklow  and 4 in Monaghan)  in the 
autumn Individual  faecal  samples  were taken  from 30 ewe lamb replacements,  uniquely  
identified,  on each farnn After  the faecal  sampling,  15 lambs  were given a benzimidazole  
product  and 15 lambs  were given a levamisole  product On the return visit (between  10 
and 14 days post-treatment)  faecal samples  were again taken from these lambs Two 
farms  were removed  form the study as the average  flock FEC was too low to run the test 
(Coles  et al. 1992) As shown in table 2, evidence  for benzimidazole  resistance  was 
evident  in 7 out of 9 farms Evidence  for levamisole  resistance  was found  on 3 out of the 
9 farms tested while on 3 farms there was evidence  for both benzimidazole  and 
levamisole  resistance  (Good  et al., 2003) In 2004, this work was extended  to a survey  
conducted  by Patten  et al. to examine  parasite  control  practices  and the prevalence  of 
anthelmintic  resistance  on lowland  sheep  farms in Ireland. Farms  with greater  than 100 
ewes and a long-term  lowland  sheep enterprise  were surveyed  (116 flocks) about  
parasite  control  practices  In this study  the method  used to detect  resistance  was a larval  
development  assay, which involved  the incubation  of fresh parasite  eggs in various  
concentrations  of the anthelmintic  drug If larvae develop  from eggs incubated  in a 
medium  containing  what is known  as the discriminating  dose of the drug then resistant  
iarvae  are present  (Coles,  2005). Preliminary  evidence,  using this discriminating  dose as 
the cut-off,  suggests  that there  is a high incidence  of resistance  to benzimidazoles  (>70%)  
and levamisoles  (>20%) in the flocks examined  (n=66 flocks; Patten et al. 2004,  
unpublished)
Living  with anthelmintic  resistance
From the evidence  above,  it is clear  that Irish flock owners  need to be fully aware  that the 
development  of anthelmintic  resistance  is in progress  on many farms. As there are no 
effective  ‘non-anthelmintic ’-based  roundworm  control  measures  available,  it is clear that 
anthelmintic  efficacy  needs to be preserved  and a serious  effort has to be made to 
minimise  the development  of resistance. The crucial question “how anthelmintic 
resistance  can be delayed"  has been the subject  of much literature  (Coles  and Roush,  
1992: Coles, 2002: Stubbings,  2003: Abbot et al., 2004), Against  a background  of an 
increasing  prevalence  of anthelmintic  resistance  in sheep  nematodes  on farms  in the UK. 
parasite  control  measures  have been reappraised  in order to develop  a set of national  
strategies  and recommendations  to slow the development  of resistance  (Stubbings,  2003,  
Abbot  et al.. 2004). The key elements  to developing  a sustainable  control  strategy  on the 
farm identified  are:
the effective  administration  of anthelmintics 
only dosing  when necessary  
using the appropriate  anthelmintic 
reducing  the dependence  on anthelmintics
avoiding  the introduction  of resistance  onto a farm by treating  purchased  stock  
regular  testing  for anthelmintic  resistance  
maintaining  a susceptible  population  of worms.
A comprehensive  manual  (Abbot  et at., 2004)  detailing  these  recommendations  has been  
published by SCOPS (Sustainable  Control of Parasites in Sheep) 
(www.nationalsheeD.ora.ukt
Results  from the survey on worm treatment  practices  on Irish lowland  sheep farms  
(n=164)  by Patten  et al. (2005)  revealed  wide variation  in treatment  practices  and highlight  
that some changes  would be appropriate  if the selection  for anthelmintic  resistance  is to 
be reduced.  Judging  whether  animals  require  treatment  involves  the careful  monitoring  of 
animal  performance  and faecal  egg counts  (FEC). As discussed  previously  (Good,  2000)  
the determination  of faecal  egg counts  is the only practical  method  available  to measure  
parasite  burden  and is a valuable  tool in informing  decisions  regarding  the timing and 
appropriate  use of anthelmintics.  FEC can be determined  through  the services  of the 
veterinary  laboratories  or more recently  by DIY technology  (FECPAK©,  New Zealand).  It 
is clear from the results of Patten et al. (2005) that over 99% of flock owners  used 
anthelmintics  to control parasites  and that over 80% followed  a set programme  in 
delivering  anthelmintics  to lambs  (Figure  1). The majority  of farms  (92%)  administered  a 
minimum  of 3 anthelmintic  treatments  to lambs  per annum  (Patten  et al.. 2005).
The recommendation  that anthelmintics  should be used as effectively  as possible  is 
unchanged.  Using the correct  dose rate (dose  at the rate recommended  for the heaviest  
in the group),  correct  drench  technique  (dose  over the back of the tongue),  checking  the 
calibration  of the dosing gun are all crucial. In determining  the correct amount  of 
anthelmintic  to be administered  to lambs,  53% of farmers  stated that they weighed  and 
treated  according  to the heaviest  lamb (Figure  2). Guessing  the weight  and dosing  to the 
average  weight  of the group,  as reported  by the remaining  flock owners,  will likely lead to 
under-dosing  of a significant  proportion  of the lambs in the flock and encourage  the 
development  of resistance.  While over 89% of farmers  reported  th': they checked  the 
accuracy  of the dosing  gun, over 30% of these admitted  that this was done only on an 
irregular  basis (Patten  ef al., 2005).

Restricting  feed for 12 to 24 hours (but with access  to water) prior to drenching  with 
benzimidazole  or macrocyclic  lactone  has been shown  to improve  the efficacy  of these  
drugs. Withholding  feed has the effect  of reducing  rumen  fill, slowing  the rate of digesta  
flow and prolonging  the length  of time that the parasite  is exposed  to the drug (Hennessy,  
1997) It must be emphasised  though  that this should  only be practiced  when  it is unlikely  
to cause  harm (i,e never  in ewes in late pregnancy)  (Stubbings,  2003,  Abbot  et at . 2004),  
From the survey  results  28% of Irish lowland  farmers  reported  that they withheld  food 
before dosing lambs. It was not clear from the survey whether  this practice  was 
anthelmintic  class specific  (i,e, benzimadazole,  levamisole,  macrocyclic  lactone)  but in 
the majority  of cases  the duration  of the withholding  period  was more  that 6 hours  but less 
than 12 hours  (Patten  et al.. 2005)  and therefore  insufficient

With a high prevalence  of anthelmintic  resistance,  it is now considered  advisable  to treat 
all bought-in  sheep  with a drug from the macrocylclic  lactone  drug class and a drug from 
the levamisole  drug class These  drugs  should  not be mixed  but given as separate  doses  
(sequentially).  Following  treatment  these  sheep  should  be kept off pasture  for at least 24 
hours The reasoning  behind  the use of two products  is that macrocylclic  lactone  will 
remove  all parasites  that might be resistant  to benzimidazole  and levamisole  (but not 
those resistant  to macrocylclic  lactone)  and that levamisole  will remove  all parasites  
resistant  to macrocylclic  lactone  (Stubbings,  2003:  Abbot  et al. 2004). The retention  time 
post-treatment  is to minimise  the risk of any anthelmintic  resistant  parasites  surviving  on 
pasture. This recommendation  would also apply to sheep being returned  to the home  
farm that had been grazing  land where  the status  of anthelmintic  resistance  is unknown  
e g. rented land/land  used by a number  of flock owners According  to the survey  
conducted  by Patten  et al. a high percentage  of farms (93%) reported  that they treated  
purchased  livestock  prior to mixing with the rest of the flock. Over 70% of farmers  
reported  that the product  used to treat these purchased  animals  would be the same one 
as that being used in the current  year. Of the farms  that reported  that they would use a 
different  product,  69% used a product  from macrocylclic  lactone  class only (Patten  et 
a/,,unpublished  2004),
Historically,  most recommendations  on dosing  strategies  supported  the concept  of 'dose  
and move' as a successful  method  in achieving  good control  of the effect of worms  on 
lamb performance.  Lambs  dosed and moved  to graze pastures  with low level of worm  
challenge  ensured  that pasture  contamination  remained  low for an extended  period of 
time, thus providing  a window  of opportunity  where  parasite  infection  did not impact  on 
lamb growth  and recourse  to anthelmintic  treatment  was unnecessary  (Abbot  et al.. 2004).  
It is now recognised  that this approach  is likely to be highly  selective  for resistance  since  
any worms  that survive  treatment  will benefit  from having  an extended  period  of time for 
reproduction  over unselected  worms. All the time that sheep remain  free of re-infection  
from the “low-contamination ” pasture,  any worms  that survived  treatment  within  the sheep  
will be contaminating  the pastures  with their eggs thus increasing  the proportion  of 
anthelmintic  resistant,  free-living  infective  larvae  on the pasture.  Any sheep  grazing  this 
pasture  will subsequently  be subject  to a worm population  that is more resistant  than 
before This scenario  (dose  and move to low contaminated  pasture)  repeated  on a farm 
over several  years can eventually  lead to a situation  where the parasite  population  is 
highly  resistant  (Abbot  et al., 2004). About  50% of Irish farmers  surveyed  reported  a dose  
and move to 'clean'  grass as a routine  practice  (Patten  et al.. unpublished  2004)  (Figure  
3). Two approaches  as to how a farmer  may reap the production  advantages  of a low- 
contamination  pasture  without  penalising  future chemotherapeutic  options  by heavily  
selecting  for anthelmintic  resistance  have been suggested;  (i) delay the 'move'  after the 
treatment  and (ii) part-flock'  treatment.  (Stubbing  2003,  Abbot  et al.. 2004)
Delaying  the movement  of treated  sheep  to "low-contamination"  pasture  allows  the flock 
to become  lightly reinfected  so that so that the sheep  bring a mixed population  of both 
resistant  and susceptible  parasites  to the new pasture  (Stubbings,  2003; Abbot et al.. 
2004), The length  of time that the sheep  should  remain  grazing  on contaminated  pasture  
before  moving  them to the low- contamination"  pasture  will be influenced  by variations  in 
pasture  infectivity  (i.e. the number  of infective  larvae  on the pastured  and climatic  factors  
which  favour  parasite  survival Abbot  et al (2004)  have suggested  t':-1 if the pastures  are 
of high infectivity  and the sheep  are vulnerable  to parasites  (e g. lambs  during  their first 
grazing  season)  then ‘4 to 7 days of grazing'  on the contaminated  pasture  'may be a 
satisfactory  compromise  between  making  the best use of the clean pasture  resource  and

lambs  moved  to ‘clean ’ grazing  after dosing
reducing  the selection  pressure  for anthelmintic  resistance ’ However  where  drugs  with 
a persistent  activity  are used, it has been suggested  that it would  be better  to move  then 
dose, but details  on the level of flock infection  and subsequent  challenge  on the pasture  
would be essential  in gauging  the best time to treat (Molento  et al.. 2004; Coles,  2005),  
The second  approach,  which  would  also reduce  the selection  for anthelmintic  resistance  
involves  leaving  a sub group  of the flock, untreated  before  a move to low' contaminated  
pasture This untreated  sub group of lambs  would subsequently  contaminate  the ‘low- 
contamination ’ field with a population  of unselected  parasites  (thus diluting the 
contamination  that might happen  from worms  that survived  treatment  in the treated  
lambs)  (Stubbings,  2003;  Abbot  et al., 2004). Of concern,  would  be which  sheep  to leave  
untreated  and the concession  that the low infection  status of a clean' field is now 
shortened Essentially  this approach  is 'a compromise  between  some lower level of 
production  because  of a reduction  in worm control  and a higher risk of selection  for 
anthelmintic  resistance ’ (Abbot  et al., 2004).
Conclusions
The increased  prevalence  of anthelmintic  resistance  compels  every  flock owner  to take a 
fresh look at his or her current  parasite  control practices. As important  today, as 
yesterday,  successful  worm  treatment  relies  on effective  on-farm  management  practices  
Fundamental  questions,  which  need to be asked,  are:
• When  and if I need to treat?
• Do I know  the efficacy  of the drugs  that I am using?
• How can I delay the development  or spread  anthelmintic  resistance?
As no equally-effective  non-anthelmintic-based  roundworm  control measures  are 
available  and if animal  health,  productivity  (and profitability)  are to be maintained  then it 
is clear that anthelmintic  efficiency  needs  to be preserved  and serious  efforts  must be 
made

Introduction
For farmers  involved  in mid-season  lamb production,  the general  aim is to produce  
suitable  lambs  for sale mainly  in the June to September  period. It is desirable  to achieve  
high lamb growth rates on grazed pasture,  with a minimum  reliance  on creep feed 
Specific  targets  may vary from farm to farm: -
• achieve  high lamb growth  rates on pasture  only pre and post weaning.  Draft a high 
proportion  of lambs  (70 to 80%), by mid September,  with the remainder  either sold as 
stores  or finished  in late autumn.
• Aim for a higher  performance  with over 90% drafted  by mid September.  This may 
require  a small input of creep  feed.
• Some may want to have lambs  drafted  earlier,  with over 90% drafted  by late August 
This will generally  require  a higher  input of creep  feed.
Each of these targets can be achieved  with appropriate  grazing management  and 
strategic  use of creep  feed.
Lamb  weaning  weight
The average  weight  of lambs  at weaning  (age 98 days/14  weeks)  gives a good indication  
of flock  performance,  and which  of the above  three targets  (if any) will be achieved  The 
figures  in Table 1 give a range  of weaning  weights  that may be recorded  on farms  without 
creep  feeding A twin lamb, weighing  4 kg at birth, 32 kg at weaning  and drafted  at 42 kg 
will have achieved  74% of its total live-weight  gain by weaning.  High weaning  weights  are, 
therefore,  critical  where  early drafting  of lambs  is required.  Given  that typical  growth  rates  
of lambs, on grass only, post weaning  average  about 1 kg/week,  each reduction  in 
weaning  weight  of 1 kg will delay  the average  sale date by 1 week.
Table 1. Average  weaning  weight  (kg) of lambs  at 14 weeks  without  creep  feeding
Low Medium High
28-30 31-33 33-35
The low weaning  weights  would suggest  serious  problems  with grassland  management 
The medium  weights  should  be achievable  on most farms,  with set stocking  or paddock  
grazing,  even at moderately  high stocking  rates The high weaning  weights  are more  
easily  achieved  in a mixed  grazing  situation  or where  creep  grazing  of lambs  is practised
Increasing  weaning  weight  on grass
The challenge  here is to provide  enough,  
weaning.high quality, leafy grass from turn-out  until
Early Grass
The requirements  for producing  early grass, i e, autumn  closing date and spring N 
application,  are well known Late closing  and scarcity  of grass  at lambing  Is a problem  for 
some  farms. To grow early grass  a sheep  pasture  should  be closed  early enough  to have
a dense cover of grass, 4 to 5 cm, in late January/early  February  at the time of N 
application  Grazing  a pasture  bare (2 cm) in late December/January  will obviously  
reduce  grass  growth  in spring  and delay  by about  2 to 3 weeks,  the date when  a desirable  
grass  cover  of 5 to 7 cm at turn-out  is achieved  This in turn has implications  for feeding  
concentrates  to ewes at grass after lambing. No concentrates  are necessary  if sward  
height  is 5 cm or higher,  but may be necessary  when sward height  falls to 3 to 4 cm for 
an extended  period.
Aoril-Mav  period
This should  be the time for achieving  near maximum  growth  rate in lambs  when grass  is 
leafy and highly digestible If set stocking,  the target  should  be to keep sward heights  
close  to 6 cm (range  5 to 7 cm). Tight  grazing  at 4 cm reduced  lamb growth  rate by about  
40 g/day, equivalent  to a loss of almost  3 kg at age 10 weeks However  lax grazing  on 
high grass of 9 cm had little benefit  for lamb growth  but results  in pastures  becoming  
stemmy  in June and needing  topping  (Table  2)
Table 2. Effect of sward height  on lamb growth  (g/day)  to 10 weeks with set 
stocking
Sward  height  (cm)
4 6 9
Lamb growth  rate (g/day) 267 306 315
With paddock  grazing,  the post-grazing  sward height must be considered.  A balance  
must be achieved  between  tight grazing  that prevents  pasture  regrowth  becoming  
stemmy,  and grazing  too tightly, which will reduce  lamb growth. Ideally lambs should  
have access to adequate  leafy grass at all times, especially  as their grass intake  
increases  between  5 and 14 weeks A post grazing  height  of about  4 cm is suggested  at 
this time
Lamb  growth  in June (10 to 14 weeksi
Low lamb growth  rates at this time of year are a major  cause  of low weaning  weight  on 
many farms It may go largely  unnoticed  when lambs  are not being weighed It results  
from the fact that lambs  are becoming  increasingly  dependent  on grazed  grass  at a time 
when pastures  are becoming  stemmy,  especially  if undergrazed  in late May/early  June.  
The challenge  here is to provide  adequate  high quality  grass  for lambs  in this month  pre­
weaning.  Sward  height  and quality  are the key factors  affecting  lamb growth  at this time 
(Table  3). For set stocking,  an increase  in sward height  from, 5 to 6 cm in May to 6 to 7 
cm in June is beneficial.  In paddocks,  an increase  in post-grazing  height  from 4 cm in 
May to about  5 cm in June can be beneficial  where  it avoids  lambs  grazing  stemmy/low  
digestible  herbage  near the base of the sward
Table  3: Effect  of sward  height  and type on lamb growth  rate (g/day)  from 10 to 14 
weeks.

10
Lamb growth  rates of 200 g/day or less are frequently  recorded  during  this time Given  
that a loss In growth  rate of 35 g/day reduces  the potential  weaning  weight  by 1 kg, the 
loss in weaning  weight  can range from about 1 to 3 kg for this month  alone
Maximising  weaning  weight  on grass
Mixed grazing
It is well established  that lamb growth  rate is generally  better with mixed cattle/sheep  
grazing  than with sheep  only and this may add about 2 kg to average  weaning  weight 
(Nolan,  2003).
Creep  orazina
While not widely  practised  on sheep farms, it is an alternative  method  of ensuring  that 
lambs have access  to adequate  grass, ahead of the ewes, from about 7 weeks to 
weaning It helps  to maintain  high lamb growth  rates, and can add over 2 kg to weaning  
weight in a rotational  grazing  system. An additional  advantage  is that ewes may be 
exploited  to graze the paddocks  tightly in the last grazing  cycle pre-weaning  in June,  
resulting  in a more leafy regrowth  for weaned  lambs  (Grennan,  1999).
Lambing  date/weanina  date
This may have an effect  on the weaning  weight  of lambs A lamb born on 1 March  will be 
14 weeks  on 7 June, as against  8 July for a lamb born on 1 April. The early born lamb is 
weaned  before  pastures  become  stemmy  and should  achieve  high growth  rates from 10 
to 14 weeks For the late-born  lamb the month  pre-weaning  corresponds  with June/early  
July when pastures  maybe  stemmy,  resulting  in lower growth  rates. Factors  such as 
availability  of adequate  grass  for the earlier  lambing  date must also be considered
Lamb  growth  on pasture  post weaning
Growth  rate of weaned  lambs  on pasture  can vary greatly,  typically  from 100 to 200 g/day  
Sward height (for set stocking),  post grazing sward height (for rotational  grazing),  
leafiness  of sward and clover  content  are the main factors  affecting  growth  rate The 
leafiness  of the sward will affect the optimum  sward height for set stocking  and post 
grazing  height  for rotational  grazing.  If a stemmy  pasture  is topped  in June  at 6 cm height,  
this layer will have less green leaf in the regrowth  than the layer above  6 cm Therefore 
forcing lambs to graze below 6 cm may result in lambs consuming  herbage  of low 
digestibility  and low growth  rate. The effect of sward height  on growth  rate of weaned  
lambs,  set stocked  on pasture,  is shown  in Table  4.
Table  4. Growth  rate of weaned  lambs  in relation  to sward  height  (set stocking)
Average  sward  height  (cm)
Growth  rate (g/day) 115 141 162
Similarly  pasture  type, and post grazing  sward  height  in a rotational  grazing  system  have 
a significant  effect  on lamb growth  (Table  5) The value  of clover  in improving  lamb growth  
has long been recognised  due to its high digestibility  and high intake by lambs The 
benefit  of clover  will be proportional  to the actual  contribution  of clover  in the diet Growth  
rate on aftergrass  is generally  better  than on pasture  grazed  up to weaning  by sheep  due 
to pasture  quality  and reduced  level of sheep  parasites  on the pasture
11

Grass/clover 117 173 222
In summary,  the maximum  growth  rates expected  on pasture  post weaning  (July-Sept),  
either  set stocked,  or grazed  rotationally,  at appropriate  sward  heights  are: sheep  grazed  
pasture  150 to 170, aftergrass  170 to 190 and grass-clover  swards  180 to 220 g/day  
respectively  This is equivalent  to a range  of about 1 0 to 1.5 kg liveweight  gain per week  
It would  therefore  take from 8 to 12 weeks  to add 12 kg liveweight  to a lamb post weaning  
This may act as a guide  as to which  lambs  would  be expected  to be drafted  by September 
without  creep  feeding.
Creep  feeding  lambs  at pasture
The practice  of creep feeding  spring-born  lambs on pasture  has increased  in recent  
years, as indicated  by the sales of creep  feed, creep  feeders  and the frequent  sighting  of 
creep feeders  in sheep  paddocks  The objective  is to improve  lamb growth,  leading  to 
earlier  drafting,  or higher  carcass  weights  at the same age of drafting In general,  creep  
feeding  will improve  growth  rates, though  the response  to creep  will depend  on both the 
grass  supply  and the level of creep  offered  to lambs
Creep  feeding  ore-weanina
In earlier  studies  at Belclare,  March-born  lambs grazed  rotationally  around  4 paddocks  
from lambing  to weaning.  Paddocks  were grazed  tightly  (to an average  of 4.2 cm) or less 
tightly  (5 1 cm) while some  groups  also had the facility  for lambs  to creep  graze  ahead  of 
ewes Creep  feed was offered  to some groups  at 250 g/day and intake  to weaning  was 
17 kg/lamb The response  to creep, in terms of kg creep required  to give 1 kg extra  
liveweight  is shown  in Table 6.
Table  6. Response  to creep  feeding  pre-weaning
Post grazing  sward  height  (cm)
4.2 5.1
Feed conversion  rate 4 8 6 3
With creep  grazing 113 14.9
The results  showed  that the response  to creep feed varied  with grass supply, ranging  
from about  5 to 6 kg creep  per kg liveweight  with a restricted  grass  supply,  to 11 to 15 kg 
creep  where  lambs  could creep  graze  with no restriction  on grass  supply.
In an intensive  system  of lamb production  over 2 years at Athenry,  lambs also grazed  
around  4 paddocks  with facility  to creep graze The response  to 14 kg creep,  offered  at 
230 g/day  from 5 to 14 weeks,  was small,  with a feed conversion  rate of 12 7 in year one 
In the 2'^'^ year there  was no response  to this rate of creep. Grass  supply  and quality  for
12
lambs  was very high. Lambs  weaned  In early June, were 34.0 kg at 14 weeks  without  
creep, and growth  rates on pasture  from 5 to 14 weeks  were quite good at 303 g/day  
These  results  support  the view that the response  to creep pre-weaning  depends,  in part, 
on grass supply  and quality.
Creep  feeding  weaned  lambs
A number of trials carried out at Belclare  examined  the response  to concentrate  
supplementation  of lambs  on pasture  in the period  July to November.  Concentrates  were  
offered  at rates of 250 to 550 g/day,  or ad-lib.  (1500g/day).  A commercial  product,  at 16% 
crude protein  was generally  used Lambs  were drafted  for slaughter  to determine  the 
response  in terms of feed conversion  rate for carcass  gain. Concentrates  generally  
increased  the liveweight,  carcass  weight  and kill-out % The feed conversion  rates  
achieved  (kg concentrates  per 1 kg carcass  gain) are summarised  in Table 7 They  
generally  ranged  from 7 to 14 kg, with better  feed conversion  rates at the lower rates of 
250g Responses  were lower  at the higher  rates of 400 to 550 g or ad-lib. In some  trials,  
the response  was somewhat  better  where  grass  was scarce  rather  than available  ad-llb.  
At the rates that are likely to be used on farms,  responses  in the range 7 to 10 would be 
expected

Creep-feeding  ore and post weaning
Recent  studies  at Athenry  examined  the response  to creep feeding  lambs  pre and post 
weaning. Ewes and lambs  were set-stocked  on pasture  from turnout  to weaning Two 
stocking  rates, (20 or 24 ewes on 1.5 ha) were used, the lower  stocking  rate to maintain  
sward height  near optimum  at about  6 cm and the higher  stocking  rate to maintain  sward  
height  below  optimum  at about  5 cm. Creep  feed was offered  to lambs,  from age 3 weeks,  
at rates of 0, 300, or 600g/day.  After  weaning  all the lambs  were rotationally  grazed  and 
creep feed was continued  at the same rates as pre-weaning.  Results  in Table 8 show  
average  lamb performance  to weaning  over 4 years

The results  show  that good weaning  weights  can be achieved  without  creep  where  sward  
height is maintained  near optimum Creep feeding  as expected,  increased  weaning  
weights The feed conversion  rate for the lower rate of creep was 6 to 7 at both sward  
heights,  but there was a lower response  to the high rate of creep on the high grass  
allowance.
Results  in Table  9 show the average  lamb performance  to drafting.  Creep  feeding,  in line 
with the higher  weaning  weight  increased  the percentage  of lambs  drafted  at weaning  in 
late June. This figure is important,  as this group is likely to achieve  higher  prices than 
those drafted  later. Average  age of drafting  was reduced  by 4 to 6 weeks  depending  on 
pasture  type and rate of creep  feed used.

Discussion  on finishing  lambs
Given that grazed  grass  costs about  5 cent per kg dry matter  as against  about  25 cents  
per kg of concentrates,  the first priority  is to achieve  high lamb growth  rates pre and post 
weaning  on grass, without  creep feed. Early grass, control  of sward height  and good  
growth  rates in the month  pre-weaning  are key factors  in achieving  high weaning  weight  
Mixed grazing  or creep grazing  can give an added lift to weaning  weight Leafy grass,  
aftergrass  and clover  are the key factors  in achieving  high growth  rate in weaned  lambs
The decision  to creep  feed lambs  may be taken (a) to draft a good proportion  of lambs  in 
June/early  July at prices  higher  than later in the year. Lambing  in early rather  than late
14
March should help in this situation  provided  enough  early grass is available. The 
proportion  of lambs actually  drafted  at the higher  price will largely  decide  the profitability  
of this system Lambs  offered  creep at 300 g/day  will consume  about 20 kg creep pre- 
weaning  (about  25 kg by late July), costing  about  €5 per lamb or €500 for 100 lambs In 
the years 2003/2004  lamb prices  dropped  from about 440 cent at end of May to 400 at 
end June to 360 at end of July, equivalent  to a decrease  of €7.20 and €14 40 per lamb at 
18 kg carcass Assuming  that the creep feed increased  the proportion  drafted  at the 
higher  price, from, say 30 to 70% the cost of the creep at €500 would largely  be spread  
over 40 lambs, costing  about  €12.50  per lamb. Clearly  the proportion  drafted  and price 
achieved  largely  determine  profitability  of creep  feeding
Results  in Table 11 show the average  proportion  of lambs  drafted  at certain  dates on the 
high grass at Athenry. In addition  to earlier  drafting,  lambs receiving  creep were on 
average  about  0.5 kg heavier  carcass  weight,  worth about  €2 per lamb
Table 11. Average  percentage  of lambs  drafted  at varying  dates  at Athenry
DateCreep  feed (g/lamb)
0 300 600

27 July 51.9 83.1 87 1
18 August 58.9 91.3 94.7
7 September 77.6 98 1 98 3
(b) Creep feeding  may also be used to increase  carcass  weight  at the same date of 
drafting At a feed conversion  rate of 10:1 or better  for carcass  gain, this should  leave a 
margin  over cost of concentrate  even at lamb prices  of 360 cent/kg
(c) Lambs  offered  creep at 300 g/day pre and post weaning  were drafted  about  28 days 
earlier than those not receiving  creep (Table 9). They consumed  about 30 kg creep,  
costing  about  €7 50 per lamb. An extra 30 to 40% of these lambs  sold by late July would  
achieve  a higher  price. Earlier  drafting  would save 28 days grazing,  worth about  €2 per 
lamb (provided  the saved  grass  is put to good use). An average  of 1 less dose per lamb 
would be needed  where monthly  dosing  is practised.  (If all farmers  resorted  to creep  
feeding  would the earlier  drafting  pattern  nationally  simply  lead to the lamb price drop 
coming  earlier  in the season?)
(d) At Athenry  Nolan  (2002)  developed  a high output  system  where  the target  was to have 
all lambs  drafted  by early September  at an average  18 kg carcass  weight High quality  
grass, and rotational  grazing  with creep  grazing  of lambs  resulted  in good weaning  weight 
of 34 kg, without  creep  feed After  weaning  lambs  under  36 kg were offered  creep  at 250 
g/day until they reached  this weight  while the lambs  over 36 kg received  no creep This 
resulted  in all lambs  being drafted  by target  date, with an average  concentrate  input of 7 
kg per lamb including  triplets.

Progressing  a World  Class Breeding  Programme

Irish Cattle  Breeding  Federation
Introduction
Irish Cattle Breeding  Federations  (ICBF) stated objective  is to “achieve  the greatest 
possible  genetic  improvement  in the National  cattle herd for the benefit  of Irish farmers,  
the dairy and beef industries  and members ”. Achieving  genetic  improvement  in dairy 
cattle is dependant  on 3 things:
• Access  to accurate  data on animals  to be selected
• A genetic  evaluation  system  that will identify  the most profitable  animals  for breeding
• A breeding  program  that ensures  that the best of these animals  get used widely  
throughout  the cattle breeding  industry.
The current  rate of genetic  gain within  the Irish dairy herd is some  €5,2/year  (milk recorded  
cows only). This is considerably  less than the optimal  gain identified  (€23/cow/year  based  
on 100 bulls tested/yr  or €100 million  by 2015) Looking  at trends  in data recording  and 
progeny  testing  in Ireland  gives  some  insight  into why higher  levels  of genetic  gain are not 
being achieved,  especially  when one considers  it against  other international  countries  
(Table 1) Relative  to Ireland,  these countries  all enjoy much higher  participation  in milk 
recording  (on average  84%), much higher  use of Al (on average  86%), more bulls tested  
(on average  260 bulls tested)  and higher levels of genetic  gain (as evidenced  by the 
improved  milk solids  performance  of dairy animals  in each of the 3 countries)

For Ireland  to compete  with these (and other countries)  on international  dairy markets,  
more focus must be given to the benefits  of cattle breeding.  This paper  is an attempt  to 
summarize  the key features  of a successful  breeding  program,  with particular  reference  
to aspects  of the current  program  that must be improved  if Irish dairy farmers  are to have 
a world class breeding  program
Participation  in data recording
The establishment  of the ICBF cattle breeding  database  (January  2002) has 
revolutionized  the quantity  and quality  of data available  for genetic  evaluations  (Figure  1).

All ICBF member  organizations  (some  30 in total) use the database  for the provision  of 
services  to farmers,  thereby  reducing  data recording  errors  (through  the shared  use of 
Animal  Events  as the ‘single point of entry ’ for cattle breeding  data) and costs of data 
recording  (through  the removal  of duplication  in data entry). To date, some  21% of herds  
and 35% of calves  are involved  in cattle breeding  activities  through  the cattle breeding  
database  Whilst  the introduction  of the ICBF cattle  breeding  database  has brought  about  
dramatic  improvements  in the level of data recording  (e g., the level of recording  of 
calving  performance  data has increased  from 18,183  in 2001 to 345,221  in 2004),  there  
IS still significant  scope  for improvement,  as evidenced  by data contained  in Table 2.

recording  schemes  are hassle  and cost. Achieving  the “target ” levels identified  in Table  
2 will therefore  require major changes  in the way cattle breeding  data is currently  
collected. This must come through better use of technology  and greater
18
integration/synergy  within  the dairy industry.  Examples  include:
Animal  Events  (e g,, calving  performance)  - ways must be examined  of getting  more  
farmers  involved  in the Animal  Events  system.  One of the initial benefits  of Animal  Events  
was that it removed  duplication  in recording  of cattle breeding  data (i.e. between  white  
cards, milk recording  and IHFA birth registration).  Given  the benefits  of Animal  Events  in 
removing  this unnecessary  duplication  (and cost),  the principle  could  be extended  to cover  
other areas of data recording  at farm level, e g. the bovine  herd registrar  and the animal  
remedies  record Expanding  the ICBF database  to support  the collection  of this data (and 
provision  of the required  reports  to farmers)  would  have the desired  effect  of reducing  red- 
tape for farmers  and increasing  the number  of farmers  wishing  to participate  in the Animal  
Events  system.
Insemination  data. Given  the economic  importance  of fertility  at farm level, the recording  
of insemination  data in the ICBF database  (Table  2) is surprisingly  low. This is due to a 
number  of reasons:  (i) duplication  of data recording  between  on-farm  breeding  charts  and 
Animal  Event sheets,  (ii) no incentive  to send insemination  data to ICBF (in the form of 
management  reports),  (iii) errors  in recording  cows ID on Al dockets  (which  accounts  for 
a 40% fall-out  rate in the number  of potential  inseminations  from technician  Al), and (iv) a 
general  decline  in Al in the dairy herd In an attempt  to overcome  these constraints  in Al 
data recording,  ICBF have launched  a number  of new initiatives  with its Al members,  
Teagasc  and vets, aimed  at promoting  the recording  and reporting  of insemination  data at 
farnn level and addressing  the decline  in Al. These  include;
al Breeding  Charts All dairy herds on the cattle breeding  database  (some  8,000 in 
total) received  individual  herd breeding  charts  in Spring  20005  detailing  calving  date,  
ancestry  & EBI for each cow on the farm. The charts  were designed  to promote  easy 
recording  of insemination  data as well as easy return (via free-post  envelopes)  for 
data keying and reporting Breeding  charts are currently  being returned  and 
processed  by ICBF
bl Management  reports A number  of management  reports  have been designed  to 
promote  the return of insemination  data. These include  summary  fertility reports  
(including  infertile  rate), and expected  calving  reports. Further  "real-time ” reports  will 
be launched  in Spring 2006, including  submission  rates, 3-weekly  fertility figures  
action lists.
cl Technician  Al hand-helds ’. These  are currently  being trialed  and will be launched  
Spring  2006 The hand-held ’ will have a number  of features;  (i) all cows on the farm 
will be listed, thereby  eliminating  identification  errors,  (ii) it will carry out an inbreeding  
check against  all proposed  matings,  (iii) it will support  a "mating  plan ” specific  to the 
individual  farm, (iv) it will include  a docket  function  for invoicing  purposes,  and (v) it 
will form an integral  part of a new fertility  management  service  aimed  at increasing  % 
Al in the dairy herd.
dl DIY Insemination  recording  A number  of new developments  are being considered  
including:  (i) SMS text messaging,  (ii) web-site  recording,  and (iii) insemination  
recording  sheets  (to be returned  weekly).
Milk recording  - if the number  of herds  involved  in milk recording  are to be increased,  then 
three major  constraints  must be overcome:  (i) high start-up  costs for the farmer  (through  
purchase  of milk meters),  (ii) insufficient  milk recorders,  (iii) increasing  labor costs at farm
19
level To that end. the introduction  and expansion  of an Electronic  DIY (EDIY)  milk 
recording  service,  across  all parts  of the country  is essential.  The service  operates  on the 
principle  of one recorder  servicing  140 herds  in a given area (20 mile radius)  and moving  
meters  from farm to farm in a 6-8 week cycle. The farmer, using an electronic  data-  
handler  and the milk meters,  captures  all data electronically.  At present,  some 300 herds  
(from a total of 6,600 herds in milk recording)  are involved  in EDIY recording,  with very 
positive  feed-back  reported Farmers  wishing  to avail of this new service  should  speak  
with ICBF, their local co-op  and/or  Teagasc.
Health  data (mastitis/lameness).  The price/cost  squeeze  at farm level will ensure  that in 
the future, cost of production  traits eg., mastitis  and lameness  will become  more  
important  in the EBI Farmers  must have a “trouble-free"  cow if they are to remain  
profitable  To that end, ICBF are currently  examining  options  for the routine  recording  of 
health  data. Options  include;  (i) integrating  animal  remedies  recording  into Animal  Events  
(see above)  (ii) linking with veterinary  systems  (for farmers  involved  in "herd health ” 
systems),  and (iii) use of farm relief  services  (for recording  of data such as lameness).  In 
all case the need for duplication  in data recording  must be removed
Sustainable  systems In the future farmers  will be required  to record  information  on all 
relevant  inputs  and outputs  from the farm (in the form of N, P & K). Much of that data is 
already  contained  in the cattle breeding  database,  e g , animal  inventory,  milk recording,  
beef recording  & slaughter  data With minor  adaptation,  herd-level  information  could be 
recorded  thereby  ensuring:  (i) future farmer  compliance  with EU regulation  (with little 
extra paper-work),  (ii) management  reports on nutrient  efficiency,  (iii) a pro-active  
approach  to sustainable  farming  (as opposed  to a "wait-and-see ” approach,  as with the 
nitrates  directive),  and (iv) an increase  in the number  of herds involved  in the cattle  
breeding  database  as a result.
The foremost  requirement  (and biggest  obstacle)  to genetic  improvement  in dairy cattle  
IS data recording.  To that end, the Irish dairy industry  has a tremendous  strategic  
advantage  over other international  countries,  through  its close relationship  with the 
Department  of Agriculture  and Food (DAF)  for CMMS  & slaughter  data, and integration  
within the cattle breeding  industry.  Nevertheless,  data recording  levels are very low and 
whilst the infra-structure  may now be right to expand  these levels of data recording,  a 
radical  change  in the way data recording  services  are presented  and promoted  must be 
established  if a world class breeding  program  is to be delivered.
Identifying  the most profitable  animals  for breeding
After  data collection,  the second  component  of a genetic  improvement  program  is to have 
an index that identifies  the most profitable  animals  for breeding  The Economic  Breeding  
Index (EBI) was introduced  in January  2001 as a single figure profit index, aimed at 
identifying  bulls and cows that would  leave more overall  profit through  a combination  of 
high profit and good fertility Since its introduction  in 2001. the index has been updated  
twice  to include  information  on new traits (e g , calving  performance)  and latest  economic  
data on the price/cost  ratio at farm level A further  update  is due in November  2005 (EBI 
2006) and will include  new information  on SCC/udder  health A summary  of the traits  
included  in EBI 2006 are given in table 3
20
Table 3. Traits included  in the EBI 2006, including  economic  values  and relative

Carcase  fat score -4 49 1
Udder  Health Udder  Health -55.48 5 5%
As can be seen from Table  3, the most important  traits in the EBI are milk production  (e g 
protein  kg at 25%).  followed  by fertility  (17%  & 14% for Cl and SURV  respectively),  calving  
performance  and beef. Udder  health  (a new trait added  in 2006)  has an overall  weighting  
in the new index of 5%.
The benefits  of EBI are now well acknowledged  at farm level. In simple  terms; EBI = 
profit/I, Based on this principle  and in an attempt  to further  promote  EBI at farm level 
ICBF, Teagasc.  the Farmers  Journal  & ACC bank recently  launched  a new EBI €100 
competition  aimed  at identifying  herds  that were combining  good breeding  & management 
to maximize  profit/I The overall  winner  of the competition  had an average  herd EBI of €67 
and an average  common  profit/l of 20 7 cents/I Based on 220 cows, these figures  
indicate  that, compared  to the average  cow in genetic  evaluations  (born in 1995 and 
milking  in 2000),  these  cows are expected  to leave  on average  (€67 x 2) x 220 = €29,480  
more profit/year  Looking  more closely  at data from within  this herd confirms  the benefits  
of using EBI as a tool on which  to make breeding  decisions.  For example,  the average  
EBI of the top 40 cows on the farm is €100 compared  to the bottom  40 at €34 In overall  
terms  the high EBI cows are expected  to leave (€66 x 2) = € 128/lactation  more profit that 
the bottom  EBI cows. Looking  at the actual performance  of both sets of cows in 2004  
indicates  that on average  the high EBI cows left €176 more profit/lactation,  which is 
consistent  with the expectation  based  on EBI.

The EBI is now well accepted  across  the Irish dairy industry  as the key breeding  tool to 
increase  profit on farms. Nevertheless,  its effectiveness  is somewhat  compromised  by 
the fact that milk co-ops  continue  to purchase  milk on the basis of a flat rate payment  
system  with bonuses  for milk constituents  over a certain  base level. This contrasts  with 
EBI which  values  milk on the basis of total solids  minus  the costs of processing  (which  is 
how milk is sold). This anomaly  further detracts  from a focus on increasing  milk 
solids/cow.  Other improvements  to the EBI will happen  in due course,  e g., lameness  
data and insemination  data as predictors  of Cl & SURV Combined  with other  
developments  in the dairy industry  (e g., milk pricing  developments),  increased  gain can 
be achieved  but will require  all groups  within  the industry  buying  into and supporting  the 
national  breeding  index.
Ensuring  the best animals  are available  through  Al
The final part of any genetic  improvement  program  is to ensure  that the very best animals  
(cows  and young bulls) are available  to the breeding  program.  As noted earlier,  rate of 
genetic  gain within the dairy cow population  is somewhat  less than other international  
countries  and only 25% of what could be achieved  from an optimal  program Such a 
program  if established,  could generate  an extra €100 million  for in 10 years time, with 
cumulative  improvements  of €25 million thereafter  Figure 2 indicates  the rate of gam 
currently  being achieved  in our dairy cow and young  bull populations

Before  the introduction  of the cattle breeding  database,  Al organizations  had limited  
control  over progeny  testing  (in terms  of semen  distribution  and the participation  of herds  
in data recording)  This resulted  in lower reliability  proofs, longer  generation  intervals  
(due to carry-over  of bulls), reduced  genetic gain and increased  costs for Al 
organizations  The launch  of the ICBF cattle-breeding  database  (January  2002),  together  
with the introduction  of the EBI for dairy and beef cattle, presented  ICBF with an 
unprecedented  opportunity  to establish  a new national  progeny  test program  for Irish 
dairy and beef farmers Looking  at trends  from Figure 1 indicates  a marked  increase  in
22
average  EBI of young  bulls for 2004 & 2005. This is a direct consequence  of introduction  
of the Gene Ireland  progeny  test program,  with the average  EBI of bulls involved  in this 
program  in 2004 & 2005 being €80 and €100 respectively.
Gene Ireland is a new progeny  test initiative  involving  ICBF and its member  Al 
organizations.  NCBC  and Dovea  Al. It was launched  in April 2005 and currently  has some  
150 herds contracted.  This program  is distinctly  different  from the previous  programs  
operated  by Al organizations  in that it is “driven"  from the cattle breeding  database  As 
part of the Gene Ireland  program,  ICBF provides  the following  services  to Al participants.
i) Candidate  lists. Al Organizations  are routinely  provided  with lists of potential  
candidate  animals  for progeny  testing,  along with herd-owner  details
ii) Contracting  herds. Using  the cattle breeding  database,  herds  with a suitable  profile  
for progeny  testing  are contracted  (i.e., number  of replacements/year,  commitment 
and data quality)
iii) Setting  minimum  criteria. Only bulls meeting  certain  minimum  criteria  on genetic  
index (e g , average  EBI for Spring  2006 program  = €100) are allowed  entry to the 
program.  This is to safeguard  the interests  of participating  farmers  and to ensure  
genetic  gain is not compromised.
iv) Allocation  of semen To ensure  accurate  and unbiased  proofs,  semen  is allocated  
randomly  to participating  herds  (minimum  10 bulls * 5 straws  = 50 straws  per herd).  
Furthermore,  sufficient  semen  is distributed  to ensure  a minimum  of 100 daughters  
across  100 herds  per bull,
v) Management  of inbreeding.  Farmers  are provided  with in-breeding  checks  for all 
cows in the herd * the progeny  test bulls allocated  to them
vi) Distribution  of semen. Semen  is delivered  to a central  depot by participating  Al 
organizations  and then dispatched  by ICBF to all contracted  herds (includes  both 
DIY and non DIY Al users)
vii) Data collection  Collection  of all relevant  cattle breeding  data is overseen  including  
information  on; (i) insemination  events,  (ii) calving  event,  (iii) beef performance,  (iv) 
milk performance,  and (v) functional  type.
viii) Management  reports. Participants  are provided  with routine  reports  on records/sire  
and “unofficial ” proofs  for participating  bulls.
ix) Ensure  full proofs. Control  over the distribution  of semen  and participation  of the 
herds,  ensures  that ICBF can commit  to giving participants  full proofs  at the end of 
the progeny  test period.
x) Payment  of incentives.  In addition  to administering  the payment  of cash incentives  
on behalf  of herd-owners,  ICBF has committed  to paying  50% of the cash incentive  
(e g., €25/heifer  in 2008),  with the remaining  50% coming  from the Al participants
Whilst  the establishment  of the Gene Ireland  program  has revolutionized  the approach  to 
progeny  testing,  there are still a number  of constraints  to the program,  which are limiting  
its effectiveness.  These  include;
i) Insufficient  bull mothers. Work completed  by ICBF has indicated  that, relative  to 
other countries,  the most profitable  animals  for progeny  testing  are located  on Irish 
dairy farms Nevertheless,  the number  of bull mothers  exceeding  certain  minimum  
standards  as bull mothers  (e g , EBI greater  than €80, functionally  correct & 
registered  in the IHFA herd-book)  is still well below that required  to achieve  100 
bulls tested  per annum. Increasing  the number  of potential  bull mothers  requires  an
23
ii)increase  in the number  of herds involved  in herd-book  activities.  Whilst  this may 
seem  an unnecessary  cost in the eyes of some,  the cost benefits  are obvious  when 
considered  m the context  of increased  sale of breeding  stock (e g , bulls calves  for 
the Gene Ireland  progeny  test program  are currently  making  €1600),
Insufficient  progeny  te$t herds At present  some 150 herds are involved  in the 
progeny  test program On average,  these herds had an average  herd size of 100 
cows and used 60 straws  from 12 bulls on the herd in 2005, Based on these  
figures,  progeny  testing 100 bulls will require  over 800 herds to be involved  in 
progeny  testing.  There  are a number  of major  benefits  to becoming  a Gene Ireland  
progeny  test herds;
Increased  rate of genetic  gain - average  EBI of test bulls for Spring  2006 is €100 
which IS equivalent  to top proven  bulls on the ICBF active bull list The target  for 
2007 will be €120, which is higher  than the rate of increase  for bulls on the active  
bull list (€7/year).
Lncrease  jn number  of potential  bull mothers  - in the future,  progeny  test herds  will 
become  the key source  of genetic  material  for the progeny  test program,  by virtue  
of the fact that they will have the 1 daughters  of the new top bull
Complimentary  $emen  - herds involved  in the program  receive  free semen for 
progeny  test bulls
Cash incentives  - herds involved  in the program  receive  a €50 cash incentive  for 
each progeny  test heifer  in milk recording.
Support  structure  - herds involved  in the program  are supported  in a number  of 
ways above the general  services  available  through  Al, milk recording  and IHFA 
These include  specialized  management  reports  (e g , inbreeding),  benchmarking  
reports  (relative  to other  Gene Ireland  herds)  and improved  data recording  options  
(e g , PAM pilots)
'") Earlier  collection  and delivery  of semen Due to the seasonal  nature of milk 
production  in Ireland,  early collection  and dispatch  of semen  (12 months  of age for 
test bulls), is critical  to avoid unnecessary  lengthening  of the generation  interval  
ICBF and its Al members  are currently  reviewing  strategies  to ensure  more calves  
achieve  semen  delivery  by 12 months.
''') improved  herd health on farms IBR and Johnnes  are 2 infectious  diseases  
prevalent  on Irish dairy farms. Reducing  the incidence  of these  diseases  will have 
the desired  effect  of increasing  selection  intensity  amongst  young  bulls
Summary
In cattle breeding  terms, Ireland Is well positioned  to deliver  a world class breeding  
program It has many  of the vital components:  (i) low cost/high  profit  focus,  (ii) committed  
dairy farmers,  (in) the necessary  infra-structure  to expand  data recording  and (iv) a 
genetic  index that identifies  animal  based on profit. However,  increasing  the level of 
genetic  gam will require  a radical re-appraisal  as to how records  are kept and the 
information  reported  to farmers. Data recording  and reporting  services  must become  
lower  cost and higher  value, if the level of data recording  prevalent  in other countries  is 
to be achieved  in Ireland Improving  the cost/benefits  of data recording  and reporting  
services,  will result in more herds involved  in cattle breeding  activities,  more top bulls 
each year (for Irish farmers  and for export) and increased  profit for farmers  and 
organization  involved  in the Irish dairy industry

Introduction
The Irish dairy Industry  will experience  considerable  change  in the years  to come Among  
the main catalysts  of change,  the reform  of ED agricultural  policy is anticipated  to result  
in a reduction  in dairy product  prices paid to dairy farmers  (Binfield  et al.. 2003) The 
challenge  for Irish dairy farmers  is to increase  the competitiveness  of their businesses  
through increased  scale in the long term but also through  increased  innovation  and 
efficiency  within their current  operations.  One of the main factors  influencing  farm profit  
now and into the future is the genetic  make-up  of the dairy herd, which  will be critical  to 
the profitability  of any dairy enterprise
Until recently,  milk yield has been the main objective  criterion  for selection  in most 
temperate  countries,  and the use of Holstein-Friesian  genetics  of high milk production  
potential  has been widespread.  Overwhelming  evidence  shows  that selection  solely  on 
production  traits results  in reduced  herd health,  fertility  and welfare  (Pryce  and Veerkamp,  
2001, Horan  et al., 2004; Evans  et al.. 2002)  with a reduction  of 1% in calving  rate to first 
service for every 1,000kg increase  in phenotypic  milk yield (Evans et al.. 2005).  
Reproductive  performance  affects  the amount  of milk produced  per cow per day of herd 
life, breeding  costs, rate of voluntary  and involuntary  culling, and the rate of genetic 
progress  for traits of importance  (Plaizier  et al., 1997) and consequently  results in a 
reduction  in the overall  profitability  of a dairy herd (Britt 1985; Dijkhuizen  et al. 1985,  
Lopez-Villalobos  et al.. 2000). In Ireland,  the relative  importance  of fertility is higher  
because  milk production  is based to a large extent on seasonal  pasture  production  
systems  and thus profitability  is influenced  by the ability to calve cows rapidly  at the 
optimum  time
Since 2001, the Economic  Breeding  Index (EBI) has been in effect in Ireland  to identify  
genetically  superior  animals  to increase  profitability  within Irish dairy herds  (Veerkamp  et 
at. 2002) The EBI is currently  composed  of four sub-indexes  (relative  emphasis  in 
parenthesis):  milk production  (49%), fertility/survival  (32%), calving  performance  (8%),  
beef performance  (6%) and health  (5%). The EBI rewards  animals  whose  progeny  have 
a long herd life, annually  producing  a large quantity  of high composition  milk within  a 365- 
day calving  interval,  are easy calving  and have progeny  who themselves  calve easily in 
the future  and exhibit  large carcase  weights  of good conformation
In 2006. approximately  30% of replacements  entering  Irish dairy herds  will have originated  
from Al sires, with the remainder  resulting  from the use of stock bulls (DAFF,  2005). The 
average  EBI of dairy cows and stock bulls recorded  in Ireland  is €24 and €8, respectively,  
with the average  EBI of the dairy cow population  only rising by €1 per annum  (ICBF  
2005). Clearly,  the perceived  importance  of genetics  among  Irish dairy farmers  has been  
eroded in recent years The objective  of the present  paper was *o investigate  the 
influence  of herd EBI on overall  farm profit among  strains  of HF dairy cows differing  in 
genetic  potential  for milk production  and reproductive  performance  across  a variety  of 
pasture-based  production  systems  and to thereby  quantify  the benefit  of using high EBI 
sires on Irish dairy herds
25
Experimental  design
Three strains of HF cows differing  on EBI were compared:  high production  North  
American  (HP), high durability  North American  (HD) and New Zealand  (NZ). The HP 
strain was selected  on the basis of superior  pedigree  index for milk production  with their 
overall  EBI (= €51) derived  exclusively  from their milk production  potential.  The HD strain  
were selected  on the basis of superior  milk production,  fertility  and muscularity  with their 
overall  EBI (= €58) derived  equally  from their milk production  and fertility  potential.  The 
NZ strain was selected  using the highest  possible  genetic  merit within the New Zealand  
genetic  evaluation  system  (Breeding  Worth). The overall  EBI of the NZ group  was €75 
and was evenly  derived  from their milk production  and fertility  potential The EBI and 
component  sub-indices  for each strain is displayed  in Table 1

Each strain was examined  in three pasture-based  production  systems:  high milk output  
per cow from pasture  (MP); high concentrate  feeding  system  at pasture  (HC); and high 
milk output per unit area from pasture  (HS). The MP system  was designed  at 2 47 
cows/ha,  where cows received  300kg of concentrate  fresh weight per cow with the 
remainder  of the milking  cow diet derived  from grazed  grass The HS system  was 
identical  to the MP system  in all respects  except  the stocking  rate on this system  was 2 74 
cows/ha The HC system was identical  to the MP system in all respects  except  
concentrate  supplementation,  with the cows in this system  supplemented  throughout  the 
lactation  at pasture  and in total receiving  1,450kg  of concentrate  fresh weight  per cow. 
The concentrate  supplementation  pattern  for each of the three systems  is shown  in Table

Replacements  were produced  within  the respective  strains.
Production  data results
Milk production  results
The milk production  data for each of the three genetic  groups  on the study from 2001 to 
2004 is shown  in Table 3 below These  milk production  results  are those  achievable  
in a herd scenario  where the age profile and calving  dates of each group are 
identical  and are not influenced  by differences  in reproductive  performance.  As
expected  based  on the differential  in production  potential,  the HP strain had the highest  
total lactation  milk yield, the NZ strain the lowest,  while the HD strain were intermediate  
All three genetic  groups  reacted  differently  to different  feeding  systems.  The reduction  in 
daily milk production  in the HS system  was similar  for both the HD and NZ strains  (0 5 and 
0.6 kg/day,  respectively)  whereas  it was reduced  by 1.2 kg/day  for the HP strain Also 
the milk production  response  to increased  concentrate  supplementation  was greater  for 
both the HP and HD strains  (1.08 kg milk/kg  concentrate  DM for HP: 1.00 kg milk/kg  
concentrate  DM for HD) than the NZ strain (0 43 kg milk/kg  concentrate  for NZ)

The data shows  that both the NZ and HD strains,  selected  for lower  milk production  and 
better  reproductive  traits, had better  reproductive  performance  than a North  American  HF 
strain selected  for high milk production  and that offering  additional  concentrate  to 
animals  of inferior  genetic  potential  for fertility  may not alleviate  the reduced  
reproductive  performance  of such animals  where  adequate  allowances  of high quality  
pasture  are provided.
The influence  of fertility  on animal  productivity
In real terms,  the milk production  differential  between  strains  outlined  in Table 3 will not 
be realised  at farm level as a consequence  of differences  in reproductive  performance.  
As the replacement  rate within a herd increases,  more 1st lactation  animals  will be 
required  to maintain  that herd each year. First and second  lactation  animals  will produce  
only approximately  75 and 90%, respectively  of the milk of a mature cow and 
consequently  higher  replacement  rates result  in a failure  to realise  the production  
potential  of the herd In an actual  farm situation  the HP herd will be younger  (due to 
higher  replacement  rates) and will calve later (due to longer  calving  intervals)  than their 
HD and NZ counterparts  and will therefore  not deliver  on their higher  milk production  
potential The data presented  in Table 5 is the expected  levels of animal  performance  
achievable  In a normal  dairy farm. In such a farm, the average  maturity  of the HP HD 
and NZ strains  would  be 2.6, 3 2 and 4 3 lactations  respectively  and have a mean  calving  
date of March 1, February  19, and February  12, respectively  based  on the differences  in 
reproductive  performance  observed These differences  will result in total lifetime  
performance  of 17,647,  21,202  and 26,530  kg of milk for the HP, HD and NZ strains,  
respectively  (or 1331, 1618 and 2157 kg of milk solids,  respectively).

Economic  Analysis
The Moorepark  Dairy Systems  Model (MDSM)  (Shalloo  et al., 2004), a farm simulation  
model  was used to identify  the effect  of herd EBI on farm profitability.  The model  includes  
animal  inventory  change,  milk production  receipts,  feed costs, land rental charges  and 
labour  costs in the economic  analysis.  All single farm payment  entitlements  have been 
excluded  from the current  analysis.
28
Land area was treated  as an economic  cost with additional  land rented  in when required  
and leased  out when not required  for on-farm  feeding  of animals.  Variable  costs  (fertiliser,  
contractor  charges,  medical  and veterinarian,  artificial  insemination,  siiage, reseeding),  
fixed costs  (machinery  maintenance  and running  costs,  farm maintenance,  car, telephone,  
electricity  and insurance)  and prices (calf, milk, cow) were based on current  prices  
(Teagasc.  2004) The key herd default  parameters  used in the model  farm are shown  in 
Table 6 The EU milk quota  was taken as 468,000  kg with a reference  36 0 g/kg fat The 
corresponding  gross milk price was 22.5 c/kg, assuming  33.0 g/kg protein  with a relative  
price ratio of 1:2 for fat: protein
Replacement  heifer  costs were estimated  at €1,397  (all costs including  land, labour  and 
capital). All male and female calves were assumed  sold at one month of age A 
differential  was placed  between  the strains  in terms  of male calf and cull cow value based  
on the variation  in strain live-weight  The value of male calves  of North American  origin  
was €102, compared  to €64 for the lighter NZ strain calves. All female  calves were  
assumed  sold for €320 (irrespective  of strain) The proportion  of cows removed  from the 
herd in each breed  accounted  for cow deaths  and cows  that failed  to become  pregnant  by 
the end of the breeding  season.

Scenarios  investigated
Three economic  scenarios  were investigated.  In Scenario  1 (SI), it was assumed  that 
farmers  were constrained  by the EU milk quota,  i.e. quota  applied  at farm level Farmers  
with higher  producing  cows  would  reduce  cow numbers  to exactly  meet  quota (evaluation  
based on a fixed output). Surplus  land was leased out. In Scenario  2 (S2). it was 
assumed  that EU milk quota  applied  at an industry  level thereby  allowing  farms  with high 
producing  cows  to maintain  cow numbers  and lease  the additional  quota  required  Where  
quota  leasing  was an option  the lease cost was taken  at 4 3 c/kg of milk Scenario  3 (S3) 
was a no quota  scenario  with higher  producing  cows resulting  in greater  milk income  with 
no additional  quota  costs. Cow numbers  were identical  for all strains  in S2 and S3
Results
In all scenarios  investigated  the milk price shown  for each group  is based  on a projected  
base price of 22 5 c/I (Binfield  et al., 2003), with increases  based on fat and protein  
composition  in excess  of the base level

required  for a 4680001  quota is similar for all strains  (70 cows approx  ) in the MP system,  
thus highlighting  the inadequacy  of milk production  potential  as a measure  of animal  
productivity  in the absence  of good herd fertility With all genetic  groups  and systems  of 
production,  the entire  40-hectare  farm was not required  as quota is the primary  limitation  
to scale of production  in this scenario.
In the MP and HS system,  the NZ strain farm profit was greater  than tnat of the HP and 
HD strains. The differential  in farm profit in both systems  is explained  by differences  in 
the value of milk supplied  (due to milk composition),  stocking  density  achieved  (due to 
animal maintenance  requirements)  and replacement  costs (due to reproductive  perfor­
mance).
Within  the HC system  the highest  profit  was realised  with the HD strain. In the MP system,  
the NZ strain  farm profit  was 613270  and €1042  greater  than with the HP and HD strains,  
respectively,  while in the HC system  the HD strain  farm profit  was €7477  and €3323  higher  
than the HP and NZ strains,  respectively  The results  also show  that with both the HP and 
HD strains,  the farm profit in the HC system  was greater  than that in the MP system,  while  
with the NZ strain the farm profit in the MP system  was greater than in the HC system
Scenario  2. Milk Quota  applied at industry level
The quota-leasing  scenario  allows  farmers  to lease in the additional  quota required  to 
allow  them to supply  the production  of 85 9 cows  of each group  (Table  8). In some  groups  
additional  land will be required  to produce  the quota in order to meet the energy  
requirements  of the herd in that system
Similar  to the SI scenario,  if farmers  are able to lease additional  quota the highest  EBI 
group  will again  achieve  the highest  farm profit in the MP and HS systems.  The HD strain  
will again  deliver the highest  farm profit in the HC system. Importantly,  these results  also 
indicate  that in the MP system  the differential  in farm profit in favour  of the highest  EBI 
strain over both the HD (EBI = €58) and HP (EBI = €51) strains  increases  in a quota  
leasing  scenario.  In the MP system,  the NZ strain farm profit in a quota-leasing  scenario  
was €16526  and €1692  greater  than the HP and HD strains,  respectively  Once  again,  the 
HD strain farm profit was €9951 and €4510 greater  than the HP and NZ strains,  
respectively  in the HC system These  results  once again highlight  the large influence  of 
herd EBI on farm profitability,  and that this influence  becomes  even more critical  when  
quota leasing  is an option.
Scenaho  3. No Quota
The no quota  scenario  allows  farmers  to supply  the production  of 85.9 cows  of each group  
free from the constraints  of quota or the costs of quota leasing  (Table  9). Similar  to the 
S2 scenario,  in the no quota  scenario,  some  groups  will require  additional  land to produce  
the quota in order  to meet the energy  requirements  of the herd in that system.
Similar  to the S2 scenario,  if farmers  are able to produce  milk in the absence  of quota  
restrictions  or quota related  costs, the highest  EBI group  will again achieve  the highest  
fanri profit in the MP and HS systems.  The HD strain will again deliver  the highest  farm 
profit in the HC system. In the MP system,  the higher  EBI NZ strain farm profit in a no 
quota scenario  was €16064  and €1603  greater than the HP and HD strains,  respectively  
Once  again,  the HD strain farm profit was €9242  and €6568  greater  than the HP and NZ 
strains,  respectively  in the HC system.
33
General  Comments:
In the current  analysis,  it is assumed  that all systems  are managed  to the optimum  level 
possible. Optimum  management  of the HC system  requires  that grass utilisation  is 
maintained  at the same  level as the MP and HS system.  Consequently,  in the HC system,  
an increase  In stocking  rate of 11% (above  2,5 LU/ha)  is achieved  to ensure  a high rate 
of utilisation  The higher  stocking  rate required  in the HC system  may or may not be 
permitted  under  the nitrates  directive.  Secondly,  if milk price is below  expectation  
(less than 22.5 c/I), then no marginal  financial  benefit  would  be achieved  through  
concentrate  supplementation.  Such limitations  would  make  a higher  profit  in a HC 
system  impossible  to realise.
Ultimately,  the highest  farm profit observed  in all scenarios  was realised  with the higher  
EBI NZ strain within the low concentrate  MP system. The gain in farm profit with these  
higher  EBI animals  was entirely  consistent  with that expected  based  on the differences  in 
herd EBI, The average  EBI of €75 delivered  an additional  3 c/I and 0,3 c/I of quota  above  
that of the HP (€51) and HD (€58) strains,  respectively  in the MP system  within all milk 
production  scenarios.
The large differential  in profitability  between  the HD and HP strains  from a similar  
overall  EBI demonstrates  the importance  of selecting  for a balance  of all traits of 
economic  significance  (production  and health)  when increasing  the overall  genetic  
potential  of the herd. The profitability  of the HP (EBI = €51) group is far below  
expectation  because  this €51 is derived  entirely  from production  traits and will therefore  
be unrealisable  in the absence  of good herd health.
When the EBI of animals  on the strain comparison  study is compared  to the average  
prevailing  EBI In the national  dairy cow population  (EBI = €24), and based  on the gains  
observed  in the present  study, an increase  in profit of €3500  per 468000  litres (100,000  
gallons)  of quota per year through  the development  of a high EBI herd can be expected  
in the coming  years
Conclusions
The purpose  of this paper  is not to recommend  any given existing  strain of HF for use in 
Irish pasture-based  systems.  This paper  firstly seeks  to demonstrate  the benefit  of EBI 
on total farm profit and the importance  of a robust  breeding  strategy  on dairy farms  in the 
coming  years. On the basis  of the current  analysis,  the marginal  financial  benefit  of using  
high EBI Al sires considerably  outwelghts  the costs or inconvenience  associated  with 
their use Secondly,  the paper  identifies  the critical  genetic  characteristics  desirable  for 
profitable  dairying  within Irish pasture-based  systems In such a system,  profitable  
characteristics  include:
• the capability  to produce  high yields  of good quality  milk from a predominantly  pasture
• diet, based  on a persistent  lactation  profile  without  extreme  peaks  and troughs
• the capability  for good reproduction  and health to: maximise  productivity  by 
maintaining  a pre-dominantly  mature  dairy herd, reduce  the number  of replacement  
animals  that must be reared, calve cows quickly  at the optimum  time, walk long 
distances  and produce  high quality  milk
• the capability  to survive  fluctuations  in feed supply and maintain  adequate  body 
condition  throughout  lactation  on pasture
34
• the capability  to achieve  high grass DM intakes  in order to attain high milk output 
without  depleting  body reserves
• the capability  to survive  in a larger herd, requiring  lower labour  input per kg of milk 
produced
Finally,  this study serves  to illustrate  the magnitude  of genetic  variation  that exists  within  
the Holstein-Friesian  population.  Such large genetic  variation  will permit Irish dairy 
farmers  to make significant  genetic  progress  in the coming  years using an index of total 
economic  merit such as the EBI, From an industry  perspective,  the variability  observed  
in this study highlights  the importance  of an Irish national  progeny-testing  program,  
focused  on the selection  of fertile highly  productive  sires from within  the Irish dairy herd 
Such a program  will add value to the industry  and provide  dairy farmers  with world class  
sires to advance  genetic  improvement  and farm profitability  in the future

Introduction
The dairy industry  is one of the most important  sectors  of Irish agriculture  accounting  for 
31% of Agricultural  output Approximately  27,000 dairy farmers  are involved  in the 
production  of 5.35 million  tonnes  of milk per annum. The dairy processing  industry  has 
become  one of the country's  most important  indigenous  industries  with a turnover  of over 
€2,5 billion in 2001 and employing  over 9,000 people  in related  activities The dairy 
industry  has also made  a significant  contribution  to sustaining  rural communities  over the 
last decade Milk producers  in Ireland  have received  a relatively  high milk price when  
compared  to world market  prices  in recent  years, sustained  through  the application  of a 
milk quota regime  within  the EU as well as other  measures  such as tariffs  on imports  and 
export  refunds,  etc. European  Community  membership  in 1973 provided  Ireland  with a 
degree  of policy stability  as the wider international  political  and economic  climate  was 
reasonably  predictable  in the 1970 ’s, 80’s and 90’s. The purpose  of this paper is to 
highlight  the reality  of dairy farming  over the next 5 to 8 years, and the influence  of such 
factors  as;
• Future  policy  environment  and industry  structure
• Changes  in farm numbers  and milk quota size 
’ Efficiency  gains
• Farm profitability
Future  policy  environment  and industry  structure
WTO
Agricultural  policy  is generated  at global,  EU and national  level There  is strong  pressure  
at global level for a relaxation  of trade-barriers  via the WTO discussions  A compromise 
in these negotiations  has yet to be reached  and despite  the WTO failure  in Cancun,  it is 
possible  that a more fundamental  agreement  on agriculture  trade reform  could yet emerge  
from the Doha Round.
CAP Reform
The Mid-Term  Review  of Agenda  2000 is dictating  the current  policy  environment  for the 
dairy industry A perspective  on the outlook  up to and beyond  2010 is critical  for strategic  
planning  in the immediate  years ahead Movement  towards  a free market seems  
inevitable  and the only question  is how rapidly  this will occur. The strategic  development 
plan for the Irish dairy processing  sector  has recently  been published  (Prospectus  report,  
2003). The FAPRI Ireland  report  has charted  the likely changes  nationally  in relation  to 
farm structure  and income  levels (Breen  and Flennessy,  2003). The Mid Term Review  
(MTR)  was brought  forward  from 2003 to 2002 In the Luxembourg  agreement  on the 
reform of the CAP (Mid Term Review),  Fischler  agreed to the decoupling  of direct  
payments  from agricultural  production  Along  with decoupling,  Fischler  also agreed  to the 
implementation  of a reduction  of the intervention  price for butter and SMP The 
intervention  price for butter  will be reduced  by 25% over five years, resulting  in a 10% 
price cut relative  to Agenda  2000 Butter  prices  will be reduced  by 7% in 2004, 2005 and 
2006 and by 4% in 2007 A 15% cut in the intervention  price for SMP was agreed,  as set
37
out in Agenda  2000 The reduction  is and will take place  from 2004 to 2006, in 5% steps  
Dairy compensation  will be paid from 2004 at a rate of €11.8/t  {1.19c/l)  increasing  to 
€23 65/t (2 42c/l) in 2005 and reaching  the maximum  value of €35 5/t (3.63c/l)  in 2006  
Compensation  is based  on milk production  in the calendar  year 1999/2000  and has been 
decoupled  from production  from 2005 By 2006, entitlements  on dairy farms  will include  
all direct payments  claimed  in the reference  period as well as the decoupled  dairy 
compensation  established  in 2005 The EU Commission  seem to be intent on driving  
down the price of milk paid to dairy farmers  throughout  2004 and 2005
Environment  and animal  wetfare
Compliance  with EU Directives  particularly  on the environment  and food safety  (Nitrogen  
Vulnerable  Zones,  Water  Framework  and Strategic  Environmental  Assessment)  and with 
International  Agreements  (Kyoto Protocol  and Gothenburg  Protocol)  are going to be a 
part of farming  going forward. Farming  systems  need to be sustainable  in terms of the 
environment  and animal  welfare.  Ireland  has a good track record  in this regard,  but needs  
to build on this strength.  Irish cows graze  outdoors  for most of the year and consumers  
perceive  this production  as more 'natural'  and welfare  friendly ’. There needs  to be no 
conflict between  profitable  dairy farming and ecological  sustainability.  Irelands  
comparative  advantage  within  Europe  is grass  based  low cost systems  of milk production  
The potential  for dairy farmers  to secure  higher  prices  for their  output  to compensate  for 
their increasing  costs and downward  pressure  on product  prices  as a result  of policies  at 
EU level to lower  the value  of price and market  support  is limited.  Therefore  it is important  
that we do not erode  the competitiveness  of grass  based  systems  relative  to other high 
input high cost systems  of milk production  through  the introduction  of policies  that may or 
may not have any impact  on the environmental
The EU Nitrates  Directive  (91/676/EEC)  which states that 'the amount  of livestock  
manure  applied  to land each year, including  by the animals  themselves,  shall not exceed  
170 kg organic  N per hectare',  (91/L375/EEC:  7). The implementation  of such legislation  
is likely to reduce  production  efficiency  and potential  profitability  and may lead to higher  
input systems  incorporating  crops such as maize in the dairy diet. The cultivation  of 
maize  requires  the ploughing  of permanent  grassland  containing  very large reserves  of N 
(7 t N /ha approx.)  in the plough  layer  (Gardiner  and Radford,  1980; McGrath  and Zhang,  
2003) This N, which  is otherwise  stable,  becomes  exposed  and therefore  available  when  
the soil is ploughed Whitmore  et al (1992) suggested  that cultivation  of long-term  
grassland  could result  in the release  of up to 500 kg of N/ha in the first year of cultivation  
These  quantities  are beyond  the uptake  capacity  of maize  and hence  lead to substantial  
losses of N to the environment  through volatisation,  denitrification  and leaching.  
Although,  there are few comparisons  of greenhouse  gase emissions  (GFIG)  from grazing  
ruminants  and those fed TMR diets. Van der Nagel et at, (2003) states that total 
greenhouse  gas emissions  from TMR diets were nearly  twice as much as pasture  (1.53  
vs 0 84 kg CO2 equivalent/kg  of milk). Such a shift to higher  input systems  (driven  by 
environmental  policy) may actually  be more damaging  to the environment  than the 
traditional  grass  based  systems  of milk production.  Lovett  et at., (2005)  have shown  that 
increasing  the proportion  of grass  in the diet also has a positive  effect  on GHG emissions.
Farm numbers  and milk quota  size
A more accelerated  exit from dairy farming  than that experienced  in recent years is 
expected  in the future due to the changes  in the coupled  profitability  of dairy farming  
resulting  from the Fischler  reforms. The decoupling  of dairy compensation  makes
38
retirement  or exit from dairy farming  more attractive  as this payment  can be retained  even 
if milk IS no longer  produced.  Lower  margins  are expected  to push farmers  out of the 
industry  while decoupled  dairy compensation  is likely to entice them out As dairy 
compensation  is decoupled  from production  as well as reduced  milk prices  from 2005 it 
IS projected  that a large number  of farmers  will exit or retire from dairy farming sell their 
milk quota and retain their decoupled  payments.  Figure  1 shows  projections  of dairy farm 
numbers  under  a continuation  of Agenda  2000 and also under  the Fischler  reforms

There are approximately  26,500  dairy farmers  in Ireland  at present. If past exit trends  
were to continue,  then about  22,000  dairy farmers  are expect  to remain  by 2012, a 17% 
reduction  on current  numbers The FAPRI-lreland's  farm level research  (Breen and 
Hennessy,  2003) projects  that post decoupling,  farm numbers  will fall more rapidly. It is 
projected  that there will be a 33% reduction  in dairy farm numbers  between  2003 and 
2012 .
All EU member  states have experienced  very significant  structural  changes  in relation  to 
milk production  since the introduction  of milk quotas  in April 1984, Figure 1 shows  the 
change  in milk output per farm from 1983 to 2003 for EU countries  as well as New 
Zealand  and Australia  At the introduction  of the milk quota scheme  in the EU there were  
32,700  and 62,010  milk producing  farms in Denmark  and Ireland  respectively,  while in 
2004 this number  has reduced  to 6,600 (20%)  and 26,500  (43%),  respectively.  Over this 
same period  average  milk quota per farm has increased  from 152,000  and 73,790  kg to 
675,000  and 215,000  kg for Denmark  and Ireland, respectively,  Flowever  this is in 
contrast  to New Zealand  where  the number  of dairy  farmers  has only reduced  from 15.881  
to 12,751,  while nationally  the quantity  of milk processed  has doubled  (6,956  to 14,599  
million litres). In New Zealand  where over the same period dairy cow numbers  have 
increased  from 2,280,273  to 3,851.302  and average  herd size has increased  from 114 to 
302 cows (Lie. 2003)

irish milk production  costs
Table 1 shows the evolution  of costs, receipts  and margins  from 1990 to 2003 for 
specialist  dairy farms in Ireland. The results  show that total costs have increased  on 
average  by 0 15 c/I per year from 1990 to 2003, of which  direct  costs accounted  for 0 05 
c/I and overhead  costs were 0,10 c/I The CSO Agricultural  price Index for total 
agricultural  inputs rose by 13 6% between  1990 and 2002, whereas  total costs for 
specialist  milk production  (Table 1) showed  an increase  of 11.2%. This indicates  a real 
decrease  in unit costs of 2.4% over a twelve-year  period The results  also indicate  that 
overhead  costs increased  at twice the rate of direct  costs, which  are to a large extent  not 
under  the direct  control  of the dairy farmer.

Table 2 shows  the direct costs, overhead  costs and net margin  for the lowest  20% and 
highest  20% of specialist  dairy farmers  in 2002. The cost of production  among  the lowest  
20% was 13 58 c/I, compared  to 23 40 c/I for the highest  20%, a difference  of 9.82c/l  in 
net margin These  results  suggest  that a large proportion  of milk producers  must focus  
much more attention  on achieving  cost efficient  m.lk production  Some  of the difference  
in the costs on specialist  dairy farms  may be due to differences  in soil type and location  
which affects  the quantity  of grazed  grass  In the diet of dairy cows

The Impact  of scale at farm level
The Prospectus  Report  recommends  that changes  to the milk quota system  are required  
to enable milk producers  to grow from (2003) 181,600  litres to 485,780  litres or that 
prevailing  presently  in Denmark  (485,780  litres), Netherlands  (381,360  litres) and 
Northern  Ireland  (349,580  litres). Projections  from FAPRI-Partnership,  The Luxembourg  
CAP Reform  Agreement:  Analysis  of the impact  on EU and Irish Agriculture  (Breen  and 
Hennessy.  2003) showed  that the projected  number  of dairy farmers  in 2012 will be 
18.000  with an average  quota  size of 295,100  litres (65,000  gal). Table  3 shows  the quota  
required  by the specialist  dairy farms to obtain a net farm profit of 640,000  In both 2005  
and 2010 using (NFS)  data for 2003 as shown  in Table 1 Using the average  cost farm 
for 2003 the quota required  to obtain €40,000  net profit increases  from 454,545  litres 
(100,000  gal) in 2005 to 701,754  litres (154,388  gal) in 2010, an increase  of 54%. For the 
20% highest  cost producers,  increasing  milk quota will not be sufficient  to maintain  farm 
profitability,  while for the 20% lowest  costs producers  milk quota would have to increase  
from 303,030  litres (66,667  gal) in 2005 to 396,040  litres (87,130  gal) in 2010 (31%  
increase).  These  increases  are in nominal  terms:  when an inflation  rate of 3% per year is 
considered  the corresponding  increase  required  are 78% for the average  and 47% for the 
lowest  cost producers,  respectively  These  results  suggest  that increases  in quota size 
alone will not maintain  farm profitability  for high cost producers  Therefore  increases  in 
efficiency  as well as scale are essential  at farm level if the dairy enterprise  is to remain  
viable into the future.

Farm profitability
Modelling  specialist  dairy farms  2004 to 2013
The following  is a cost benefit analysis  examining  options  available  to the average  
specialist  Irish dairy farmer  under the Fischler  reforms The average  specialist  dairy  
farmer  in the NFS was used in the analysis:  milk quota of 209,000  kg (46,000  gallons),  
with 44 hectares.  43 cows plus replacements  and various  alternative  enterprises  Within  
this analysis  the SFP is included  in the calculations  of profitability  going forward The 
following  assumptions  were used in the analysis:
(1) The key input variables  used in each of the 10-years  of the analysis  are shown  in 
Table 4
(2) Extra milk quota  to allow  for expansion  was financed  by a 5-year  loan at 4% interest,  
which is available  for restructuring  milk at various  banking  institutions  in Ireland.
(3) Labour  requirement  was based on data from the Moorepark  Labour  Study At a 
herd size of less than 50 cows, labour requirement  was 50.5 hours/cow/year.
41
between  50 and 60 cows 46 1 hours/cow/year  and at a herd size of greater than 60 
cows labour  requirement  of 35 hours/cow/year  The cost of the first labour unit was 
free while any extra requirement  was charged  at €12.40/hour
(4) The book value for the existing  buildings  and machinery  were those for the sixth 
and seventh  year since building  or purchase  respectively.  A 15-year  bank loan at 
7 3% interest  was used to fund the cost of these Investment  in milking  facilities  
was increased  by €3,174  for each additional  7 cows in the herd, financed  by a 15- 
year loan at 7.3% Interest.
(5) Both variable  and fixed costs (excluding  labour)  were increased  on average  by 
1 34% and 2.5% respectively  per year for the 10 years.
(6) All expansion  in cow numbers  was from within the farming  system
(7) Each scenario  was modelled  both for the 25% of lowest  cost producer  and for the 
average  cost producer  The total variable  and fixed costs  for the low cost producers  
and average  cost producers  were 14c/litre  and 17c/litre,  respectively.
A total of five scenarios  were considered  
Scenario  1 static  option
No change  in overall production  between  2004 and 2012. but the farming  system  is 
subjected  to inflation,  reduced  milk price and modulated  direct  payments
Scenario  2 extensive  option
In this scenario  an extensive  system of milk production  is modelled The farmer  
participates  in the Rural Environment  Protection  Scheme  (REPS) Cost of compliance  
with REPS was taken as an increase  of 21% in fixed costs per year (McEvoy,  1999).  
Stocking  rate was reduced  to 1 85 cows/ha,  and N fertiliser  use of 100-kg  N/ha
Scenario  3 50% increase  in milk production  using  conventional  housing  
Cow numbers  are increased  by 50% between  2004 and 2008 This is achieved  by rearing  
65% of female  calves  for replacements  as opposed  to 55% in the static scenario As 
herd size increases  the additional  cows  are housed  in a conventional  type house  at a cost 
of €1591/cow  (Teagasc,  2002), which is financed  by borrowing  over 15-years  at 7 3% 
interest The overall  farm stocking  rate remains  the same
Scenario  4 50% increase  in milk production  using  low cost housing  
This scenario  is similar  to scenario  3 except  that the additional  cows are wintered  on a 
stand-off  pad and an earth bank tank is used to contain  slurry and soiled water This 
system  has a cost of €262/cow,  which is financed  with a 15-year  loan at 7 3% interest
Scenario  5 50% increase  in milk production  with no increase  in housing  costs
In this scenario  it is assumed  that there is adequate  housing  available  for the 50%
increase  in cow numbers
Table 5 shows  the trends in net farm profit (Loss) and net cash flow for the five milk 
production  scenarios  for 2004 to 2013 for low cost producers  In the static  scenario  (SI ) 
the net farm profit and cash flow in 2013 is reduced  in nominal  terms by 4% and 10%, 
respectively  In all three-expansion  scenarios  the farm profit in the first four years is 
lower than either  in the static (SI) or the extensive  scenario  (S2). while in the last five 
years  the expansion  scenarios  are more profitable  With a 100%  expansion,  the cash flow 
trends  in the first four years  are all less than €30 000 In nominal  terms  relative  to SI the 
net farm profit  by 2013 is + 7%, + 14%, + 22% and + 23% for S2. S3 (50%  expansion  with
42
conventional  housing),  S4 (50% expansion  with low cost housing),  S5 (50% expansion  
with no increase  in capital)  respectively  Table 7 shows  the total discounted  farm profit  
and increase  in net worth (livestock  only) for the five scenarios  over the 10 years The 
highest  discounted  farm profit was for the Extensive  50% and 100%  expansion  scenarios  
with no increase  in capital costs (S5/S86)  and was similar  to theor low fixed costs  
scenarios  (S4/S7)  extensive  system  S2. The least profitable  were the 50% expansion  
scenarios  with conventional  housing,  plus SI. However  wWhen  changes  in net worth are 
also considered,  expansion  with either no increase  in capital  cost or with a low capital  
investment  is considerably  merest  profitable The next most profitable  is the extensive 
system  (S2), while remaining  static  (SI) or expansion  with conventional  housing  are least 
profitable,

Trends  in net farm profit (loss)  and net cash flow for the five milk production  scenarios  for 
2004 to 2013 for average  cost producers  are shown  in table 6 In nominal  terms relative  
to SI the net farm profit by 2013 is + 9%, + 6%, + 17%, + 18% for S2, S3, S4 and S5 
respectively.  Compared  to the low cost producers,  S2 is more profitable  than S3 with 
average  cost producers.  Compared  to the low cost farms, the highest  discounted  farm 
profit (Table 7) in the average  cost farms was for the extensive  (S2) system. The least 
profitable  were the 50% expansion  scenarios  with conventional  housing.  When  changes 
in net worth  are also considered,  expansions  with either  no increase  in capital  cost or with 
a low capital  investment  were very similar  to the extensive  system  (S2)
The results  of the modelling  milk production  scenarios  2004 to 2013 indicate:
• For low cost producers  the most financial  rewarding  scenario  was expansion  in milk 
production  with low cost housing  (S6) over the period 2004 to 2013. The least 
profitable  was remaining  static  (SI).
• For average  cost producers  expansion  in milk production  using low cost housing  was 
as profitable  as extensive  systems  (REPS)  over the period  2004 to 2013. The least 
profitable  was remaining  static  or expansion  using conventional  housing
• High rates  of expansion  will only be possible  in low cost systems  using low cost capital  
investment.
• On higher  cost farms increased  efficiency  will be a priority  as expansion  will be very 
difficult  to finance.
• Dairy  farmers  need to consider  their long-term  plans  when  deciding  which  scenario  to 
adopt. An expansion  policy is necessary  for those considering  remaining  in dairy  
farming  into the future.

Conclusion
Continued  reform  of both economic  and environmental  policies  within  the EU will result  in 
increased  pressure  on dairy farm income  through  reduced  product  prices  and increased  
costs of compliance  with EU regulations.  The Nitrates  Directive  is just one of a host of 
environmental  regulations  that will lead to increased  costs at farm level and therefore 
reductions  in the competitiveness  of the Irish grass based systems  of milk production  
The reform  of CAP (Luxembourg  Agreement)  will lead to a reduced  milk price (partially  
compensated  for by the SFP). Dairy farm numbers  have declined  by approximately  3% 
per year since the introduction  of milk quotas. This decline  in numbers  is projected  to 
increase  significantly  under  the Luxembourg  Agreement  but will be dependent  on milk 
price. Given  the projections  for reductions  in milk price, the current  level of restructuring  
is inadequate  to allow dairy farmers  to increase  in scale and therefore  to counteract  the 
price cost squeeze  at farm level. Analysis  of NFS data has shown  that there is large  
variation  in milk production  costs. Dairy farmers  need to increase  efficiency  as well as 
scale to maintain  real incomes  in the decoupled  milk price environment  Analysis  of farm 
profitability  for the average  specialist  dairy farms  in Ireland  has shown  that if they remain  
static over the next 10 years farm income  (including  SFP) will decline  in nominal  terms  
and real terms by 4% and 34%, and 3% and 33% for low cost and average  cost 
producers,  respectively  When  the low and average  cost producers  are compared  over a 
ten-year  period  the low cost producers  earn €65,405  or 21% more profit, indicating  there  
are requirements  for increases  in both scale and efficiency  at farm level

Norwegian  Breeding  Strategy  - Lessons  for Ireland
Torstein  Steine  
Geno, Norway
Introduction
Norway  Is a small country,  and has never been a major contributor  to world animal  
production.  Nevertheless  animal  breeding  has played  an important  role in Norway  for a 
great many years. Norwegian  farmers  have been and are very active in farm animal  
recording,  and consequently  they are also eager to participate  in national  breeding  
schemes.  As a result Norway  has a well established  national  breeding  programme  for 
dairy cattle, beef  cattle,  swine,  sheep  and dairy goats This paper  will focus  on dairy cattle  
breeding
Norwegian  Red
The background  of the Norwegian  Red (the principal  dairy breed in Norway),  is a mixture  
of about  10 old local Norwegian  breeds,  imports  from Sweden  and Finland  in the 40’s, 50s 
and 60s together  with some  earlier  imports  of Ayrshire  and Shorthorn  The creation  of the 
Norwegian  Red started  in 1935 in opposition  to the Authorities ’ idea of keeping  one local 
breed per region  and even per valley. It soon became  obvious  that the bringing  together 
of all potential  good breeds  and making  first a crossbred  population,  a synthetic,  then a 
new breed, was much better  than the existing  programme  Gradually  Norwegian  Red 
spread  all over Norway,  and in 1968 all the old breed  organisations  were amalgamated  to 
form the Norwegian  Red Association,  which is now Geno In Nonway  98% of the cow 
population  is Norwegian  Red, the remaining  2% comprising  cows of the old local breeds,  
Holstein  and Jersey
Discussions,  both centrally  and locally over the period when the Norwegian  Red was 
competing  with other local breeds highlighted  the interest  and importance  of animal  
breeding.  It also illustrated  the effect  of selection.  This debate  may be one of the reasons  
for the high participation  in breeding  work in subsequent  years Over the last decade  
more than 95% of all dairy cows are in the recording  system,  and around  90% are bred 
by Al The result  of this facilitates  an efficient  breeding  programme  even though  the cow 
population  is small.
Breeding  objectives
The interest  in the development  of breeding  traits was reflected  in the interest  amongst  
farmers  to discuss  their own breeding  objectives.  Since  the 70’s when traits like health  
and fertility  were introduced  into the selection  criteria  of Norwegian  Reds, these  changes  
in breeding  criterion  were discussed  and decided  by the farmers.  Therefore  it is correct 
to say that the breeding  objectives  in the Norwegian  Reds is driven by farmers,  though  
geneticists  have taken part in the process  by analysing  alternatives  to illustrate  the effects  
of different  breeding  objectives.
Currently  the existing  breeding  objective  is geared  towards  a low emphasis  on milk yield 
(only 24%), which allows  for greater  weightings  on traits like health  and fertility. Table 1 
shows  the existing  relative  weights  in the Total Merit Index for bulls.

1990 was a very important  year in the development  of the Norwegian  Red breeding  
objectives.  At that time the strategy  of the breeding  programme  was revised,  and a large 
part of that work was devoted  to assessing  breeding  goals With the history  of health  and 
fertility being a part of the selection  decisions  from the mid 70’s, it had already  
demonstrated  that selection  on such low heritability  traits had effect  when based  on large 
progeny  groups. The big question  in 1990 was if the Norwegian  Red breeding  
programme  should  try to copy the big Holstein  programmes  in order  to compete  and avoid  
excessive  semen  imports,  or if the programme  should  continue  along  the same lines with 
more emphasis  on health  and fertility.
Fortunately  the latter alternative  was chosen,  not because  improved  milk yield has no 
value, but because  this gave the Norwegian  Reds a possibility  to improve  their functional  
traits so much that the effects  are easy to document  The consequence  of the choices  
made in 1990 is that the Norwegian  Red today has something  special  to offer the world  
of cattle breeding
Another  speciality  of the Norwegian  Red breeding  objective  is that beef has always  been 
included  as a trait together  with milk yield Norwegian  dairy farmers  have always  
obtained  a significant  part of their income  from producing  beef on animals  coming  from 
the dairy herd. This is still the situation  today. The weighting  on beef in the breeding  
programme  is to obtain  a genetic  change  in growth  rate and also a slight improvement  in 
carcass  grading The intention  however  is not to have Norwegian  Red cows become  like 
Simmental  cows. The goal is to maintain  them as a dairy breed,  but that they should  be 
robust  cows  and heifers,  and young  bulls should  grow fast to give a net income  from beef 
production
Design  of programme
Once breeding  objectives  have been determined  and a recording  system  for the various  
traits put in place,  the possibilities  for testing  and selection  have to be taken into account.  
To obtain  high reliable  proofs  when traits with low heritability  are an important  part of the 
Total Merit Index, the progeny  groups  need to be large. Therefore  the intensive  use of 
test bulls is essential.  For the past 25 years  the guidelines  to the Norwegian  dairy farmers  
have been to use test bulls on 40% of all cows and heifers  in the herd. It is very difficult  
to follow  this up in any way other  than to try and make  farmers  understand  how important  
sufficient  use of test bulls is in a progeny  testing  scheme  which includes  traits like health  
and fertility  with very low heritability
48
In Norway,  such an approach  has worked  out very well. Over the last ten years  the use 
of test bulls has varied  from 37 to 39% in the recording  system. If confined  to Norwegian  
Red the percentage  is slightly  higher
Since 1994 a data programme  has been used to plan matings  in herds This programme  
IS a good tool to obtain  a steady  use of test bulls from herd to herd Herds  in Norway  are 
small, with an average  herd size of 16 full lactation  cows Ten years  ago it was only 13 
Therefore  it is of great  importance  for the quality  of the programme  to have the use of test 
bulls and also elite sires spread  over the entire herd
It IS also important  to use bulls in such a way that inbreeding  will be kept at a low level 
So far this has worked  well. The effective  number  in The Norwegian  Red population  is 
160 animals,  which is quite good, but this is where  it needs  to be if the programme  is to 
succeed  in the future. Today  the system  has changed  from slaughtered  bulls with a large  
number  of stored  semen  doses,  to live bulls where  the elite sires may produce  semen  on 
demand  for the market In this new situation  it is very important  to avoid  too much use of 
some  elite sires, which  may in the long run pose a risk to the entire  breeding  programme.  
It can be expected  that a situation  will arise where  an elite sire is out of service  in Norway,  
but is producing  as much as possible  for the international  market An important  task will 
be to make the Norwegian  farmers  understand  the difference  in how to use outstanding  
sires within a breeding  programme  compared  to a totally commercial  and international  
market.
Environment  - special  breeding  herds  or nucleus  herds
Since the 60’s the cow recording  system  has also been acting as the herd book for 
Norwegian  Reds. In the 60’s and 70's there  was a tendency  to use special  breeding  herds  
or regions,  but this idea has died, and now all herds  in the recording  system  are potential  
breeding  herds The result of this is that the data used in making  selection  decisions 
always  comes  from herds  working  in the environment  where  the selected  animals  will be 
used.
It has often been argued  that feeding  a diet mainly based on roughage  produces  a 
moderate  yield level that reduces  the gain in production  from selection.  This may be true, 
yet Norwegian  Reds seems  to be quite competitive  to other breeds  based  on milk yield 
At low feeding  levels  and with grass  being a large part of the input they seem to do very 
well. Therefore  what is the purpose  of keeping  dairy cows? Answer  - to produce  high 
quality  food from grass and plants  which  are of no use to humans
With such an open programme,  there has never been a market  in Norway  for special  
breeding  animals  besides  selling selected  bull calves  to Geno There has been little 
discussion  on establishing  special  nucleus  herds because  there is nothing  to be gained  
from it compared  with the scheme Further,  little attention  has been paid to embryo  
transfer.  Embryo  transfer  is not used as a tool for producing  bull calves  from selected  bull 
dams. This has been done by purchasing  calves  from the very best cows and heifers  
Herds  are continuous  screened  in the recording  system  to find the best calves With the 
well designed  use of sires across  herds and the use of the mating  plan programme  to 
make the best possible  combinations,  the choice  of very good calves  is not an issue
Future
The most important  task is to maintain  the quality of the Norwegian  Red breeding  
programme,  especially  for traits like health  and fertility With declining  cow numbers  this
49
may become  difficult. It will be possible  to slightly  increase  the use of test bulls, but it is 
more  likely that there  will have to be a reduction  in the size of the progeny  groups Having  
250-300  test daughters  per sire, it is possible  to reduce  this by 50 daughters  per sire and 
still achieve  the results  needed.
With the income  from the export  of semen,  it will be possible  to use some of this money  
to encourage  farmers  to carry out the breeding  programme  in their herd in a more  
effective  manner  than today However,  with Norwegian  Reds being used in other  
countries  either in crossbreeding  or as a pure breed, it should be possible  to include  
information  from other  countries  in the Norwegian  breeding  programme  This means  that 
sufficient  recording  of international  data will contribute  to the expansion  of the base of the 
Norwegian  Red breeding  programme  making  it possible  to continue  the selection  for both 
production  and functional  traits. Such cooperation  will need to be based on contracts,  
and to make  it work as effective  as it should,  test sires have to be used outside  of Norway.
There has always  been, and there continues  to be cooperation  between  the Nordic  Red 
populations  in Sweden,  Finland  and Norway.  This does not contribute  to any expansion  
of the Norwegian  Red population  because  it already  exists. However,  it is very important  
to continue  this programme  in order  not to loose something  that has been gained  to date
Some  important  features  from the Norwegian  Red program
• High participation in recording
• Large use of Al
• Farmers  are very interested  in breeding  work
• Possibility  to use a high percentage  of test bulls
• All recorded  herds  are potential  breeding  herds
• No use of special  nucleus  herds
• Very little ET
• Genetic  gain is well documented
• Systematic  publishing  of information  about  animal  breeding  to educate  farmers

Maximising  Grass  in the Diet of Beef Cattle
Alistair  Black
Teagasc.  Grange  Research  Centre.  Dunsany.  County  Meath
Introduction
Grazed pasture  Is the cheapest  feed source available  to beef producers  m Ireland  
(O’KIely, 1994). However,  the seasonal  patterns  of pasture  production  do not always  
match  animal  requirements  In beef production  systems Pasture  supply  tends  to exceed  
feed demand  in the late spring and early summer  whereas  deficiencies  in feed supply  
occur  in late autumn,  winter  and early spring. The most efficient  beef production  system  
is the one that maximises  the annual  intake  of grazed  pasture  for beef production.  The 
challenge  for beef farmers  Is to utilise a high proportion  of the pasture  produced  while  
simultaneously  achieving  biological  efficiency  and meeting  marketing  requirements.
The objective  of this paper  is to describe  management  strategies  for maximising  pasture  
In the diet of beef cattle in Ireland The strategies  considered  include  altering  feed 
demand  through  stock policy  (e g, stocking  rate, calving  date) and altering  pasture  supply  
through  grazing  management,  nitrogen  (N) fertiliser,  growing  different  plant species  or 
cultivars.  and feeding  supplements
Matching  feed supply  and demand
Maximising  pasture  intake by cattle Is ultimately  achieved  by matching  the seasonal  
patterns  of pasture  production  to animal  requirements  on an annual  basis. The match  
between  feed supply  and demand  is in the first instance  driven  by total annual  dry matter 
(DM) production  and its seasonal  variation The most biologically  efficient  beef farming  
system  is the one in which the maximum  amount  of pasture  produced  is utilised  by the 
animal.
The challenge  facing beef farmers  is achieving  the right combination  of efficient  beef 
production  and marketing  decisions  These  decisions  are not always  complementary  to 
one another Market  demands  for large carcasses,  out-of-season  supply  and product  
uniformity  result in systems  that are poorly  matched  to seasonal  pasture  supply  and are 
therefore  less efficient The most profitable  systems  may be less biologically  efficient,  but 
achieve  livestock  production  targets  that are closely  aligned  with market  requirements  
(Smeaton,  2003),
Stock  policy
The stock policy operated  by beef farmers  rather  than adjustments  to pasture  supply  is 
the key to matching  the seasonal  patterns  of pasture  production  to animal  requirements  
The key features  that influence  the balance  are stocking  rate and calving  date Changing  
stocking  rate moves  the feed requirements  vertically  and changing  calving  date moves  
them horizontally  over time (Matthews  et al., 1999),
Stocking  rate and calving date decisions  provide  a long-term  balance  between  feed 
supply and demand Shorter-term  balance  can be achieved  through stock policy  
decisions  that effectively  manipulate  feed demand  to match year-to-year  variation  in 
seasonal  patterns  of pasture  production.  These  include:
• Animal  performance  targets  (liveweight,  cow condition)
• Weaning  date
51
• Herd culling
• Buying  and selling  of cattle
• The balance  of stock (e g lactating:dry  stock)
Therefore,  although  beef systems  are based on a desired  stock policy reflecting  an 
average  feed profile  and marketing  requirements,  this policy  can be adjusted  to overcome  
short-term  differences  in feed supply  and demand
Stock policy may be adjusted  to maintain  pasture  quality,  which also drives intake per 
animal. On many farms there is a proportion  of cattle that can be used to 'clean up' 
pastures  such as the suckler  cow herd However,  the suckler  cow is often expected  to 
produce  heavier  calves  at weaning This could be difficult  where  she is also expected  to 
consume  poor quality  grasses  in summer  to maintain  pasture  quality  for young  growing  
animals.  Instead,  management  techniques  that prevent  the loss of control  of pasture  (e g. 
topping,  conservation)  become  increasingly  important.
Grazing  management
Grazing  management  strategies  that adjust features  such as average  pasture  cover,  
rotation  length,  and pre- and post-grazing  sward  conditions  can be used to fine-tune  the 
balance  between  feed supply  and demand However,  they cannot  overcome  the year-to-  
year variation  in pasture  supply  and must operate  in conjunction  with realistic  stock  policy  
decisions  (Matthews  et al.. 1999).
Some  principles
Grazing  management  is based  on the control  of sward  conditions  in order  to optimise  net 
herbage  production  (growth  minus  decay)  and utilisation.  The main principles  involved  
are:
• Herbage  production  after grazing  has an early phase  of slow production  reflecting  low 
leaf area and photosynthesis,  a middle  phase of active growth,  and a final phase  
where  herbage  production  slows  due to a rapid increase  in leaf decay
• There  is a broad range  of herbage  mass (approximately  1000-2500  kg DM/ha  above  
ground  for Ireland)  within which net herbage  production  is relatively  unaffected  by 
differences  in herbage  mass This range  is likely to be lower  in the winter  and higher  
in the summer  owing  to changing  environmental  factors,  such as solar radiation
• Grazing  management  decisions  only influence  herbage  production  when  the outcome  
forces  herbage  mass outside  the optimum  range.
• Herbage  intake and cattle performance  are sensitive  to a range of sward  
characteristics,  which can be described  in terms of herbage  mass or sward surface  
height  (Matthews  efa/., 1999).
Therefore,  herbage  mass targets  can be selected  to control  herbage  intake per animal  
(post-grazing),  pasture  quality  (pre-grazing)  and herbage  production  and utilisation  (pre- 
and post-grazing)  This type of information  should  be the basis for grazing  management  
decisions  and is specific  to each stock class.
Subdivision  and grazing  management
Farm subdivision  provides  the basis for controlling  of pasture  production,  quality  and 
utilisation  efficiency.  Recent  advances  in electric  fencing  technology  can enable  high 
levels  of subdivision  to be achieved  at a relatively  low cost.
52
Continuous  stocking  can be used during periods  of rapid pasture  growth to maintain  
pasture  control  because  it maximises  the opportunity  for cattle to consume  all the pasture  
on offer. The key to successful  continuous  stocking  is to select  the appropriate  stocking  
rate that will maintain  a desired  sward  surface  height. For example,  herbage  intake  and 
performance  per bullock  may be expected  to decline  when sward surface  height falls 
below  8-10 cm Sward  conditions  greater  than this will not improve  intake  and will result  
in reduced  grazing  efficiency,  diet quality  and herbage  production.
Rotational  grazing  is based on herbage  allowance  per animal and acts as a rationing  
effect It is an effective  method  of carrying  herbage  mass  from periods  of active  pasture  
growth  to periods  of pasture  shortage However,  if managers  want to maintain  pasture  
quality and cover at high levels in order to maintain  high intake and performance  per 
animal, there is limited scope for using variable  sward targets  to buffer the balance  
between  herbage  growth  and intake  per animal.
Rotational  grazing,  particularly  over the late autumn  and winter  periods,  has given rise to 
a number  of different  grazing  systems,  such as extended  grazing ’, strip grazing',  block  
grazing'  and on/off grazing'. The latter is where cattle are offered  their daily pasture  
allowance  and then moved  from the pasture  to a wintering  pad, for example.  Research  
at Grange  has shown that on/off grazing  reduces  treading  damage  during winter and 
leaves  greater  residuals  to improve  pasture  growth  (Busteed,  1999).
Research  in New Zealand  (Boom and Sheath,  2000) and at Grange  has shown that, 
under  specific  conditions,  rotation  length and herbage  allowance  during  the winter  have 
limited  effects  on final slaughter  weights,  due to the effects  of compensatory  growth In 
general,  decisions  on rotation  length  and herbage  allowance  during  winter  will depend  on 
the balance  of pasture  supply  and demand,  and the element  of risk that is acceptable  with 
regard  to treading  damage  and maintaining  early spring  pasture  covers.
Feed budgets
Feed budgeting  can be used to provide  information  on how available  feed (pasture  and 
supplements)  may best be used to ensure  optimal  levels  of animal  intake  and production.  
Budgets  can be made to determine  the least costly  way of overcoming  a feed deficit  or 
using a surplus After balancing  the budget,  a grazing  plan can be prepared  to ration the 
pasture  to ensure  that planned  intakes  are achieved To make informed  decisions,  
managers  must be able to quantify  the key components  of a feed budget  including  animal  
requirements,  pasture  supply,  expected  pasture  production  and supplements
Nitrogen  fertiliser
Nitrogen  (N) fertiliser  is often the most effective  means  of altering  the seasonal  pattern  of 
pasture  supply  in Ireland  (Ryan  et al-. 1984) Nitrogen  application  is a useful  'supplement' 
for many beef production  systems,  particularly  in the late autumn  and early spring.  
However,  its need must be anticipated  and planned  several  weeks in advance  of its 
application
The magnitude  of the pasture  growth  response  to N fertiliser  depends  on the current  level 
of N deficiency,  the suitability  of climatic  conditions  for pasture  growth,  and the growth  
potential  of the pasture In general.  N fertiliser  responses  on well-managed  pastures  can 
be more that 10 kg DM/kg N applied  during the shoulders ’ of the growing  season  
Responses  can be improved  by applying  fertiliser  when conditions  are suitable  for growth,  
but in reality  feed shortages  usually  occur  when environmental  conditions  for growth  are 
poor
53
The economics  of N responses  will vary with product  prices  and the ability of managers  
to ensure  the extra pasture  produced  Is utilised  profitably  by animals  that will generate  the 
highest  financial  return. This often means  that the extra pasture  produced  should be 
grazed  by suckler  cows or rapidly  growing  animals,  thus maximising  the returns  on the 
money  spent  on fertiliser.
Farmers  can Improve  the N response  efficiency  by using the lowest  rate of N fertiliser 
possible  to meet the feed requirement,  and by allowing  4-6 weeks  of pasture  regrowth  
after N application  Low rates (20-30  kg N/ha)  of N fertiliser  are often more efficient  than 
high rates because  N leaching  and volatilisation  losses  are lower The most efficient  rate 
can be determined  by establishing  small (2 m x 5 m) test plots under  the farm ’s specific  
environmental  conditions,  and is usually  the one which gives the greatest  response  In 
terms of kg DM/kg  N,
Pasture  renewal,  species  and cultivars
Pasture  renewal  {‘reseeding ’) can be a way of altering  seasonal  or total annual  pasture  
production  and Improving  pasture  quality by altering  the botanical  composition  (e g 
Increasing  the legume  content) As a general  rule, priority  for renewal  should  be given  to 
paddocks  that have the greatest  production  potential  that can be realised  with the least 
risk and at the lowest  cost. This often means  that pastures  on fertile,  well drained  soils 
on easy-contoured  land should  be developed  fully before pastures  on lower producing  
land are renewed.
There  are a range  of new ryegrass  and clover  cultivars  with different  seasonal  patterns  of 
production  and nutritive  value that can be considered
Perennial  rveorasses
Perennial  ryegrass  (Lolium  perenne)  Is widely used for Its ease of establishment  and 
management,  adaptability  to a wide range of environments,  and compatibility  with other  
pasture  species. Growth  starts at an air temperature  of 5“C, Is at an optimum  at 18°C,  
and ceases  at 30°C. In Ireland,  this means  that perennial  ryegrass  has a wider  seasonal  
pattern  of production  compared  with most other  grasses,  and growth  Is seldom  limited  by 
high temperatures  In summer.
Perennial  ryegrass  cultivars  vary In their flowering  time In Ireland,  pasture  seed mixes  
tend to be composed  of Intermediate  and late flowering  cultivars. Spring growth Is 
generally  earlier  for earlier  flowering  cultivars  but so is seed-head  emergence,  which  
signals  the start of a decline  In pasture  quality. There  are also a number  of late-flowering  
cultivars  that may provide  an opportunity  to maintain  grazed  pasture  or silage  quality  in 
the late spring  and early summer,  although  some cultivars  may be less suitable  for early 
grazing  (Humphreys  et al-. 2001).
Ryegrass  cultivars  vary in their chromosome  number. This is naturally  diploid for 
perennial  and annual ryegrasses.  By doubling  this, breeders  have created larger  
tetraplold  ryegrasses  with bigger  cells (and larger  seeds)  and a lower dry matter  content,  
Tetraploids  tend to have greater  digestibility  and voluntary  intake  by ruminants,  but may 
require  specific  management  and high fertility to express  any production  advantage  
Their lower  tiller number  and higher  crown,  increase  the risk of over-grazing  that can lead 
to reduced  persistence
54
Italian rvearass
Italian ryegrass  {Lolium  multiflorum)  is an annual,  with an erect growth  form, large leaves  
and few tillers It is sown in autumn  to produce  high quality,  cool-season  feed Some  of 
the diploid  and tetraploid  cultivars  may persist  for 2-3 years  under  ideal conditions  without 
reseeding  The Westerwold  types are true annuals  that do not usually  persist  for more  
than a year  without  reseeding.  Early  spring  production  is a major  advantage  over brassica  
crops such as rape or kale, but regrowth  can be reduced  where  apical  buds are exposed  
to grazing
Hybrid  rveorasses
Hybrid ryegrass  {Lolium  hybridum)  is bred from perennial  ryegrass  and Italian ryegrass.  
Long rotation'  hybrids  contain  a greater  proportion  of perennial  ryegrass  than short  
rotation  hybrids,  but have lower  winter production  They can be used as the sole ryegrass  
component  of a pasture  mix and persistence  is normally  3-5 years.
Short rotation'  hybrid ryegrasses  contain  more Italian ryegrass  in their genetic  make-up  
and consequently,  have higher  winter  production  than ‘long rotation'  hybrid  and perennial  
ryegrasses.  When  sown alone they typically  yield 70-90%  of Italian ryegrass  and persist 
for 3-5 years.
The inclusion  of short rotation'  ryegrasses  in permanent  pasture  mixes adds to the 
ryegrass  competition  challenge  on the slower  establishing  species  such as white clover 
This competition  can be very strong  because  the hybrid  Italian  types have larger  seed so 
establish  faster than perennial  ryegrass  and provide  'early' high quality feed Their 
negative  feature  of suppressing  the slower  establishing  species  compounds  when they 
finally die out, leaving  the residual  pasture  open to the invasion  of undesirable  species.
White clover
White clover  {Trifolium  repens)  and other pasture  legumes  are widely  regarded  for their 
biological  N2-fixing  ability In addition,  most pasture  legumes  are more nutritious  than 
grasses,  and pastures  with a high proportion  of legume  will therefore  enhance  herbage  
intake and animal  performance
In general,  grazing  cattle  will attempt  to select  a diet that is 60-70%  white clover  and 30- 
40% ryegrass. Individual  animal performance  is maximised  when cattle are able to 
consume  this diet However,  such high clover contents  are seldom achieved  in 
conventional  grass/white  clover  swards. High clover  content  may be expected  in young  
pastures  where  the soil N level is low after a cropping  phase. White  clover  then can have  
an advantage  over N-deficient  grasses
Compared  with perennial  ryegrass,  white clover has higher concentrations  of crude  
protein  and digestible  DM, but lower  concentrations  of lignin,  cellulose  and fibre. Because  
white clover  has a high nutritive  value,  and grazing  cattle can achieve  high rates of white  
clover intake,  cattle grazing  white clover  tend to achieve  high liveweight  gains and milk 
yields.
White clover  has a higher  optimum  temperature  for growth  than perennial  ryegrass.  This 
means  that white clover  is most productive  between  late spring and early autumn. The 
decline  in nutritive  value of grasses  in summer,  due to an accumulation  of dead material  
and reproductive  stem, may therefore  be compensated  for by the increased  amount  of 
white clover  in pastures.
55
Supplementary  feeding
This paper  has focussed  on stock policy and agronomic  strategies  that can be used to 
balance  seasonal  variations  in pasture  supply  and feed demand However,  it is important  
to note that supplementary  feeds  are often needed  to alleviate  deficiencies  in the pasture  
supplied There is increasing  interest in the use of complementary  pasture and 
supplement  feeding  strategies  to optimise  the efficient  use of homegrown  forages
Concentrate  or forage  crop supplements  are often used in specialised  beef systems,  but 
emphasis  is usually  placed on the effective  use of conserved  forages  such as grass  
silage For example,  the effective  integration  of silage supplementation  into winter 
grazing  management  systems  can be facilitated  by the use of low cost wintering  pads.
Conclusion
There  are a range  of management  strategies  that can be used to control  the quantity  and 
quality  of pasture  supply,  feed demand  and hence, maximise  annual  pasture  intake for 
beef cattle. Stock  policy  is the key to matching  pasture  supply  and animal  requirements 
Agronomic  strategies  such as grazing  management,  N fertiliser  and growing  different  
pasture  species  should be used to fine-tune  the balance Supplementary  feeds are 
needed  to alleviate  surpluses  and deficiencies  in pasture  supply

Introduction
The objective  of a well-designed  herd health program  is to address  multiple  areas of 
management  in order to reduce  the likelihood  of disease  outbreaks  occurring  in calves  
and adult animals,  and is a necessary  step if economic  returns  are to be realised The 
aim of successful  calf rearing  (suckled  and dairy calves)  is to produce  a healthy  calf which  
is capable  of optimum  performance  throughout  its life from birth through  to finishing.  A 
suitable  calf rearing  system  has the following  characteristics:
Good animal  performance  with minimal  disease  and morbidity  and optimal  growth  rates  
Low cost input  
Low labour  input
The survival  of the calf involves  all of those  factors,  plus a suitable  post-birth  environment, 
management  and nutrition  (Fallon  efa/., 1998) Immunity  against  infectious  diseases  is a 
complex  phenomenon,  involving  interaction  between  different  cell types, each having  
unique function(s).  The immune  response  is classified  into two main categories:  (1) 
humoral  immune  response,  also known  as antibody  mediated  immunity,  passive  immunity 
through  colostrum  and (2) cell-mediated  immunity  B cells produce  the antibodies,  which  
circulate  in the blood
Colostrum
The first and most important  feed given a newborn  dairy calf is colostrum Maternal  
colostrum  provides  the main source of immunoglobulins  (Ig) for the newborn  calf 
Immunoglobulins  help to maintain  the animal ’s health and reduce mortality  rates by 
helping  to eliminate  foreign  organisms  from the body such as bacteria  and viruses. In the 
bovine species,  Ig do not cross the placenta  in utero therefore,  the newborn  calf is 
dependent  on antibodies  obtained  through  ingestion  of colostrum.  Approximately  80% of 
all Ig in colostrum  are of the IgG class  thus, lgG-| plays a critical  role in Ig participation  in 
pathogen  clearance,  IgA comprise  8 to 10% of bovine  colostral  Ig, while IgM make up 5 
to 12%. These  two types provide  immunity  against  systemic  infections
Considerable  variation  exists between  cows with respect  to Ig concentration  in the 
colostrum  A large difference  in colostrum  Ig concentration  exists  between  beef and dairy  
cows (Table  1). High-yielding  cows (Holstein)  produce  more dilute colostrum  resulting  in 
reduced  IgG concentrations  In general  heifers  produce  less colostrum  compared  with 
cows. It is of vital importance  that all calves  are fed 2 litres of colostrum  within  one hour 
of birth and receive  a second  2 litre feed 4 to 6 hours later Thus, Holstein  x Fresian  
calves  should  be assisted  to suckle  or hand fed 4 litres of colostrum  in two feeds  within  6 
hours  of birth as the ability  to absorb  antibodies  decreases  overtime  and is finished  within  
24 hours  of birth The problem  of low serum  antibody  levels  with dairy calves  is increased  
due to the use of high-yielding  cows.

Factors  affecting  calf serum  Ig concentrations  are: 
• Ig concentration  in colostrum,  
colostrum  intake,
Ig mass,
calf age at first feeding,  
nutrition  of the dam,  
method  of ingestion,  
presence  of the dam,  
age of the dam
Studies  at Grange  Research  Centre,  reported  that healthy  calves  had higher  serum Ig 
(lgGi) than calves treated for respiratory  disease  or enteric  disease,  indicating  the 
importance  of high serum  Ig content  to prevent  disease  (Earley  and Fallon,  1999: Earley  
et al., 2000: Earley et al.. 2002). It is well recognised  that Ig are absorbed  from the 
intestine  for only a short period  post birth and that efficiency  of absorption  is dependent  
on ensuring  that the calf receives  adequate  colostrum  in the immediate  post-partum  
period. The ultimate  level of serum  Ig achieved  by the calf will depend  on the total mass  
of Ig absorbed,  which is a function  of the Ig concentration  of colostrum  and the total 
amount  of colostrum  ingested  during the period of maximum  absorption.  By feeding  
adequate  quantities  of colostrum  to the calf immediately  following  birth and during  the first 
24h post birth, the incidence  of E. coll septicaemia  should  be diminished.  Colostrum  
feeding  should  continue  as long as possible  after birth. While Ig are not absorbed  after 
24 hours  they continue  to provide  local protection  in the intestinal  tract.
Calf mortality
Calf mortality  can best be subdivided  into 4 main categories:
• Abortions  (foetal  loss at less than or equal to 270 days gestation)
• Perinatal  mortality  (foetal  loss at greater  than 270 days gestation  and mortality  during  
the first 24 hours  of life)
• Neonatal  mortality  (calves  born alive that die between  24h and 28 days).
• Older  calf mortality  (calves  born alive that die between  29 and 84 days)
Morbidity  and mortality  of the young  calf represent  a major  cause of economic  concern  
for beef producers.  Septicaemia  and enteric  disorders  (scours)  caused  by strains  of 
Escherichia  coll, Rotavirus,  Neospora,  Coronavirus,  Cryptosporidium  or by Salmonella  
species  are the main cause  of neonatal  mortality.  Older  calf mortality  is mainly  dominated  
by respiratory  infections  and salmonellosis.  Disease  is not a simple  matter  of exposure  
of a susceptible  animal to an infectious  agent such as a bacterium,  virus or fungus.  
Calves are exposed  to infectious  organisms  from the moment  of birth, and natural  
defence  mechanisms  usually  prevent  the establishment  of disease Animals  develop  
disease  because  of a complex  relationship  between  the host (animal),  the infectious
68
agent (bacterium,  virus, fungus,  or toxic agent),  and the environment  Control  is largely
based  on prevention  of exposure  and immunity.
A disease  prevention  programme  in the young  calf should  include:
• A clean calving  area, which  prevents  the build up of infection Clean  and disinfect  the 
calving  box after each calving.
• Have a policy  in place  that ensures that the calf has an opportunity  to obtain  adequate  
quantities  of colostrum  as soon as possible  after birth
• If Johne's  disease  is a problem  or potential  problem  - separate  all suspect  cows from 
the rest of the herd and keep all female calves away from suspect  cows at and 
following  calving.
• Post calving:  provide  suckler  calves with a clean environment  either indoors  or 
outdoors  that minimises  disease  build up Do not add newborn  calves  to an indoor  
environment  that has been or is being used to house  older  calves
• Rear calves  outdoors  where  practical.
• Health check - daily or ideally  twice a day health checks  should  be undertaken  to 
determine  if animals  are ill. If an illness  is suspected  in an animal,  one should  observe  
the animal ’s body temperature,  breathing  and heart rate. If an abnormality  is 
suspected  in the vital functions,  suspect  an underlying  illness  and be prepared  to call 
for veterinary  help
Use the following  as a general  guide  in a health  check

Calf diarrhoea:
Outbreaks  of diarrhoea  in calves are associated  with the interaction  of potentially  
pathogenic  enteric microorganisms  with the calfs immunity,  nutritional  state and 
environment.  An outbreak  may be triggered  by a single  infectious  agent  but is mainly  due 
to mixed infections. The most common  organisms  involved  are Escherichia  coil., 
Saimoneiia  species.  Rotavirus,  Coronavirus  and Cryptosporidium.  Dehydration,  acidosis,  
impaired  growth  rate or death are the major  consequences.
Escherichia  coti infections  (cotibacittosis):  To be enteropathogenic,  E. coti strains  must be 
able to adhere  to the small intestine.  The K99 antigens  allow  adherence  of the organisms 
to the mucosal  wall £. coii then produces  an enterotoxin  that causes  excess  secretion  of 
fluid into the intestinal  wall resulting  in diarrhoea.  Loss of body fluids in this way leads  to 
dehydration.  In animals  deprived  of colostrum,  in particular  the Ig subclass  IgM, a rapidly  
developing  shock-like  syndrome  (circulatory  failure)  occurs  which  results  in sudden  death
Saimonettosis:  Salmonellosis  in calves is mainly  caused  by the organisms  Saimoneiia  
dubiin  or Saimoneiia  typhimurium.  Saimoneiia  typhimurium  DTI 04 is highly pathogenic
59
to calves,  resulting  in a high incidence  of mortality Furthermore,  it has a wide range of 
antibiotic  resistance  and is capable  of rapidly  developing  new resistance  patterns It is 
also an important  cause  of human  food poisoning  In acute cases  of calf salmonellosis,  
a septicaemia  may occur, accompanied  by blood stained  diarrhoea Calves  that are 
affected  more severely  have an elevated  body temperature  (greater  than 40°C) are 
debilitated  and have reduced  feed intake The calf may become  infected  as early as the 
second  day of life with highest  incidences  occurring  at 1 to 5 weeks  of age Outbreaks  
of Salmonella  typhimurium  are usually  associated  with purchased  calves. Salmonellosis 
superimposed  on calves  with pre-existing  pneumonia,  cause  an exacerbation  of clinical  
signs and pulmonary  damage.
A number  of preventative  measures  have been adopted  to control  calf diarrhoea
• Vaccination  of the dam against  £. coll infection.
• Hyper-immunisation  of the dam with the £ coli antigen  provides  passive  immunity  to 
the calf (via ingested  colostrum)  during  the first 2 to 3 weeks  of life, i e. before  it can 
produce  its own antibodies.
• It is of vital importance  that all calves  are fed 2 litres of colostrum  within one hour of 
birth and receive  a second  2 litre feed 4 to 6 hours  later. There  is no merit  from having  
enhanced  quality  colostrum  from vaccination  of the cow unless  that colostrum  is fed 
to and ingested  by the calf.
• If salmonellosis  is a problem  on the farm then ensure  a policy of vaccination  of the 
calves. Similarly  when purchasing  calves, employ  a programme  of refusing  to 
purchase  any ill calves and vaccinating  all calves  on arrival using an appropriate  
vaccine  against  salmonella.
• Have your veterinary  practitioner  identify  the causal  organism  causing  the diarrhoea  
so that the most appropriate  antibiotic  treatment  can be employed.
• A calf with diarrhoea  will have a significant  loss in body fluid so oral rehydration  with 
an electrolyte  solution  should  be immediately  used to assist  recovery.
Calf pneumonia
The underlying  cause  of bovine  respiratory  disease  (BRD)  is extremely  complex  with the 
involvement  of viruses,  bacteria  and Mycoplasma  The incidence  of infection  (morbidity)  
is usually  high, but the mortality  rate is variable.  Predisposing  factors  affecting  ability  to 
fight infection  are stress, overcrowding,  inadequate  ventilation,  draughts,  fluctuating  
temperatures,  poor nutrition  and/or  concurrent  disease. In most cases it would appear  
that the primary  infective  agent is viral, producing  respiratory  tract damage  that is 
subsequently  extended  by Mycoplasmas  and secondary  bacterial  infections  Viruses  are 
unaffected  by antibiotics,  however,  antibiotic  treatment  is usually  administered  to kill off 
secondary  bacterial  infections  and offer the calf the opportunity  to fight the disease  
Mycoplasma  species  are resistant  to antibiotics  that act on the cell wall and an antibiotic  
specific  to the cell nucleus  is required  to inactivate  it. In order  to direct the appropriate  
treatment  strategy,  nasal swabs should be submitted  to the Regional  Veterinary  
Laboratory  for accurate  identification  of the pathogen(s)  involved. In addition,  
Mycoplasmas  are known to suppress  the calfs immunity  to disease. Of the 
mycoplasmas.  M. bovis is the most pathogenic  and can act in unison  with Pasteurella  
species  to produce  a very severe  form of pneumonia  Following  suppression  of immunity  
the animal's  ability to withstand  an attack from Pasteurella  and other organisms  is 
reduced Pasteurella  haemolytica  is an important  secondary  agent  in respiratory  disease
60
Vaccination  against  Respiratory  Disease
Numerous  vaccines  provide  a range  of combinations  of live and/or killed antigens.  These  
include  IBR, RSV and PI-3 Pasteurella  spp. and Haemophilus  somnus Intramuscular 
modified-live  virus vaccines  quickly  induce  long-lasting  immunity  Intranasal  modified-live  
virus vaccines  induce  immunity  at the mucosal  surface However,  experience  at Grange  
has shown  that response  to these  vaccines  were only evident  in calves  over two months  
of age when their own immune  system  was active. It is difficult to successfully  vaccinate  
young calves  against  these diseases  because  protective  colostral  antibodies  block the 
vaccine,  resulting  in maternal  antibody  interference  of vaccination  The Pasteurella  
organisms  and other bacteria  that cause pneumonia  are notoriously  poor immunizers 
Development  of effective  vaccines  has been difficult. High serum Ig concentrations  in 
young calves  have a positive  effect  on reducing  the incidence  of respiratory  disease A 
study at Grange  on purchased  Friesian  calves found that the incidence  of respiratory  
disease  and enteric  disease  and the requirement  for frequent  treatments  was lower in 
dairy calves  with a higher  Ig concentration  (Earley  et al., 2000).
Respiratory  disease  prevention  should  include :
Housing  with good ventilation  and adequate  space  allowance.  
Avoid mixing  old and young  calves.
Purchase  calves  in batches  and operate  an “all in - all out” policy  
Clean  disinfect  and rest houses  between  batches.
Avoid  wet lying conditions  and provide  the young  calf with shelter
Animal  Welfare  Research
Research  at Grange  has focused  on 4 main husbandry  management  practices,  namely,  
castration,  weaning,  housing  and transportation.  The main findings  are summarised  as 
follows:
Castration
Castration  is performed  on calves  because  it reduces  management  problems  associated 
with aggressive  and sexual behaviour  of bulls. The main castration  techniques  used 
include  rubber  rings or latex bands  (to restrict  flow of blood  to the scrotum),  the bloodless 
burdizzo  method  (crushes  spermatic  cords)  and surgery.
Burdizzo  castration
Based on the principle  that crushing  destroys  the spermatic  cord carrying  blood to the 
testicles,  which  subsequently  atrophy  but that the skin of the scrotum  remains  intact and 
because  of the lack of open wounds  the potential  for haemorrhage  or infection  is 
minimised.  A Burdizzo  or clamp  is used to crush  the spermatic  cord, but the blood supply  
to the scrotum  remains  preserved.  Each spermatic  cord is crushed  twice (second  crush  
below  the first) for 10 s each along the neck of the scrotum  with the Burdizzo  to ensure 
completeness  of the castration  procedure.
Banding  castration
This procedure  involves  the application  of a specially  designed  elastic  band with the aid 
of an applicator  around  the neck of the scrotum,  proximal  to the testicles This will cause  
necrosis  of the testicles,  eventually  leading  to testicular  atrophy  and sloughing  of the 
scrotum Small rubber  rings are used for calves  less than one month  of age (rubber  ring 
castration),  while for older  calves,  heavy-wall  latex bands  are used along  with a grommet
61
to securely  fasten  the tubing  at the appropriate  tension. Tetanus  has been reported  in 
banded  animals  therefore  animals  should  receive  a tetanus  prophylaxis  to minimise  the 
risk
Surgical  castration
This is a surgical  procedure  involving  the opening  of the scrotum  with a sharp  blade and 
removal  of the testicles  by severing  them from the spermatic  cords. This is the most 
reliable  method  of castration.  Asceptic  conditions  are vital and post-castration  attention  
is necessary  to ensure the prevention  of bleeding  and infection. A study in 2005 
compared  burdizzo  and banding  castration  using 12 month  old bulls, the results  showed  
that there were no significant  differences  in the performance  of animals  that were 
castrated  using either  burdizzo  or banding  castration  (Table  2).
A series  of recent  castration  studies  found that;
Surgical  castration  induced a greater stress response  than bloodless  “Burdizzo ” 
castration
Calves at 47 days of age exhibited  lower stress responses  (plasma  cortisol and 
inflammatory  responses)  to burdizzo  castration  than older  calves  (76 to 165 days of age). 
Systemic  analgesia  with a non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug (ketoprofen)  was more  
effective  than local or epidural  anesthesia  in lowering  stress levels (Earley  and Crowe,  
2002 )
The pain-associated  behavioural  responses  were similar  following  either burdizzo  or 
surgical  castration.

Weaning
Weaning  of the suckled  calf from its dam can be particularly  stressful  for the calf and may 
be compounded  by several  other stressors,  e g change  of diet (grass and milk to 
conserved  feed with or without  concentrates),  change  of environment  (outdoors  to 
indoors),  transport/marketing,  de-horning  and castration As with the young calf the 
underlying  cause of bovine respiratory  disease  (BRD) in weaned  calves is extremely  
complex  with the involvement  of viruses,  bacteria  and mycoplasma.  In most cases it 
would  appear  that the primary  infective  agent  is viral, producing  respiratory  tract damage  
that is subsequently  extended  by Mycoplasmas,  and secondary  bacterial  infections,  
Pasteurella  Predisposing  factors  affecting  the calf's ability  to fight infection  are stress,  
overcrowding,  inadequate  ventilation,  draughts,  fluctuating  temperatures,  poor nutrition  
and/or concurrent  disease Suckled calves that have been eating 1 kg of
62
concentrates/day  in the 5-6 week period before  weaning  are less stressed  at weaning  
than calves  that have not been introduced  to meals Veterinary  advice  should  be sought  
for a suitable  vaccination  programme  and the widest  protection  will be achieved  where  the 
programme  includes  Pasteurella  and the two most common  respiratory  viruses,  RSV and 
PI-3. Hickey  etal. (2003a)  examining  the effect  of combined  psychological  and nutritional  
stress of maternal  separation  concluded  that farm management  practices  at weaning  
should  aim to minimise  the social distress  of calves  during  this time and allow calves  a 
period  of adaptation  before  other management  stresses  are imposed.
• Abrupt  weaning  should  be avoided
• Stress  following  weaning  will be reduced  if calves  are consuming  1 kg of creep feed 
daily prior to weaning.
• Keep the herd in a properly  fenced  field with a good grass supply  or with silage (or 
hay) supplementation  and remove  the cows gradually  (up to one-quarter  on any one 
occasion)  to a location  away  from the calves. During  this period  the concentrate  creep  
can be increased  gradually  to about 1 kg per calf daily.
• If cows and calves  are housed  together  after weaning,  then they should  be housed  in 
adjoining  pens  with calves  having  access  to the cows  for up to two weeks  while  getting  
accustomed  to their new diets. Concentrates  should  be introduced  gradually  to the 
calves  at this time if they have not been previously  creep  fed
• Dehorning  or castration  should  not be carried  out in the four-week  period before  or 
after weaning.
• Similarly,  immediate  sale and transport  will lead to undue  stress,  which  could give rise 
to respiratory  problems.
Transportation
The transport  of livestock  can have major  implications  for their  welfare,  and there is strong  
public  interest  and scientific  endeavour  aimed  at ensuring  that the welfare  of transported  
animals  is optimal. Teagasc,  conducted  a series of scientific  studies  to evaluate  the 
effects  of 1). transport  by land and sea journeys  (roll-on  roll-off),  and 2). stocking  density,  
on the welfare  of cattle  transported  within Ireland,  from Ireland  to Spain  and from Ireland  
to Italy under  conditions  outlined  in Directive  91/628/EEC.
• Transport  from Ireland  to Spain and Ireland  to Italy had no adverse  effect on animal  
welfare  based  on physiological,  haematological  and immunological  measurements.
• There  was no welfare  advantage  in transporting  young  bulls (230 kg) at 1.27m2  versus  
the standard  stocking  density  of 0 85m2 on a 12-hour  road journey. Within the 
conditions  of the transport  studies,  and based on the physiological,  haematological  
and immunological  measurements  that were made  in assessing  the welfare  of control  
and transported  animals,  transport  had no adverse  effect  on animal  welfare  (Earley  et 
al., 2005a;  Earley  et al.. 2005b).
• There  was no significant  effect  on rectal  body  temperature,  pre and post transport  and 
in live weight  among  treatments  on days 0 (pre-transport),  1,4 and 10 (post-transport) 
on animals  fasted or not fasted  for 8 hours prior to an 8-hour  road journey  and their 
ability  to cope with the stress  of transport
• Animals  that were fasted  and then transported  lost 9.4% bodyweight  following  the 8- 
hour journey,  while non-fasted  and transported  animals  lost 7.2%. The control  
animals  remaining  at grass  and non-fasted  gained  2%.
63
It was concluded  that, there  was no evidence  to suggest,  under  the conditions  applicable  
to the transport  studies,  that transport  adversely  affected  the performance  of animals  
post-transport.
Housing
The welfare  status  of an animal  is dependent  on its ability  to cope and exist in harmony  
with Its environment,  such that good physical  and psychological  health is maintained.  
Unlike other farm production  systems  (poultry,  pigs and housed  calves)  a European  
legislative  directive  on the welfare  of housed finishing  cattle during housing  is still 
outstanding.  In many Irish beef production  systems,  animals  are generally  housed  in a 
concrete  slatted-floor  shed for a 4-5 month winter  period at a stocking  density  of 2 2 
m^/head  for 500 kg animal  (Dodd, 1985) and generally  fed ad libitum  grass silage  with 
concentrate  supplementation.  High stocking  densities  of less than 2 Om^/head  have 
been shown  to adversely  affect animal  performance  and the frequency  and duration  of 
lying and levels  of aggression  within  groups
A series of studies  from Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  can be summarised  as 
follows:
• Fisher  et al. (1997)  examined  the effect of space allowance  (1,5, 2,0, 2.5 and 3.0 
m2/head)  on the welfare  of finishing  heifers  housed  for a three month  period  on slats.  
They found  that there  was no effect  of treatment  on the measured  immune  response,
• However  the animals  at the 1.5 m^/head  had a lower ADG Hickey  et al. (2003b)  
found that a space allowance  (1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 4 0 m2) below 3 0 m2 significantly  
reduced  both feed intake and ADG (Table 3). However,  irrespective  of treatment,  
animal  social  and stereotypic  behaviour  was found  to continually  alter with extending  
housing  duration  (Hickey  et al.. 2003b)  and restricted  spatial allowances  in slatted  
floor facilities  may present  a challenge  to the animal ’s ability to cope with housing  
stress. The measured  welfare  indices  of animals  housed  on slats at 4 m2/head  did 
not differ  from those  of animals  housed  on straw,  with the exception  that the daily time 
spent  lying increased  from 12.3 to 13 5 h for the straw  bedded  animals
• The housing  of finishing  bulls at a reduced  space  allowance  of 1.2 m2 (vs 2 7 and 4 2 
m2) (Figure  1) significantly  reduced  animal  growth  without  causing  substantial  effects  
on immune  function  (Gupta  et al., 2005),
• Long distance  transport  of weanlings  under  current  EU legislation  does not adversely  
affect  the performance  of animals  post-transport.
• Mixing of weanlings  during housing  from different  sources  is likely to cause BRD 
when compounded  with other  stressors

Conclusion
Within any health management  programme  it Is important  to provide  routine,  planned  
procedures  that will prevent  or minimize  disease.
• Reduce  the risks of disease  in the young  calf by reducing  the level of exposure  and 
using natural  colostrum  antibodies  for protection
• Vaccinations  help reduce  the probability  of disease  but cannot  solely be depended  
upon for prevention  therefore,  use where  appropriate  to protect  against  disease
65
• Reduce  stress at weaning  through  a planned  approach  to avoid multiple  stressors  
acting in unison
• Young  animals  are less stressed  by castration  compared  to older animals,
• Banding  castration  is a viable  alternative  to Burdizzo  castration.
• During the housing  period, animals  should have adequate  space allowance  to 
facilitate  ease of movement  and avoid overcrowding  which impacts  negatively  on 
animal  performance  and welfare

Efficient  and Profitable  Production  of Quality  Beef
Tim Keady

Introduction
Beef production  is currently  in the process  of transition  from an environment  in which  
decisions  were often subsidy-driven  to a market-driven,  subsidy-free  system To achieve  
positive  net margins  from beef production,  producers  will need to improve  efficiency  of 
productivity,  whilst  at the same  time a significant  increase  in market  value  will be required  
for quality product In 2004 the total subsidy  received  by beef cattle equated  to the 
equivalent  of approximately  €1.60/kg  of carcass  beef produced Currently  greater  than 
55% of beef producers  are part-time  and it is projected  that this figure will increase  
dramatically  in the future.
To remain  profitable  in beef production,  producers  will need to increase  output  per labour  
unit, improve  efficiency  and obtain  a higher  return  from the market  place  to offset  the loss 
of €1,60/kg carcass  in subsidy  foregone.  The aim of the current  paper is to highlight  
potential  savings  that can be made  in the costs  of beef production,  based  on experimental 
data from recent  studies  undertaken  by the Beef Unit at the Agricultural  Research  Institute  
of Northern  Ireland  (ARINI) Where  financial  data are presented  an exchange  rate of 
£0,70  per €1 is assumed.
Improving  genetics  of the suckler  herd
Recent  research  on 43 commercial  beef farms across Northern  Ireland  (Keady  et al . 
2004b)  evaluated  the effects of 10 of the most common  suckler  cow genotypes  on 
progeny  carcass  characteristics  and subsequent  reappearance  rate Results are 
presented  in Table 1 Choice  of suckler  cow genotype  can alter progeny  carcass  value  by 
up to €47/head  and reappearance  rate at day 390 (number  of cows  producing  another  calf 
within 390 days)  by 10 percentage  units

It should be noted that cows consisting  of 50% of 2 breeds, e g Limousin  x 
Holstein/Friesian,  had better  fertility  than cows comprising  predominantly  of one breed,  
e g Angus,  probably  due to hybrid  vigour  effects Consequently  whilst  there is potential  
between  the worst and best cow genotypes  to increase  progeny  carcass  value by up to 
€47/head,  realistically  on most farms, when progeny  carcass  value and fertility are 
considered,  the potential  is approximately  €28/head,  which is equivalent  to 8 c/kg 
carcass.
Terminal  sire
The effect of choice  of terminal  sire breed was evaluated  on 43 commercial  beef farms  
across  Northern  Ireland  (Kirkland  et al., 2004a)  and results  are presented  in Table 2 
Choice  of terminal  sire breed can alter progeny  carcass  value (using current  payment  
schemes  in Northern  Ireland)  by up to €89/head  and subsequent  cow reappearance  rate 
by 13 percentage  units. Furthermore  choice  of terminal  sire can have a major  influence  
on herd output  due to potential  impacts  on calving  difficulty  and subsequent  cow fertility

(Kirkland  et al.. 2004a)
The results  indicate  that the Charolais  and Blonde  breeds  produced  high value  carcasses  
without  adverse  effects  on subsequent  fertility  (as assessed  by reappearance  rate) or 
calving  difficulty.  Consequently  whilst  there is potential  to increase  carcass  value by up 
to €89/head,  realistically,  as most farmers  are already  using the better breeds, the 
potential  is approximately  €29/head,  which is equivalent  to 9c/kg carcass.
Fertility
Infertility  is a major  cost to the beef industry.  Fertility  in the suckler  herd can be assessed  
either as weaning  rate or reappearance  rate The target weaning  rate is 95 calves  
weaned/sold  per 100 cows put to the bull. Alternatively,  the target  reappearance  rate by 
day 390 post calving  is 78%. This allows  a 22% annual  culling  rate. In the recent  on- 
farm study on 43 farms across  Northern  Ireland  (Keady  et al., 2004b),  on average  only 
51% of suckler  cows produced  another  calf by day 390 post-calving.  In the past many  
cows may have been retained  in the herd because  of their need to draw  down  the suckler  
cow quota and their low cull value relative  to the higher  value of potential  replacement

the on-farm  study attained  reappearance  rates at day 390 post-calving  of 68%. Whilst 
there is a potential  benefit  from improved  fertility of over €140/head  on some farms,  
realistically  on most good farms  the potential  for improvement  is approximately  €57/head  
due to an improvement  in reappearance  rate by day 390 of 10%, which is equivalent  to 
17 c/kg carcass
Source  of replacements
Traditionally  suckler  cow replacements  were sourced  from the dairy herd However,  
recently  many  producers  are sourcing  their replacements  from within  their own herds  due 
to potential  detrimental  effects  of increasing  Holsteinisation  of the dairy herd on progeny  
carcass  conformation  and perceived  effects  on herd fertility Results  from an on-farm  
study in Northern  Ireland  (Kirkland  et al. 2004b)  using 5000 cows indicate  that:
1 Continental  x Holstein-Friesian  cows bred from the dairy herd produced  progeny  of 
similar  carcass  weight  and value  to those produced  from fl or more continental  dams  
bred from the beef herd
2 Angus  or Hereford  x Holstein  Friesian  dams  produce  progeny  with the lightest,  fattest  
and poorest  conformed  carcasses
3 Cows that were fl or more continental  had poorer  fertility than continental  cross  
Holstein  Friesian  dams.
Consequently,  replacement  suckler  cows can be sourced  from either  the dairy herd, or 
within the beef herd, producing  progeny  of similar  carcass  value However,  sourcing  
replacements  from within  the beef herd restricts  the choice  of terminal  sire breeds  that can 
be used, and this can reduce  progeny  carcass  value For example  in a 100-cow  herd, to 
obtain 20 replacements  it will be essential  to rear 25 heifer  calves To obtain 25 heifer 
calves,  at least 50 cows will need to be bred to the desired  breed Consequently,  when  
the male and unmated  female  progeny  are being sold, a loss in income  of up to €89 per 
carcass  due to reduced  carcass  weight and conformation  score  could be sustained,  which  
when  spread  over  the whole  herd is equivalent  to a loss of 13 c/kg carcass.  It makes  more  
financial  sense to breed the entire suckler  herd to the best terminal  sire breeds  and to 
purchase  suckler  cow replacements  from dairy farmers  or other beef producers
Nutrition  of cattle  in the growing  and finishing  periods
Grass  silaoe
Grass  silage  is still the basal  forage  for the majority  of beef  cattle  during  the indoor  feeding  
period in Ireland The feeding  value of grass silage is determined  by its intake  potential  
and digestibility  characteristics  and this has a ma)or impact on animal performance.  
Previous  studies (Steen, 1987) have shown that each one unit increase  in silage  
digestibility  increases  carcass  gain by 28 g/head  per day Harvest  date is the most  
important  factor affecting  silage digestibility.  For each week delay in harvest  date,  
digestibility  declines  by approximately  3 5 units of DMD (Keady  et al. 1999; Keady  et al. 
2000) Consequently,  to maintain  performance  of beef cattle, an additional  12 kg of 
concentrate  per day is required  for each week delay in harvest  date, due to decreased  
silage  digestibility  and lower intake characteristics  In order to produce  high DMD grass  
silage,  aim to harvest  the first cut by mid May and subsequent  cuts at 6-7 week intervals
The majority  of beef producers  produce  medium  feed value  grass  silage Potentially  they 
could increase  silage DMD by up to 10 units of DMD, but an increase  in silage DMD of 
5% units is probably  more realistic,  equivalent  to €71/head  over a finishing  animal ’s 
lifetime,  which equates  to 22 c/kg carcass
69
Grazing  management
Grass  forms  a major  part of the diet of beef cattle  during  their lifetime.  Grass  quantity  and 
quality, as well as previous  plane of nutrition,  are the major factors affecting  animal  
performance  during  the grazing  season.  However,  it is essential  that lifetime  performance  
be maximised  rather than performance  during the grazing  season alone Previous  
studies  (Steen  1996a)  have shown  that in a set stocking  situation,  grass height  should  be 
maintained  at 9 cm to maximise  beef cattle performance
In a paddock  grazing  situation,  to achieve  maximum  levels of gam, swards  should  be 
grazed down to 6 cm from April - June, increasing  to 8 cm in August  and 10 cm in 
September  To maintain  sward height  the stocking  density  needs  to be adjusted  during  
the grazing  season. For example,  the stocking  rate in the autumn  would need to be 
approximately  25-50%  of that in the early grazing  season Performance  in the late 
grazing  season  is often below  expectation  due to a shortage  of grass  as a consequence  
of high stocking  rate
Recent  studies  (Keady  et at, 2005a)  have shown that during the grazing  season  the 
same level of performance  can be obtained  by either decreasing  stocking  rate by 30% or 
by supplementing  with 200 kg concentrate/head  Consequently  good grassland 
management  can potentially  reduce  costs of production  by €35/head  or 11 c/kg carcass,  
equivalent  to the cost of 200 kg concentrate/head.
Alternative  forages
Currently  there is considerable  interest  in the use of alternative  forages,  particularly  
maize because  of their potentially  lower  cost of production  relative  to grass  silage  (Keady  
et at. 2002)  (Table  3) Furthermore  the development  of the complete  cover  plastic  mulch  
(CCPM)  system for maize production  has enabled  the use of higher yielding,  later 
maturing  varieties  coupled  with earlier sowing  dates  (Keady  2005). Recently  Keady  et at. 
(2005b)  evaluated  the effect  of including  maize  and whole  crop wheat  silages  in medium  
feed value  grass  silage  (70 DMD)  based  diets for finishing  beef cattle (Table  4) Including  
whole  crop wheat  as 40% of the forage  component  of the diet increased  feed intake,  did 
not alter carcass  gain and decreased  margins  by €14/head,  which is equivalent  to a 
reduction  of 4 c/kg carcass In contrast,  inclusion  of maize silage increased  carcass  
weight  by 14 kg and margin  over feed by €22, which is equivalent  to 7 c/kg carcass

Stage of maize  maturity  at harvest  and level of inclusion  in the diet affects  the response  
obtained  to maize  silage  inclusion  in beef  finishing  diets. Keady  and Gordon  (2006)  (Table  
5) concluded  that the affect  of stage of maturity  of maize  at harvest  on subsequent  animal  
performance  was dependant  on the level of inclusion  in the diet. Including  either  low or 
high dry matter  maize  as 0.5 of the forage  component  of the diet increased  carcass  gain, 
due to increased  forage  intake, and margin  over feed. However,  when maize replaced  
grass silage as the forage  component  of the diet, low dry matter  maize did not improve  
forage  intake  or carcass  gain, whilst  high dry matter  maize  silage  increased  carcass  gam 
and margin over feed by €42 relative to grass silage offered as the sole forage  
Furthermore,  it was concluded  that including  low and high dry matter  maize  as 50% of the 
forage  component  or feeding  ad-libitum  reduced  the required  concentrate  feed level by 
13, 1.3, 0 and 2.5 kg/head  per day to achieve  the same carcass  gam as feeding  grass  
silage as the sole forage  (Keady  and Gordon,  2006)

The value  of maize  silage,  at different  dry matter  concentrations,  relative  to barley  at 15% 
moisture  content,  at different  prices is presented  in Table 6. A cost of €14/t has been  
included  m the barley  price to cover  processing  costs. On a per tonne  of dry matter  basis,  
30% dry matter  maize  is valued  at 5% more per tonne relative  to 20% dry matter  maize
71
to reflect  the higher  feeding  value of high dry matter  maize An allowance  for 10% dry 
matter  losses  is included  for in-silo and feed-out  losses  with maize Furthermore,  it is 
assumed  that metabolisable  energy  from maize  silage  is utilised  at 95% of the efficiency  
of metabolisable  energy  from barley The price is per tonne of forage  exiting  the field 
haulage  for up to 5 miles and ensiling Thereafter  it is up to the purchaser  to carry the 
cost of haulage  over longer  distances For example  a 30% DM forage maize crop is 
worth €32 60 per t fresh compared  to barley  (15% moisture)  at €121/t

Supplement  management
Purchasing  grain off the combine  at harvest provides  an opportunity  to reduce  
supplement  feed costs Traditionally  grain was either  dried or treated  with propionic  acid 
and processed  prior to feeding. Recent  innovations  in grain management  have resulted  
in the development  of crimping  and urea treatments  in which grain is harvested  at 
approximately  30 to 35% moisture. For crimping,  grain is passed  through  a crimper,  
cracking  the grain, which  is then treated  with an additive  to prevent  aerobic  deterioration,  
ensiled  in a conventional  silage pit and compacted.  Urea treatment  involves  mixing  the 
grain  with urea and water  in a forage  wagon  and then ensiling  in a conventional  silage  pit. 
Recently  the effect  of grain storage  and processing  method  on performance  of beef cattle  
has been evaluated  (Keady  and Kilpatrick,  2005) Grain  was either  conventionally  stored,  
treated  with propionic  acid and rolled prior to feeding,  crimped  or urea-treated,  and 
offered  to finishing  beef cattle (Table  7).

Urea treatment  increased  silage intake, but reduced  liveweight  and carcass  gains by 6 
and 8% respectively  Crimping  did not alter feed intake  or animal  performance  compared  
to propionic  acid treatment  Method  of grain storage  or processing  did not alter kill-out  
percentage,  carcass  conformation  or fat classification  grades. Similarly  in a more recent  
study Keady  and Kilpatrick  {2006a)  reported  carcass  weights  of 383, 375 and 385 kg for 
cattle offered  conventionally  stored (propionic  acid treated  and rolled prior to feeding),  
crimped  and urea treated  wheat respectively  Supplement  costs may be reduced  by 
purchasing  grain off the combine  at harvest  and storing  either treated  with propionic  acid 
and rolled prior to feeding  or crimped  and ensiled.  When purchasing  grain it is essential  
to value  on a per tonne  of dry matter basis For example,  if grain is valued  at €110 at 20% 
moisture  off the combine,  it is worth €89, €96 and €103 per tonne fresh weight  at 65%,  
70% and 75% dry matter  respectively.
A number  of research  studies  have evaluated  the feed and financial  values  of different 
straight  feeds for feeding to finishing  beef cattle when compared  with barley and 
soyabean  meal. Simple  mixes  of high quality  straights  can support  high levels  of animal  
performance  Using prices of straights  obtained  from merchants  in the Midlands  and 
Southeast  with prices  of €134/tonne  and €236/tonne  for barley  and soyabean  respectively,  
barley,  maize  distillers  rapeseed  and maize  gluten  are good value for money  (Table  8).
More recently  Keady  et al. (2004a)  have shown  that when the same feed ingredients  are 
included  in the supplement,  similar  levels of animal  performance  are obtained  when the 
supplement  is fed either as a pelleted  ration  or coarse  mix (Table  9). Consequently,  there  
is potential  on some farms  to reduce  supplement  cost by over €21/tonne  However,  on 
those farms  currently  feeding  straights  the potential  is approximately  €10/head,  which is 
equivalent  to 3 c/kg carcass

With the cessation  of the Special  Beef Premium  (SBP)  many producers  are interested  in 
finishing  male cattle intact as bulls rather than as steers. Previous  research  (Steen  
1996b) evaluated  the effects of finishing  male cattle either as bulls or steers and 
compared  them to heifers  (Table 10). When slaughtered  at a constant  age, bulls had 
increased  carcass  weights  of 43 and 69 kg relative  to steers  and heifers  respectively  
Furthermore  all bulls achieved  the premium  conformation  grades  (E, U and R) whereas  
12 and 10% of steer and heifers graded O respectively.  In comparison  to steers,  
carcasses  of heifers  were 26 kg lighter. Furthermore,  the carcasses  of heifers  were fatter  
than steers with 60% and 30% of the heifer and steer carcasses  grading  fat class 4 
respectively.  Consequently  when slaughtered  at the same age, finishing  cattle as bulls 
increases  carcass  weight by 43 kg (for an increased  intake of only 4%) which is 
equivalent  to €104 extra margin/head.  In practice,  finishing  cattle as bulls could reduce  
average  costs of production  by €51/head,  as half of the progeny  from the beef herd are 
heifers. This saving  is equivalent  to 16 c/kg carcass.
Table 10. A comparison  of bulls,  steers  and heifers  for beef production

Carcass  weight  (kg) 353 310 284
(Steen,  1996b)
As the weight  of finishing  heifers  and steers  increases  the food conversion  ratio rFCR)  
increases  (i.e. it takes  extra feed to put on each kg of carcass).  The genetic  potential  of 
progeny  from the suckler  herd has increased  considerably  in the last 20 years  due to the 
increasing  proportion  of continental  genetics.  Recently  the effects  of weight  at slaughter  
on animal  performance  of young  bulls from the suckler herd have been evaluated  Keady  
and Kilpatrick  (2006b)  slaughtered  bulls at different  weights  ranging  from 500 to 800 kg 
(Table 11) and concluded  that increasing  the weight at slaughter  did not alter daily 
liveweight,  gain, carcass  gain or kill out proportion.  Whilst  the FCR increased  marginally  
from 9.5 to 10.6 kg feed/kg  carcass  at slaughter  weights  of 500 and 800 kg respectively,  
the data clearly  illustrates  that bulls from the suckler  herd, even when slaughtered  at 
heavy  liveweights  are extremely  efficient  in producing  carcass  weight. Furthermore  these  
bulls could have been taken to heavier  weights  costs effectively  provided  that there is a 
market  requirement.
74
Many producers  finishing  young bulls offer ad libitum concentrate  diets Keady and 
Kilpatrick  (2006b)  concluded  that replacing  50% of an ad libitum  concentrate  diet with high 
feed value grass silage (Dry matter  = 23 8%, DMD = 80%) resulted  in the same daily 
liveweight  gain and carcass  classification  but reduced  carcass  weight  by only 7kg during  
a 240 finishing  period  (Table  12). Furthermore  replacing  ad libitum  concentrate  diets with 
a 50:50 high feed value grass sllage  concentrate  diet increased  margin over feed by 
€22/head  during  a 240 day finishing  period. Consequently  young bulls from the suckler  
herd can be finished  at heavy slaughter  weights  efficiently. Furthermore  replacing  
concentrate  with high feed value  grass  silage  increases  margin  over feed.

Finishing  male cattle as bulls increases  food conversion  efficiency  and animal 
performance.  Flowever,  care is required  when handling  these animals,  particularly  in a 
grazing  situation.  Ensure  that there is a market  outlet  for bulls prior  to proceeding  to finish  
male animals  intact.
The future
Maximum  potential,  and potential  in practice  for improvements  in efficiency,  which are 
possible  on beef farms, are summarised  in Table 13 The data in Table 13 demonstrate 
that if all the individual  potential  in practice  Improvements  in efficiency  in genetics  of the 
beef herd and in nutrition  during  the growing  and finishing  phases  were achieved,  the cost
75
of production  could be reduced  by up to 106 c/kg carcass. However,  whilst  all of these  
individual  improvements  are possible,  they are not cumulative  and consequently  are not 
possible  for every beef animal  produced

However,  on most farms  it should  be possible  to achieve  half of the potential  in practice  
improvements  in efficiency.  Consequently  improvements  in efficiency  could reduce  costs  
of production  by up to 53 c/kg carcass. These  improvements  in efficiency  Increase  in 
value as the beef price obtained  by the producer  improves.
The average  beef price in 2004 was €2.48/kg carcass,  whilst subsidy  accounted  for 
€1.60/kg  carcass  beef produced  in Ireland  giving  a total income  of €4.08/kg carcass  beef 
Improvements  in efficiency  could reduce  cost of production  by up to 53 c/kg carcass  
Consequently,  the producer  would require an average  of €3 55/kg carcass post 
decoupling  to maintain  the status  quo in nominal  terms
Conclusions
It is concluded  that:
1 Improvements  in efficiency  pre farm gate of up to 53 c/kg carcass  are possible
2 Major  improvements  in efficiency  pre farm gate can be achieved  by:
improvements  in cow fertility
sourcing  suckler  cow replacements  from the dairy herd
use of continental  breeds,  particularly  Charolais  and Blonde,  as terminal  sires
production  of high feed value grass silage
use of forage  maize  in the finishing  diet
reducing  supplement  cost by use of good quality  straights
good grazing  management
finish male progeny  as bulls
3. The value of the improvements  in efficiency  increases  with improvements  in beef 
price.
4. As beef  prices  increase  use of high input  systems,  e g. ad libitum  concentrate  feeding,  
can become  more attractive
5 Even with these  savings  the producer  needs  to receive  on average  €3 55/kg carcass  
to compensate  for subsidy  removal  post decoupling  to maintain  status  quo
