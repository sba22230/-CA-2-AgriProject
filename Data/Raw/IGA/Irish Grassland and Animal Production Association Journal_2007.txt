Dairy farming  stocked  at 170kg organic  nitrogen/ha  (2 
cows/ha)  - a farmers  perspective

Objective
The objective  of this paper  is to examine  the implications  of the ‘Nitrate  Directive ’ on 
a dairy farm stocked  at 170kg organic  nitrogen/ha.  The farm is situated  outside  
Ballyporeen,  Co Tipperary,  and comprises  a total of 51,8 ha (50 ha adjusted)  milking  
60 cows to fill 71,543  gallons in spring milk production.  The farm supplies  to 
Dairygold,  and has been in REPS (Rural Environment  Protection  Scheme)  for the 
past 3 years.
The herd traditionally  comprised  mostly  black and white Holstein  Friesian  cows, but 
in the last number of years  the breeding  policy  has switched  to mostly  high EBI New 
Zealand  sires (see Table  1). No stock bull is used.
Table  1. Bulls  used in 2005 and 2006
2005  RUU, UYC and LWK
2006 HZO, KLA, UYC and LWK
Average  yield per cow Is approximately  1250 gallons  at 3.45%  protein  and 3.90%  fat. 
The farm is stocked  at 1.6 LU/ha. Due to drought  conditions  in 2006, 650kg  of meal 
per cow was fed, but more  typically  this figure  is 450kg/cow.
Until recently  the majority  of the bull calves  were kept until weanling  stage  and sold 
out of the shed in the spring. However,  in 2007, most of the bulls were sold as 
calves  at three  weeks  of age. All heifer  calves  are kept. There  are also a number  of 
Norwegian  Red crossbreds  and purebred  replacements  on the farm as part of a 
Moorepark  ‘on farm' trial testing  these  animals. The Teagasc  Profit Monitor  for the 
farm in 2005 indicated  Common  Profit of 14.94  c/litre and Common  Costs of 15 17 
c/litre. No figures  are available  for 2006.
Winter housing  arrangements
Cubicle  accommodation  is available  for 65 cows. Prior to calving  the cows are 
grouped  on a calving  date basis, and those near calving  are fed late in the day A 
further  30 cows are housed  in older  cubicles  and slatted  area e g. cull cows and any 
late calvers. A separate  shed with smaller  cubicles  and a scraper  system  has the 
capacity  to deal with 40 weanlings.  These  have access  to an easy feed area for 
silage  and meals.
Slurry storage  capacity  is sufficient  to comply  with the 'Nitrate  Directive'.  It will be 
necessary  to modify  the existing  yard to cater  for soiled  water. The milking  parlour  is 
a 10-unit  herringbone  with 3 foot centres.
Grass  silage  forms  the mainstay  of the  winter  diet. A total of 46 acres are closed  for 
first cut silage, and any additional  surpluses  removed  via round bale silage 
(approximately  = 6.5 acres in bales).
What  happens  when  cows  calve?
The aim on the farm is to get cows out to grass directly  after calving. Fresh calvers  
are out from Febmary  1 by day and full time by March  1 depending  on grass growth.  
They are fed on 4-5kg of meal and some grass silage by night. Grass silage is 
removed  from the diet as soon as grass  supply  improves.
Grass growth  is measured  weekly  in order  to calculate  farm cover  during  the early  
and main grazing  season. This facilitates  assessment  of growth rate relative  to 
demand,  and all decisions  based on this. Approximately  8-9 acres are reseeded  
annually  because  old paddocks  are slow to grow grass  in the spring.
Stock  numbers  and organic  nitrogen  and phosphorus  calculations
The current  position  is as shown  in Table  2.

Dividing  these total figures  by net area (50ha),  total Organic  N/ha = 130kg/ha.  In 
REPS  a further  130kg  of bag nitrogen  is permitted,  bringing  the total nitrogen  level to 
260kg/ha.  There  is a further  2 years left in REPS 3, which must be completed.  As 
the farm is under  the 170 kg organic  nitrogen  limit, no derogation  will be required.
Fertiliser  programme
Slurry
Most of the slurry goes out on the silage ground  after cutting. This reduces  the 
requirement  for bag nitrogen  considerably.  Two of the smaller  tanks are emptied  in 
January  and February.
Fertiliser
Under  the new Nitrate  regulations,  if stocked  at 130kg  organic  nitrogen/ha  the farm 
IS in the same bracket  as farmers  under 170 kg/ha. This would allow for the 
spreading  of 226kg/ha  of available  nitrogen,  equating  to 214kg  of bag fertiliser  or 171 
units/acre  that is 6.3 bags CAN/acre.  With adherence  to the nitrogen  limits set down  
in REPS  3, the maximum  amount  that may be applied  over the whole  farm is 3 85 
bags of CAN/acre.  The strategy  followed  is to apply 0.5 bags of urea on reseeded  
pasture  (silage  ground  and some paddocks)  in mid February.  Another  0 5 bags of 
urea on grazing  ground  in early  April, followed  by a 0.5 bags CAN after  each grazing.  
A final blanket  application  of 0.75 bags of CAN is applied  in mid/late  AUGUST.  One 
round  of fertiliser  is skipped  in July when  the whole farm is available  for grazing.

Implications  of new rules  for the business
• Stocking  rate - As the farm is under  the 170kg  limit, there is no need for an 
organic  nitrogen  derogation.  By selling  bull calves  at 4 weeks  of aqe allows  
the farm to stay below  the 170kg limit.
• Fertiliser  - The new rules will not reduce  the amount  of bag nitrogen  that can 
be spread.
• Slurry  storage  - There is adequate  storage  for the 16 week closed  period.  
Some  minor  changes  will have to be made  so that soiled  water/slurry  from the 
milking  parlour  can be catered  for.
• Closed  periods  - In REPS you are required  to finish spreading  bag fertiliser  
by August  31. This means  the new rules should  not be more restrictive  In a 
normal  year, no nitrogen  is spread  before  mid February.
Dairy  farming  at 250 kg organic  N/ha (2.9 cows/ha)
Kenneth  Jennings 
Finnis,  Bandon,  Co Cork
Introduction
The objective  of this paper  is to illustrate  the basics  of the new Nitrates  Directive  as it 
impacts  on a typical  dairy farm. The farm in question  comprises  a total of 25.4 
hectares  (62.7 acres),  with 47 adjusted  acres on the home block  and 12.5 acres at a 
distance  of 2 miles. In the 2006/07 production  year, 50 cows produced  
approximately  70,000  gallons  in spring milk production  (1,490 gallons/acre).  The 
intention  for 2010 is to produce  70 to 75,000  gallons  in spring  milk production.
The land base is restricted  for several  reasons:
• Coilte  has a coniferous  forest,  which  bounds  the farm on one side;
• The Bandon  area is a hugely  intensive  area for dairying  and demand  for land 
both to buy and rent is very high - €200/acre  annual  rent is common;
• The wealth  of the construction  industry  is driving  land price out of agricultural 
reach, eg. asking price for a 27 acre block of land = + €1 million  
(€37,000/acre).
Cows  are black  and white Holstein-Friesian.  Al has been used extensively  in the last 
number  of years,  e.g., in 2005  - RUU, PGZ, LOO, BCG and ERC: 2006; ERC, DXA,  
LOO and NWF. A Friesian  stock  bull is used to mop up.
In 2006 the first year in spring  milk, production  yield averaged  1,450 gallons/cow  at 
3.30%  protein  (217 kg protein)  and 3.88%  fat (256 kg fat), a total of 472 kg of milk 
solids  per cow. A total of 900 kg of meal per cow was fed in 2006.
For the last number  of years most of the bull calves  were kept until 16 to 18 months  
of age and finished  as bulls for slaughter.  In 2007 all bull calves  were sold at three  
weeks  of age due to the increase  in stocking  rate.
Winter housing  arrangements
There  is cubicle  accommodation  for 66 cows, with a separate  shed for in calf heifers  
and weanlings.  Slurry storage  capacity  complies  with the Nitrates  Directive.  The 
milking  parlour (built in 1995)  is a low line, 5-unit  double  up with 2 foot 6  inch centres.
Grass  silage  forms  the mainstay  of the winter  diet. First cut silage is taken  from the 
12.5 acre block away from the main farm, with surplus  paddocks  removed  as they 
arise (in 2006 approximately  9 acres was conserved  from the home farm, with a 
further  15 acres  of first and second  cut grass  silage  purchased).
What  happens  when  cows  calve?
Prior  to switching  to spring  calving,  the aim was to get cows out to grass as soon as 
there was significant  grass growth. Typically  winter  milkers  went out from February 
20 to March  15. depending  on grass growth. For the future  the plan is to get cows  
out even earlier  as the herd is now spring  calving  only. Great  care must be taken  to 
avoid poaching  paddocks.  A stand off pad is used if ground  conditions  are poor.  
Due to the high stocking  rates, it has not been possible  to reseed  paddocks,  but 
continuous  grazing  keeps  swards  in good condition.  Strip grazing  is used to ensure  
paddocks  are well grazed  down.

Divide  these total figures  by net area (adjusted)  = 25.45 (SFP application)  organic  
nitrogen/ha  = 261 kg/ha.
This means  there is a requirement  to;
(a) Reduce  stock  numbers,  or;
(b) Increase  land base — even with an 'Organic  Nitrogen  derogation ’ he farm is 
still too heavily  stocked.
For 2007  the Intention  is to reduce  weanling  numbers  to bring the farm under  the 250 
kg limit-see  Table  2.

Dividing  total figures by net area (adjusted)  = 25.45 (SFP application),  organic 
nitrogen/ha  = 248 kg/ha. By reducing  weanlings  from 36 to 23 brings  the farm under  
250 kg organic  nitrogen/ha  and within  'Derogation territory ’.
Inputting  these stock figures into the Teagasc  Fertiliser  Programme,  the farm is 
allowed  spread:
• 4 tonnes  of Urea (1.27 bags urea/acre)
• 17 tonnes  of CAN (7.4 bags CAN/acre)  - can all be applied  as CAN if so 
desired.
The total P and K figures  are 0.7 t of 0:10:20  (14 bags in total), or 1.1 t of 0:7:30  (22 
bags in total).
Fertiliser  programme  ‘Old’ and ‘New ’
Slurry  - There  is good use of slurry  in the front half of the season.  It is very valuable 
and replaces  bag nitrogen  in the system. Better  results  are got earlier  rather  than 
spreading  after  first cut silage. Approximately  80% of the slurry  is spread  by April 1, 
and slurry is spread  from mid January  on the paddocks  that will be last in the first 
rotation.
Bag fertiliser  - 0.75 bags of urea is spread  in late January  on paddocks  that get 
slurry. On those that don’t receive  any slurry they get 1.5 bags of pasture  sward.  
During  the main grazing  season  the grazing  rotation  usually  goes  from 25 to 28 days,  
with one bag of CAN spread  after  each grazing.

Implications  of the new rules  for the business
• Reduce  stock  - To get within ’Nitrogen  Derogation  levels ’ weanling  numbers  
will have  to be reduced  to bring the business  under  the 250 kg limit.
• Increase  area farmed  - As already  outlined  this is a difficult  option.
Bag fertiliser  rules — Considering  the quantities  previously  spread,  it should  
be possible  to stay within  the targets  set out in the new 'Nitrate  rules ’. If more  
silage  was grown  as opposed  to purchased,  then the limits would  be in danger 
of being  breeched.
Closed  spreading  periods  - In general  the closed  periods  will not restrict  the 
potential  of the farming  system  (slurry  can be spread  from January  12, whilst 
all spreading  of bag fertiliser  has to be completer  by September  15).
Scaling  up - It will be necessary  to apply  for the Organic  Nitrogen  Derogation  
to 250 kg/ha. If the option  to increase  cow numbers  is pursued,  it will have to 
be via contract  rearing  of heifers  to reduce  stock  numbers  further on the farm.  
Another  option  is to increase  milk yield per cow by introducing  more feed, but 
this requires  careful  consideration.
Conclusions
The biggest  challenge  will be to produce  milk efficiently  on the 'home  farm ’ and stay 
within  the stocking  rate rules laid out in the Nitrates  directive.  In general  the fertiliser 
rules or closed  periods  are not considered  detrimental  to future  progress.

Introduction
The present  EU dairy market  regime  combines  price support,  through  measures  like 
intervention  buying, import tariffs and export subsidies,  with milk quotas  to limit 
production  levels. The 2003 reform  of CAP agreed  to retain the present  milk quota 
system  until April 1, 2015, however,  it is expected  that the quota issue will form an 
important  part of the 2008 review  of CAP. The EU Commission ’s wish to phase  out 
milk quotas  coincides  with a desire  to have a lower milk price in order  to cope with 
lower import tariffs and end export refunds, to avoid possible pressure  for 
compensation  for loss of quota assets,  avoid pressure  from new member  states  for 
additional  quota  and pressure  from free-market  member states  (the London  group)  to 
end milk quotas. It is clear from this that the Irish dairy farming  sector  is facing 
challenges  and continued  technical  innovation  based  on increased  performance  from 
grazed  grass is very important  for the sustainability  of Irish dairy farming  in the long 
term.
One of the major  competitive  advantages  that Ireland  has over most EU countries  is 
the potential  production  of between  12 to 16t DM/hectare  over a long growing  season  
from pasture. This is most efficiently  converted  into milk when grazed  in-situ. It is 
envisaged  that the cost of both concentrate  feed and grass silage will continue  to 
increase  over the coming  years  - in the former  due to increased  world demand  and 
lower supplies,  and the latter due to increases  in contractor  charges  associated  with 
inflation  in labour,  energy and machinery  costs. In recent  years  grazing  management 
strategies  have been identified  that increase  the proportion  of grazed  grass and 
reduce  the dependency  on grass  silage  in Irish systems  of milk production.
The Nitrate  Directive  was introduced  with the aims to protect  water  quality  against 
pollution  from agricultural  sources,  with a primary  emphasis  on better  management 
of livestock  manure  and other organic  fertilizer.  The Nitrate  Directive  set a legal limit 
of 170kg of organic  nitrogen  that can be applied  per hectare  (a stocking  rate of 2 
LU/ha). A derogation  has been obtained  that will allow dairy farmers  increase  
stocking  rate up to 250kg  of organic  N/ha. This is important  as a 170kg limit of 
organic  nitrogen  across  all dairy farms  would  erode  the competitiveness  of the grass  
based  system  in Ireland  relative  to other  higher  input systems  in the EU.
This paper discusses  optimum  present  day and futuristic  grass-based  systems  of 
milk production,  taking  into account  new environmental  and possible  future  EU policy  
changes.
Productivity  of Irish grassland
Land use and soils
The total land area in Ireland  is 6.9 million  hectares  of which  4.3 million  hectares  is 
used for agriculture  and 0.7 million  hectares  for forestry  purposes.  Ninety  percent  of 
agricultural  land is devoted  to grass and 10% to arable agriculture.  Dry lowland  
mineral  soils account  for about 62% of the agricultural  area, while moderately  wet 
mineral  soils account  for 20%, and wet impermeable  mineral  soils for around  17% 
(Coulter  et al., 1996). Some 50% of the land area of the country  is generally 
classified  as good agricultural  land.
Table 1 shows  the proportion  of grassland  area by farming  type and corresponding 
fertiliser  usage. Of the total arable  and grassland  area 36% is farmed  under the 
Rural Environment  Protection  Scheme  (REPS),  47% is farmed  extensively,  7% is 
farmed  intensively  and the remaining  10% is used for arable  agriculture.  REPS is a 
scheme designed  to reward farmers for carrying out their activities in an 
environmentally  friendly  manner  and to bring about environmental  improvement  on 
farms. The objectives  of the scheme  are (i) to establish  farming  practices  and 
production  methods  that reflect  the increasing  concern  for conservation,  landscape  
protection,  and wider  environmental  problems.  In return for payments  this scheme  
requires  compliance  with environmental  conditions  that limit nitrogen  from organic 
fertiliser  to 170kg/ha/year  and total nitrogen  input  to a maximum  of 260kg/ha/year,  (ii) 
to protect  wildlife  habitats  and endangered  species  of flora and fauna and (iii) to 
produce  quality  food in an extensive  and environmentally  friendly  manner.  Currently 
there are 49,500 farmers  participating  in the scheme,  75% of which  is financed  by the 
EU and the remaining  25% by the Irish exchequer.  It is projected  that the number  of 
farmers  participating  in REPS  will increase  from 49,500  (August  2006)  to 55,000  by 
the end of the year.

Productivity  of Irish grassland
Very high levels of grass dry matter (DM) production  are possible  under Irish 
conditions.  The potential  productivity  can be assessed  from ryegrass  cultivar 
evaluations  carried  out by the Department  of Agriculture  and Food (DAFF)  at five 
widely  distributed  locations  around  Ireland. Under  ideal conditions,  the production  
capacity  of newly sown perennial  ryegrass  is approximately  17.6 tDM/ha/annum
(Table  2). This compares  favourably  with the dry matter  production  of forage  maize 
(uncovered  -12.8  tDM/ha)  under  Irish conditions.

*No data available
However,  while these data provide  an indication  of potential  grassland  productivity,  
they are not representative  of typical grassland  in Ireland. The productivity  of 
grassland  is being assessed  on an on-going  basis at various  Teagasc  (Agriculture  
and Food Development  Authority)  research  stations  (Table  3). Permanent  grassland 
swards  are harvested  under  simulated  grazing  using methodology  outlined  by Corral 
and Fenlon  (1978). The productivity  of grassland  has been reasonably  consistent  at 
between  13.6 and 15.8 tDM/ha (averaging  14.5 t/ha) across a range of sites 
spanning  the length  and breadth  of the country.

Brereton  (1995) using a modelling  approach  estimated  that the productivity  of 
grassland  ranged  from 11 tDM/ha  in the northern  parts of Ireland  to 15 tDM/ha  in the 
southwest  based  on a chemical  N input of 250kg/ha  (Figure  1). Brereton,  Danielov  
and Scott (1996),  in a modelling  exercise,  estimated  the total annual  grass  dry matter 
production  for Western  Europe  to be up to 2 tonnes  of DM less than in Ireland.

Length  of grass  arowiriQ  season
Generally,  air or soil temperatures  determine  the beginning  and end of the grass­
growing  season. Broad  and Hough  (1993),  considered  the beginning  of the growing  
season  to be delineated  by an air temperature  of 5 to 5.5°C and the end of the 
growing  season  by an air temperature  of 8°C. Hence, grass growth continues  
virtually  all year round in the south  west of Ireland  and for around  250 days in inland  
areas  of the northeast  (Figure  2).
Figure  2. Average  length  of the grass-growing  season  in Ireland  (Brereton  
1995)

Brereton  et al., (1995)  estimated  that mean  grass  growth  rates over a 150-day  winter  
period (November  1 to March 31) varied from 5kg DM/ha/d  in northern  parts of 
Ireland to 11kg DM/ha/d  along the south-west  coast of Ireland. Brereton  and 
McGilloway  (1999), recorded  average  grass growth rates of 5.0kg DM/ha/d  at 
Moorepark  between  November  1 and March 21, (140 days). Also at Moorepark,  
O'Donovan  et al., (2004)  recorded  average  daily grass  growth  rates of 13.5kg  DM/ha  
between  October  20 and March 18 (159 days) over three years. Hennessy  (2004) 
recorded  average  growth  rates of 6.1 kg DM/ha/d  at Grange  in the Northeast  and 11.9 
kg DM/ha/d  at Moorepark  between  October  10 and February  20 (133 days)  over two 
winter periods. Therefore,  in general,  grass growth rates in Ireland will range  
between  5 and 12kg DM/ha/d  during the winter period depending  on location.  
Assuming  a winter  period  extending  from November  1 to March  1 (120 days), grass  
accumulation  during  this period  is between  600 and 1400kg  DM/ha.
Trends  in chemical  fertiliser use in Ireland
The average  chemical  fertiliser  nitrogen  use on grassland  in Ireland  is 82kg/ha/year.  
Data from the National  Fam Survey  2000 (Connolly  et al., 2001) indicate  that 
average  stocking  rates on dairy farms in Ireland  are just less than 2 livestock  units 
per hectare.  Average  annual  fertiliser  nitrogen  use on such dairy  farms  was recorded  
as 176kg/ha,  while annual  fertiliser  phosphorus  use was recorded  as 12kg/ha.  There 
was an upward  trend in annual  fertiliser  nitrogen  use in Ireland  during the 1990 ’s 
(Figure  3). This coincided  to some extent  with the increases  in livestock  numbers  
during this period. However,  since peaking  at over 440,000  t/year during 1999,  
annual  fertiliser  nitrogen  use declined  to 363,000  t in 2004 and declined  further  to 
352,000 1 in 2005.
Annual  fertiliser  phosphorus  use in Ireland  was approximately  60,000  t of elemental 
phosphorus  between  1991 and 1997 and then fell sharply  to around 50,000 t 
between  1998 and 2000, before declining  to its 2004 level of under 43,000  t and 
declined  further to 38,600  tonnes  in 2005 (Figure  3). The decline  in national  fertiliser  
phosphorus  usage since 1997 is partly due to a campaign  by Teagasc  which  
commenced  in 1996, to increase  awareness  among farmers  and bring fertiliser  
phosphorus  inputs more in line with requirements.  It also coincided  to a certain  
extent  with a substantial  number  of farmers  Joining  the REPS.

Nitrogen  and phosph orus loading  from livestock  manure  in Ireland  
Using Irish National  Farm Survey  data from 2002, the number  and type of farms  that 
currently  exceed  an output  of 170kg  nitrogen  per hectare  from livestock  manure  can 
be Identified  (Table  4). By applying  the nitrogen  production  per head figures  (Table  
4) to animal  numbers  on survey  farms, levels of nitrogen  per hectare  from livestock 
rnanure  of utilised  agricultural  area can be estimated.  This provides  an insight  into 
the number  of farmers  currently  exceeding  the limit as a result of the number  of 
grazing  livestock  maintained  on the holding.

Dairy specialist  farms are those with over 66% of the standardoross margin  fromthe dairy  enterprise  (National  Farm Survey  data 2002).
Approximately  30% of specialist  dairy farms and 20% of mixed  dairy farms  currently 
exceed  the 170kg  limit compared  to 9% across  all systems.  Almost  33% of the Irish 
nahonal  milk quota is produced  on farms that are currently  producing  more than 
1 rOkg of nitrogen  per hectare  from livestock  manure.
13
The above  estimate  of the number  of holdings  exceeding  the 170 kg nitrogen  limit 
has been confirmed  by a preliminary  analysis  of Irelands  Cattle  Movement  Monitoring  
System  (CMMS  database  2005).
Competitive  factors  in relation  to grassland  systems  in Ireland  
Competitiveness
The relative competitiveness  (using partial indicators)  of Irish specialist  milk 
producers  vis-a-via  those in Belgium,  Denmark,  France,  Germany,  Italy, and the 
Netherlands  using data from the European  Commission’ s Farm Accountancy  Data 
Network  (FADN)  (Thome  and Fingleton,  2005) was measured  in relation  to milk 
production,  stocking  rate and labour  productivities.  The measures  were:
• Milk  solids  per cow (kg)
• Stocking  rate (livestock  units/ha)
• Milk  solids  (kg of fat plus protein)  per hectare
• Milk production  per labour  unit (tonne).
Figure  4 shows  that the average  milk solids per cow were lowest  in Ireland. The 
results  presented  for each of the countries  is the average  for the years 1996 to 2003 
and indexed  relative  to Ireland. In particular,  milk solids per cow in the Netherlands 
and Denmark  were 66% and 52% higher, respectively,  than in Ireland. Similarly 
stocking  rates in Ireland  were low; with only France  and Germany  having  stocking 
densities  equivalent  or lower than Ireland. Stocking  rates in the Netherlands  and 
Denmark  were 34% and 30% higher  than in Ireland.

The combination  of the generally  lower stocking  densities  and lower milk solids per 
cow for Ireland,  result in Ireland  having  the lowest  milk solids  per hectare  compared  
with all other countries  with the exception  of France. The Netherlands  and Denmark  
again produced  well in excess  of the other countries  examined,  with milk solids  
production  per hectare  200 per cent higher  than Ireland. The final partial  productivity 
measure  - milk production  per labour  unit was again highest  in the Netherlands  and 
Denmark,  with levels in the UK also relatively  high. Italy was the only country  that 
exhibited  lower labour productivity  than Ireland,  but average  levels in France  and 
Germany  were very similar  to Ireland.
The results  for the individual  years between  1996 and 2003 exhibited  a significant 
trend over time for three of the six partial  productivity  indicators,  namely:  milk solids  
per cow, stocking  rate per hectare  and milk solids per hectare. Of these indicators,  
milk solids per cow for Irish dairy farms increased  significantly  by on average  0.012  
kg per cow per year relative  to the average  of all countries.  In contrast,  stocking  rate 
(cows per hectare)  and milk solids per hectare  decreased  relative  to the average  of 
all countries  examined,  by on average  0.01 cows per hectare  and 0.09kg  of milk 
solids  per hectare  respectively,  over  the time period  examined.
Farming  system
Using 2004 National  Farm Survey data (Connolly  et al., 2004) and nitrogen  
production  figures per head of animal (S.l. 378, DAF 2006), Table 5 shows the 
number  and percentage  of specialist  dairy farms operating  at different  rates of 
organic  N per hectare.

Table 6 Shows farm performance  Indicators  at various rates of organic  N per 
hectare. The results  show  that on average  farms participating  in the REPS  scheme  
were 43 hectares  compared  to an average  of all specialist  dairy  farms  of 51 hectares.  
Those  operating  at less than 170kg per hectare  but not in the REPS scheme  are 
larger  than average.  This may suggest that  as farm size increases  the attractiveness  
of REPS declines  because  of the capped  level of payment. Farms in the REPS  
scheme  tend to have smaller  than average  total livestock  units, while farms  
intensively  stocked,  i.e. 170kg per hectare  or greater,  tend to have larger than 
average  livestock  numbers. The differences  in milk quota sizes are large and 
statistically  significant,  with farmers  in REPS having the smallest  quota size and 
those operating  at 170kg  per hectare  and greater  having  the largest. The average  
REPS  payment  for farms  in the scheme  was €6,250.

The more intensively  stocked  famns are producing  a significantly  higher  profit per 
hectare  of land farmed (€1,011 per hectare  for those over 170Kg per hectare,  
compared  to an average  of €854). When  REPS  payments  are included  the farms  in 
the REPS  scheme  are operating  only slightly  below  the non-REPS  farms in the less 
than 170kg  per hectare  group. The net margin  per labour  unit employed  is higher  on 
the more intensively  stocked  farms  but the difference  is not significant.
The results  show only marginal  differences  in the average  milk deliveries  per cow 
across the groups and the differences  are not significant.  Figure 5 graphs  the 
distribution  function  of yield per cow for the different  groups. There is a larger 
percentage  of the more intensive  farms  (>170)  supplying  milk at 4,000 litres or less, 
(15% of >170 farms compared  to 11% of <170 farms) and there is smaller 
percentage  of them supplying  milk at 6,000 litres or more. However  the majority  of 
intensively  stocked farms have higher milk yields than their more extensive 
counterparts.  About  40% of intensive  farms  have yields  of between  5,000  and 6,000 
litres compared  to just 28% of the farms  operating  at 170kg N per hectare  or less.
16

The results  show  that on average,  farms operating  at 170kg N per hectare  or higher  
tend to have higher direct costs of production  (10.3 cent per litre relative  to an 
average  across all farms of 9.6 cent). The concentrates  fed per cow and the 
chemical  nitrogen  applied  per hectare  are higher  on the more intensively  stocked 
farms,  this contributes  to the higher  direct  costs per litre. While  the overhead  costs  
are marginally  lower on the more intensively  stocked  farms, the difference  is not 
significant.  Additionally  the difference  in total costs of production  per litre of milk 
produced  and net margin  per litre are relatively small  and statistically  not significant.
It seems  then that the more intensively  stocked  farms  have significantly  higher  direct  
costs of production,  and while on average  they have a lower net margin  per litre 
produced,  the difference  is not statistically  significant.  Additionally  when the whole  
farm is considered  these  farms have a higher  profit per hectare  and per labour  unit 
than the other  two groups.
Nitrogen  use for milk production
Profitable  dairy farming  in Ireland  depends  on a high volume  of milk sales off the 
farm. This can best be achieved  by achieving  high milk yield per cow at relatively 
high stocking  rates from grazed  grass. This system  depends  on strategic  application  
of fertilizer  nitrogen  over the grazing  season. The level of fertilizer  nitrogen  will be 
influenced  by:
• Grass  DM response  to fertiliser nitrogen,
• The  cost of the fertilizer  nitrogen  relative  to milk price,
• The  cost of alternative  feeds  to grazed  grass,
• The ability  of the dairy  farmer  to use the extra grass DM produced  to increase  
milk output.
17
• Compliance  with fertilizer  regulations  and environmental  implications.
Grass  DM response  to fertiliser nitrogen
Figure  6 shows  the relationship  between  nitrogen  fertilizer  application  rate and grass  
DM production  (obtained  from a range  of grass  cutting  experiments  in Teagasc  over 
a large number  of years). The results  show that in a zero nitrogen  situation  grass  
production  was 6.25 tonnes  DM/ha,  increasing  to approximately  9.5 tonnes  at 100kg  
N/ha, 12.0 tonnes  at 200kg  N/ha, 13.0 tonnes  at 250kg  N/ha, 13.8 tonnes  at 300kg  
N/ha, and 14.2 tonnes  at 350kg  N/ha. Marginal  responses  ranged  on average  from 
>30kg  DM/kg  N for N fertiliser  rates less than 100kg N/ha; 20 to 30kg DM/kg  N for N 
fertiliser  rates of 100 to 225kg  N/ha; 10 to 20kg DM/kg  N for N fertiliser  rates of 250 
to 325kg N/ha and less that 10kg DM/kg  N for N fertiliser  rates greater  than 325kg  
N/ha.
Figure  6. Influence  of nitrogen  level on grass  dry matter production
More recent  research  has shown  differences  in background  release  of N from soil 
due to soil type (O'Connell,  et al., 2005). The quantities  of N released  ranged  from 
74kg N /ha on shallow  heavy-textured  and poorly  drained  soils to over 200kg/ha  on 
deep, loamy  soils that were moderately  to well-drained.  The response  to fertiliser  N 
will therefore  depend  on soil type (background  release  of N from the soil).
The cost of the fertilizer nitrogen  relative  to milk price
Figure  7 shows milk nitrogen  (both CAN and urea) price ratio from 1980 to 2006.  
Both in the early 1980's  and similarly  over the last two years the milk nitrogen  price 
ratios are not as favourable  as they were from 1987 to 2002. The unfavourable 
relationship  in the early 1980 ’s was the result  of lower  milk price and a fuel shortage 
over that period. The less unfavourable  relationship  at present  is mainly  due to the 
higher  energy  costs at present. It can be assumed  that this relationship  will not
18
improve  in the near future as energy  costs are predicted  to remain  high and milk 
price remaining  static  at best.
Figure  7. Nitrogen  milk price  ratio
The cost of altemative  feeds  to grazed  grass
Table 7 shows the relative  cost of grazed  grass, grass silage, maize silage and 
concentrate  feeds  on a DM basis (with and without  land costs)  and on a UFL basis at 
land rental  charges  of €250,  €350  and €450/ha.  Grazed  grass  was costed  using  both 
good grassland  management  (stocking  rate of 2.47 cows/ha,  300kg  of concentrate 
fed/cow,  nitrogen  application  rate of 285kg/ha  and a milk output of 500kg milk 
solids/ha)  and the average  of that being achieved  by specialist  dairy farmers  in the 
National  Farm Survey  (NFS) (stocking  rate of 1.90 cows/ha,  700kg  of concentrate 
fed/cow,  nitrogen  application  rate of 170kg/ha  and a milk output of 350kg milk 
solids/ha).  This difference  in efficiency  represents  a difference  of almost  €130/cow  in 
feed costs based on an annual intake/cow  of 3.5 tonnes at a rental charge  of 
€350/ha.
Compared  to grazed  grass on a energy  basis and using a rental charge  of €350/ha, 
first cut silage  was 2.5 times as expensive,  second  cut silage  2.9 times  as expensive  
and concentrates  (at €200/tonne)  3.5 times as expensive.  Maize silage was of 
similar  cost as first cut silage  but less expensive  than second  silage. These  results  
indicate  that on a grazing  platform,  grazed  grass  should  be optimised,  first cut silage  
used as winter  feed, and both concentrate  feed and second  cut silage  should  be kept 
to a minimum.  Maize  silage production  should  not form part of a system  within the 
grazing  platform. In a situation  where the grazing  platform  is not adequate  to 
produce  feed then maize  silage  is the best alternate  based  on Table  7.

The relative  competitive  advantage  of grazed  grass is expected  to improve  over the 
next number of years,  due to high concentrate  price and continued  increasing  cost of 
grass  silage. Reduced  production  of grain around  the world in 2007, combined  with 
strengthening  demand,  is shrinking  global  stocks  and is causing  prices  to increase  to 
the highest  levels in a decade. World wheat prices have climbed  as exportable  
supplies  are down sharply  in key Northern  Hemisphere  regions  such as United  
States, Black Sea region and the European  Union. This tightness  has been  
exacerbated  by a severe  crop shortfall  in Australia  and strong import demand  in 
India. Surging  com prices  are being driven  by a smaller  US crop and strong  demand 
for use in ethanol  and exports.  Barley  prices  have also jumped  to a decade  high as a 
result of sharply  lower exportable  supplies  in Australia  (the largest  exporter  in the 
past 3 years)  as well as strengthening  feed demand  in light of poor wheat  crops. In 
China domestic  demand  continues  to rise as the livestock  and poultry  sectors  are 
experiencing  rapid growth and industrial  use of com is expanding. Greater 
consumption  is largely  due to higher  incomes  and urbanisation.  As a result of this 
strong  growth,  stocks  are forecast to continue  shrinking  while  exports  are expected  to 
remain  at just a quarter of the level of 5-years  ago. The reduced  global  supplies  has 
caused  EU prices  to climb to a 10-year  high and the Commission  has begun  to sell 
intervention  stocks  onto the domestic  market  to curb prices. Attractive  international  
prices have allowed  the commission  to sell large amounts  of intervention  grain for 
export, at prices about $50 above acquisition  costs. This has led to dramatic  
reduction  in intervention  stocks,  particularly  for wheat  and barley. Conserved  feed 
costs (both grass  silage  and maize)  will continue  to increase  relative  to grazed  grass  
due to increases  in contractor  charges  associated  with inflation  in labour,  energy  and 
machinery  costs.
The ability  of the dairy farmer  to use the extra grass DM produced  to increase  milk
output
A number  of studies  were carried  out at Moorepark  from 1978 to 1982 to measure  
milk production  and stock  carrying  capacity  responses  to nitrogen  levels in excess  of 
270kg N/ha. Table 8 summaries  the results  of a three year study (1978 to 1980)  
comparing  two nitrogen  rate (270 and 490kg  N/ha)  at two stocking  rates (2.5 and 3.1 
cows/ha  at 272kg  N/ha; 2.7 and 3.4 cows/ha  at 495kg  N/ha) (McCarthy,  1982). Over  
the three  years  of the trial the response to the  higher  nitrogen  input  was poor in terms  
of increased  milk production.  To claim a response  the milk yield per cow from the 
high nitrogen  groups,  2.5 and 3.4 cows/ha  should  be equal  or greater  than the milk 
yield per cow from the systems  at 272kg N/ha at equivalent  stock densities,  i.e. 
stocking  rates 2.7 and 3.4 cows/ha  respectively.  The response  was greater  at the 
higher  stocking  rate (3.4 cows/ha  versus  2.7 cows/ha).  The results  also show a 
much greater  increase  in milk production  per hectare  from the increased  stocking  
rate than from the increased  nitrogen  input/ha.

Table 9 summarises  a follow on study carried  out over two years (1981 and 1982)  
using an intermediate  level of 390kg/ha  at a stocking  rate of 3.1 cows/ha  (McCarthy,  
1983). At a stocking  rate of 3.1 cows/ha,  increasing  the nitrogen  use from 270 to 
390kg N/ha increased  milk yield per cow by 173kg  and milk output  per hectare  by 
536kg. Using present  day nitrogen  price (80 cent/kg)  and milk price (25 cent/kg)  the 
advantage  to the higher  nitrogen  application  rate would  be €38/ha  (€134-€96).  This 
modest  increase  in profit was achieved  at a stocking  rate that is higher than  what is 
allowed  under the  new nitrate  regulations  (2.9 cows/ha).  This study  also shows  the 
large increase  in milk production/ha  at the higher stocking  rate.

A number  of management  practices  are being  applied  on good  dairy  farms  nowadays  
that will reduce  the nitrogen  requirement  for any given  stocking  rate:
• Greater  use is being made of slurry on dairy farms nowadays.  On many  
Moorepark  farms 3000  to 4000 gallons  of slurry  is being applied  in late March  
on ground  used to produce  first cut silage. This has allowed  for a reduction  in 
nitrogen  application  rates  for first cut silage  by between  30 and 40 kg/ha.
• Better  grazing management  in both spring and autumn by using grass  
budgeting  has allowed  for increased  efficiency  in N usage. This has been  
achieved  by using longer  rotation  lengths  and reduced  requirement  for silage.
• New grass  varieties  are capable  of greater  grass  production  in both spring  and 
autumn  therefore  reducing  the requirement  for nitrogen  at a period  in the year 
of greatest  requirement.

Compliance  with fertilizer regulations  and environmental  implication

Table 11 shows  the average  N, P and K application  rates used in specialist  dairy  
farms  for grazing  from 2001 to 2003. The N usage  at stocking  rates greater  than 2 
LU/ha do not significantly  differ from Teagasc  advice,  while at lower stocking  rates  
the actual N usage is significantly  greater  than the advised  rates (Coulter,  2004).  
Assuming  that the surveyed  farms  had the same  distribution  of soil analysis  levels  as 
the laboratory  samples,  the P usage  on farms  greater  than 2.1 LU/ha  and K usage  on 
all farms  were less than Teagasc  advice. The level of P usage  on farm with stocking  
rates less than 2.1 LU/ha  was in good agreement  with Teagasc  advice. The nitrogen  
and phosphorus  levels allowed  under  the new regulations  are very similar  to that 
being used on specialist  dairy  farms  based  on National  Farm Survey  data (Table  8). 
Similarly  the fertilizer  rates used on monitor  farms in 2005 were also similar  to that 
being  allowed  in S.l. No. 378.

To date, phosphorus  advice  for grassland  has been based  on soil phosphorus  - index  
system:  1 building  up soil phosphorus  reserves  to the target index, and index 2 
maintaining  soil-test phosphorus  at the target index by replacing  off-take of 
phosphorus  in meat and milk (Coulter et el., 2004). Soils in Index 1 are phosphorus- 
deficient,  and require  build-up  of soil phosphorus-reserves.  The optimum  soil-test  
phosphorus  (‘target index')  depends  on farm intensity,  and comesponds  to Index 3 
where  early grass is required  and where  herbage  production  is highly  utilized. Soils
23
in Index 4 have elevated  phosphoais-reserves,  and do not exhibit responses  to 
additional  fertiliser phosphorus.  The S.l. No. 378 phosphorus  advice  for grassland  is 
still based  on a soil phosphorus  index system,  where  the soil phosphorus  range  for 
soil Index 3 have been reduced  from a range of 6..1 to 10 mg/litre,  to 5.1 to 8.0 
mg/litre. However  this change  in soil phosphorus  range (using the best scientific 
data available)  in soil Index 3 will not reduce  animal performance  from intensive 
grassland  farming.
The new nitrogen  fertilizer  recommendations  (S.l. No. 378) are higher  at the lower  
stocking  rates (less than 2 cows/ha)  and lower at the higher  stocking  rates (greater 
than 2.47 cows/ha)  than that currently  recommended  by Teagasc  (Coulter,  2004).  
These  differences  are probably  a reflection  in differences  in background  release  of N 
as a result  of soil type (O’Connell  et a!., 2005). Based  on NFS data and monitor  farm 
data the levels  are similar  to that  outlined  in the S.l. No. 378. The lower  N application 
rates at stocking  rates greater  than 2.47 cows/ha  (210kg organic N/ha) are a 
requirement  for the derogation  to stay within a total N of 500kg/ha.  However  using  
present  day less favourable  milk/nitrogen  price ratio and previous  research  data,  
results  indicated  that a fertiliser  N level of 270kg/ha  can support  a dairy cow stocking  
rate in the range of 2.5 to 3.1 cows per hectare  (Tables  6 and 7). This should  not 
prohibit  dairy  farmers  from operating  efficient  grass  based  systems.
Teagasc  current  research  on increasing  nitrogen  efficiency
• A new project  commenced  in 2006 on improving  the efficiency  of nitrogen 
recovery  from cattle and pig manure  in order to reduce  the requirement  for 
fertiliser  nitrogen. It will focus on improving  the methods  and timing of 
application  and strive to improve  our understanding  of the soil and related  
processes  involved  and the immediate  and residual  availability  of manure  
nitrogen  in grassland  systems.
• A study  will commence  in 2007 at the Dairygold  Research  Farm to investigate 
the effect  of three stocking  rates (2.0, 2.47 and 2.94 cows/ha)  and a range  of 
fertiliser  N application  rates (185 to 325kg N/ha) on nitrogen  leaching  and 
stocking  carrying  capacity  on a free draining  soil. This new research 
programme  will investigate  a range of management  practices  with the 
objective  of increased  nitrogen  efficiency  and reducing  nutrient  losses  to the 
environment.
• The  research  programme  over the last five years at the Solohead  Research  
Farni has demonstrated  the potential  of including  white clover to reduce  
fertiliser  N requirement.  The study has demonstrated  that an established 
white  clover  grass based  system  using 90kg N/ha and stocked  at 2.0 cows/ha 
produced  similar  milk production  per cow as a grass  only sward  stocked  at 2.2 
cows/ha  and using  226 kg N/ha.
Optimum  systems  of milk production  in a low and high stocking  scenario
Prior to the introduction  of milk quotas in Ireland  in the mid-1980 ’s the optimum  
system  of milk production  was based  on spring  calving,  a stocking  rate of 2.5 to 3.0 
cows/ha,  a concentrate  input of 500 to 750kg/cow  and a nitrogen  application  rate of 
270 to 300kg  N/ha (Crosse,  1988). However,  with the introduction  of milk quotas  on
24
dairy farms, the emphasis  shifted from maximising  performance  per hectare  to 
maximising  performance  per kg of milk quota on the farm. In this scenario  where 
land is not limiting  or has a low opportunity  cost it may be justifiable  to allocate  the 
extra land by means  of a lower  stocking  rate to the dairy enterprise  rather  than to an 
alternative  enterprise.  The shift to lower  stocking  rates was further  rewarded  through  
the introduction  of REPS. However  in a future  scenario  in the in the absence  of EU 
milk quotas  and REPS  payment,  dairy  farm profitability  will be maximised  at relatively  
high stocking  rates (2.5 to 2.8 cows/ha)  resulting  in a reduction  in milk output  of 
approximately  10% (McMeekan  and Walsh,  1963).
At present  and into the future it could be envisaged  that two broad  systems  of milk 
production  will develop  in Ireland:
• Rural Environment  Protection  Scheme  (REPS)  based  milk production  system;
• High output per hectare  systems  based on high stocking  rate and grass  
utilisation.
The decision  by dairy farmers  on which system  to opt for over the coming  years  will 
be influenced  by such factors  as the availability  of milk quota,  conditions  applying  to 
REPS 4, compliance  factors  in relation  to obtaining  a derogation  at farm level, the 
availability  of land and the 2008 review  of CAP. The technical  factors  that will be 
important  in maximising  farm profitabiiity  will be very similar for both systems  of milk 
production.
Based on the stocking  rates on REPS systems  of milk production,  there is a 
requirement  to further  reduce  both N and concentrate  fed/cow. Nitrogen  costs can 
be reduced  by relying  on white  clover  to reduce  fertiliser  N requirement.  Concentrate  
input can be reduced  with better grazing  management  and greater  use of grass  
budgeting.
On intensive  grass based  systems  farm profitability  will be maximised  at relatively  
high stocking  rates (2.5 to 2.8 cows/ha)  using a nitrogen  input of 270 to 300kg  N/ha 
and a concentrate  input of iess than 500kg/cow.  The cow type is also important  in 
that it produces  a relatively  high milk yield of high milk constituents;  maintains  a 365 
day calving  interval,  has high survival  traits and is an efficient  converter  of grazed  
grass into milk. A target milk production  will be in the region  of 1200 to 1400kg  of 
milk solids/ha  (fat plus protein).
Conclusion
Very high level of grass DM production  over a long season  is possible  under Irish 
climatic  conditions.  The combination  of the generaily  lower stocking  densities  and 
lower milk solids per cow for Ireland,  results  in Ireiand  having  the lowest  milk solids  
per hectare  compared  with all other countries  with the exception  of France. This 
should  be viewed  as an opportunity  in the future in a more liberalised  milk quota  
regime  to increase  milk production  on dairy farms where presently  milk quota is 
limiting. Specialist  dairy farmers  participating  in REPS scheme  have smaller  milk 
quota  size, achieved  a higher  net margin  per litre but achieved  a lower Family  Farm
25
Income  and net margin  per hectare. The new nitrogen  and phosphorus  fertilizer  
regulations  will not prohibit  dairy farmers  from operating  efficient  grass based milk 
production  systems. In Ireland  pasture  based dairy farming  is and will be in the 
future the most profitable  enterprise  when based on the efficient  conversion  of 
grazed  grass into milk. On intensive  grass based  systems  farm profitability  will be 
maximised  at relatively  high stocking  rates (2.5 to 2.8 cows/ha)  using a nitrogen  input  
of 270 to 300 kg N/ha and a concentrate  input  of less than 500 kg/cow.

Increasing  milk value
Laurence  Shalloo
Teagasc,  Moorepark,  Fenmoy  Co. Cork
Introduction
Dairy  farmer profitability  is comprised  of receipts  for milk and livestock,  less the costs  
associated  with producing  milk. Approximately  90% of the sales from the farm come 
from the sale of milk. The price a farmer  receives  for milk should  be directly  related  
to the yield and value of the milk products  that can be produced,  less the processing  
costs. Milk pricing  systems  are a method  of communication  between  the processor 
and the dairy farmer. Within this communication  the processor  should provide  a 
clear indication  to the farmer  of the type of milk required  and when it should  be 
suprplied. If this communication  is functional,  and dairy farmers  respond  to the 
signals  of the processor,  both the farmer  and the processor  should  gain substantially.  
To this end dairy farmers  should  be rewarded  for milk that increases  the profitability 
of the industry  (farmer  and processor),  while at the same time milk that is reducing  
the profitability  of the industry  (farmer  and processor)  should be penalised.  The 
objective  of this paper  is to examine  the effects  of changing  the milk pricing  systems  
currently  operated  by most milk processors  in Ireland,  to a system  that rewards  dairy 
farmers  for producing  milk that will increase  the profitability  of the industry. The 
paper  analyses  the effect  of two areas  of milk payment:
(1) A+B-C
(2) Ratio  of fat to protein
A+B-C
The A+B-C  system  (Multi  Component  Price System,  MCPS)  of milk payment  is used  
in many  countries  around  the world (e.g. Denmark,  Holland,  Australia,  New Zealand,  
etc.). This system  operates  by putting  a value  on each kg of protein  and fat supplied  
by the farmer  to the processor,  and subtracting  a cost for collection  and processing  
all of the milk supplied. This methodology  is substantially  different  to the system  
currently  operated  by many of the processors  in Ireland. The system  operated  by 
many of the processors  is the differential  milk payment  system  where each 0.1 ®/o 
change  in fat and protein  is rewarded  while there are no processing  costs deducted.  
Therefore,  the increased  milk price achieved  at farm level for increasing  milk solids  is 
less under  the Irish milk payment  systems  when compared  to the systems  operated  
using the A+B-C  systems. When dairy farmers  are not adequately  rewarded  for 
increasing  milk solids they do not put as much emphasis  as they should on 
increasing  milk solids,  this ultimately  results  in increasing  costs to the industry  as a 
whole.
The Irish and New Zealand  dairy industries  are similar  in that most milk is seasonally 
produced,  and is primarily  used for manufacturing  and export. Table 1 shows  the 
average  milk production  and composition  per cow for both Ireland  and New Zealand.  
Average  milk yield per cow in Ireland is approximately  4,649kg,  containing
28
approximately  325kg of milk solids (fat and protein),  while in New Zealand  the 
average  milk yield is 3,942kg,  with 324kg  milk solids. Therefore,  for the Irish dairy  
industry  to process  a similar  level of milk solids  per cow as in New Zealand,  an extra  
700kg of milk carrier  (mostly  water plus lactose)  must be processed.  Based  on a 
processing  cost of 6c/l of milk, it is estimated  that this additional  water  costs the Irish 
dairy industry  (farmer  and processor)  €42/cow  or €50,000,000  annually.  When  the 
dramatic  increases  in energy  and labour  costs observed  over the past number  of 
years (CSO 2007) is included,  it is clear that the processing  and transport  costs of 
milk at processor  level have increased  sharply  in recent  times. As these rates of 
increase  in labour  and energy  costs show no signs of abating,  the costs associated  
with processing  milk in the future will continue  to increase  and the potential  benefit  of 
moving  to a system  that rewards  high solids milk, thereby  reducing  the volume  of 
water  for a given level of product,  will be even more  beneficial.
Table 1. Milk yield, protein  %, fat % and milk solids  yield per cow per year in 
Ireland  and in New  Zeaiand
Milk Yield (kg) Protein  (%) Fat (%) Milk solids  (kg)
Ireland 4,649 3.28 3.71 325
New Zealand 3,942 3.54 4.68 324
The value  of A (kg/protein,  €/kg), B (kg/fat,  €/kg) and C (the costs  to process  a litre of 
milk, €/litre) are specific  to each processor.  They are dependent  on the product  
portfolio  of the processor,  the margin for the products  produced  and the costs  
associated  with processing  one litre of milk. The C component  of the milk payment 
may differ between  processors  for varying  reasons. Berry et a!., (2004)  reviewed  
total milk processing  costs in Ireland  in 2004 and showed  that the average  costs of 
processing  milk were 5.92c/l. In many  cases  the total costs of processing  milk will 
not be included  when  developing  an A+B-C  system;  it will be only the variable  costs  
associated  with the C component  that will be included. The proportion  of the 
processing  cost included  in the milk price has a large effect  on the benefits  gained  or 
not from increasing  milk solids. The larger  the proportion  of the processing  costs  that 
are included  in the pricing systems,  the greater  the benefit  will be realised  from 
increasing  milk solids  at farm level.
Effect  on milk price
A recent  review  of milk payment  systems  in operation  in Ireland  (Kennedy,  2005)  
concluded  that a differential  milk payment  system  (each 0.1% change  in fat and 
protein  in the milk is given a value)  is used by most processors,  with each processor  
having  different  weightings  on the value  of fat and protein.  A second  system  used by 
some processors  involves  the payment  of a flat rate on a portion  of the milk price in 
combination  with a differential  payment  system,  resulting  in a lower  differential  for fat 
and protein  %. The results  of this survey  prompted  a study  comparing  three  systems  
of milk payment  on the average,  highest  10% total solids  and lowest  10% total soUds  
on milk price and overall milk receipts  of a large group of 9,186 suppliers  with
29
496,862,924  gallons  of milk. The two systems  currently  in operation  in Ireland  were 
compared  with the A+B-C  system. The three systems  were set up so that the milk 
receipts  were the same across milk payment  systems  at the average  milk solids  
percentage  of the 9,186 farmers,  therefore  the systems  were price neutral at 
processor  level. The components  of the milk pricing  systems  are shown  below:
1. Differential  pricing  system  where  a 0.1% change  in fat and protein  resulted  in 
0.25C/I  and 0.45c/l  change  in milk price, respectively.
2. Differential  pricing  system  with a constant  where a 0.1% change  in fat and 
protein  resulted  in 0.178c/l  and 0.321c/l  change  in milk price with a constant  of 
7.0C/I.
3. Two  MCPS
(a) 1kg of fat and protein were valued, respectively,  at 310c/kg  and 
559c/kg  with processing  costs  of 5.92c/kg  for milk.
(b) 1kg of fat and protein were valued, respectively,  at 291 c/kg and 
523c/kg  with processing  costs  of 4.0c/kg  for milk.

Table 2 shows  the average  protein  and fat percentage  of the group of suppliers  as 
well as the lowest  10% and highest  10% of total milk solids. The average  of the 
group had a protein  percentage  of 3.32%  and a fat percentage  of 3.81%,  while the 
10% lowest  group  had a protein  content  of 3.18%  and a fat percentage  of 3.59%  and 
the 10% highest solids group had a protein percentage  of 3.47% and a fat 
percentage  of 4.05%. These differences  have a large effect on milk price 
irrespective  of the method  of payment. There is a 2.59c/l, 1.85c/l and a 3.11  c/I 
difference  between  the highest  and lowest  groups  with the differential,  differential 
plus a constant  and the A+B-C  systems  of milk payment,  respectively.  The highest 
milk price  with high total solids  is achieved  with the A+B-C  system,  while at the same  
time the lowest  milk price is achieved  with the A+B-C  system  with the lowest  total 
solids. The differential  milk payment  system  is intermediate  with the differential  plus 
a constant  milk payment  system  paying  the lowest  for high solids milk while at the 
same time paying  the highest  for low solids milk. Therefore,  within  the current  milk 
payment  systems  increasing  total milk solids  is not adequately  being  rewarded  by the 
differential  system  or the differential  plus a constant system.

Effect  on milk receipts
The effect  of an A+B-C  system  of milk payment  on Irish milk producers  milk receipts  
was calculated  using data from 9,186 suppliers  that supplied  over 496,862,924 
gallons  of milk to various  Irish processors  in 2005. The A+B-C system  of milk 
payment  was compared  to the payment  system being used by the processors  
currently.  The ratio of the value of protein  to fat was not altered. The analysis  was 
carried out with two different  C values reflecting  either the inclusion  of total 
processing  costs (5.92 c/I) or the inclusion  of variable  costs only (4.0 c/I). The 
analysis  was carried  out to demonstrate  the effect on each individual  supplier  within 
the group. The suppliers  were then grouped  into categories  based  on the gains or 
losses  that were achieved  at farm level.

The analysis  shows that when the A+B-C systems  with a C value of 4.0c/l is 
compared  to the differential  milk pricing  systems,  91.7%  of suppliers  are within the 
losing  €500 to gaining  €500 category.  Both the losers and those gaining  from the 
system  are spread  evenly. There  are a small number  of people  that lose up to €4000 
and there are a small number  of producers  that gain up to €5000. When  the same  
exercise  is completed  with a C value of 5.92c/l  the variation  between  winners  and 
losers is higher. There are now 82.2%  of producers  in the losing €500 to gaining  
€500 category  less than when the C value was lower. There are also higher
31
numbers  of producers  gaining  and losing  higher  amounts  of money  with the higher  C 
value.

The analysis  shows  that when  the A+B-C  system  with a C value  of 4.0c/l  is compared  
to the differential  plus a constant  milk pricing  system,  61.6%  of suppliers  are within 
the losing €500 to gaining  €500 category.  This compares  to a figure of 91.7%  of 
producers  in this category  when  the differential  system  was compared  to the A+B-C 
system. Again winners  and losers between  the two milk payment  systems  are 
relatively  evenly  spread. However,  the spread  in milk receipts  is substantially  wider  
than when compared  to the differential  system. There are a larger number  of 
suppliers  in the losing and gaining  larger  amounts  of money  than is the case when  
the differential  systems  are compared  to the A+B-C systems. When the same 
exercise  is completed  with a C value of 5.92c/l  the variation  between  winners  and 
losers is again higher,  similar  to when the exercise  is completed  with the differential 
system. There are now 56.3% of producers  in the losing €500 to gaining  €500  
category. There are also higher  numbers  of producers  gaining  and losing larger 
amounts  of money  with the higher  C value.
32
The majority  of the milk payment  systems  in Ireland  currently  operate  through  a 
differential  system.  This analysis  has shown  that the A+B-C  system  of milk payment  
will not have a dramatically  negative  impact  on milk price for a large proportion  of 
suppliers  when  compared  to the differential  milk payment  systems.  When  the A+B-C 
system  of milk payment  is compared  to the differential  plus a constant  system  there  
are larger numbers  of suppliers  gaining  and losing larger amounts  of money  than 
when  compared  to the differential  system.
Ratio  of Protein  to Fat
Within any milk pricing  system  the value of 1kg of protein  and 1kg of fat must be 
related to the market returns that are achievable  from the products  of these  
constituents.  Therefore,  there may be large differences  in the value  of 1kg of protein  
versus 1kg of fat between  processors  based on their product  portfolio. A recent 
study carried  out by Simms  and Thompson  (2006)  showed  that the milk payment 
systems  operated  in Ireland  vary substantially  in relation  to the ratio of fat to protein  
and the value  not attached  to protein  and fat. Table  5 shows  that the value  of a 0.1%  
change  in protein  relative  to fat changes  from 1.1 to 1 in Newmarket  Co-op  to the 
highest  differential  of 2.5 to 1 in Centenary  Thurles  Co-op. The review  carried  out by 
Simms and Thompson  also highlighted  the fact that all except two processors  
(Bandon  Co-op  and Tipperary  Co-op)  had a positive  payment  on volume  within  their 
milk pricing  systems.  This payment  ranged  from a positive  6.8c/l in Lakeland  Dairies  
to a negative  1.9c/l  in Tipperary  Co-op.

The relative  value of protein  to fat has been historically  higher  within the EU when  
compared  to other countries  around  the World (e g. Australia  and New Zealand) 
This is largely  because  in the past there were high levels  of support  for butter within 
the EU, through  intervention,  export  refunds,  etc. However,  this support  for butter  fat 
has reduced  substantially  (-25%) in recent times as a result of the Luxembourg 
Agreement,  and is projected  to reduce  further  if export  refunds  are abolished  as part 
of the World  Trade  Organisation  (WTO)  Agreement.  The current  world market  price  
could possibly  be the best indicator  of where  the value  of protein  will lie relative  to fat 
in the future within Europe  when the support  on fat is reduced. Simms and 
Thompson  2006 (Table 6) compared  the current  EU and world price ratios with 
possible  future  ratios as a result  of the reform  of EU CAP policy  and the reform  of the 
WTO  Agreement.  The results  show that  the ratio of protein  to fat is running  between 
2.6 and 3.0 at world level while within  the EU it is between  1.5 and 1.9. The report 
shows  that if the support  for butter was reduced  by a further  10% the ratio would  be 
2.0 to 1.0, while if it was reduced  a further  25% the ratio would  be 2.7 to 1.0.

The effect of changing  the ratio of milk payment  away from its current  1.8 to 1 was 
calculated  using the same  9,186  suppliers  that supplied  over 496,862,924  gallons  of 
milk in 2005 as was used in the analysis  of the A+B-C  milk payment  systems.  The 
A+B-C  system of milk payment  was compared  to the differential  system  of milk 
payment  to determine  the effect  of changing  the ratio of protein  to fat. A processing  
cost (C) value  of 4.0c/l  (variable  costs  only) was used in this analysis  to compare  the 
different  ratios. There were 3 different  ratios tested based on the Simms and 
Thompson  (2006)  report:
(A) Current  ratio 1.8 tol .0
(B) 35% reduction  in support  for butter  when  compared  to Agenda  2000 resulting  
in a ratio of 2.0 to 1.0
(C) 50% reduction  in support  for butter when  compared  to Agenda  2000 resulting  
in a ratio of 2.7 to 1.0
Table 7 shows  the effect of the ratio of protein  to fat on overall  milk receipts. The 
analysis  shows  there is very little difference  in total milk receipts  when the current 
ratio of 1.8 to 1 is compared  to 2.0 to  1. In both circumstances  there  are over 91 % of 
suppliers  in the category  of losing €500 to gaining  €500 when compared  to the 
differential  systems.  When  the ratio of 2.7 to 1 is imposed  on the milk pricing  system  
there  are more  suppliers  gaining  and losing  more  than €500. However,  there are still 
over 87% of suppliers  within this category,  with those that are gaining  and losing  
more than the €500 spread  evenly  around  the winners  and the losers. This analysis  
suggests  changing  the ratio of protein  to fat from its current  levels of 1.8 to 1.0 to 
either  2.0 to 1.0 or 2.7 to 1.0 will not have a large impact  on total milk receipts  at farm 
level.

Conclusion
The analysis  presented  in this paper  shows  that the milk pricing  systems  currently  in 
operation  in Ireland  are not optimum.  Processors  are not adequately  rewarding  dairy 
farmers  that produce  milk high in fat and protein  constituents  despite  the fact that 
milk with a high solids  content  results  in reduced  processing  costs  for a given level of 
product  production.  High solids milk would  ultimately  result in increased  profitability 
within the dairy industry  for both the farmer  and the processor.  Differential  milk 
payment  systems  pay the same milk price for a certain level of milk solids,  
irrespective  of the volume  of milk supplied. The MCPS system  acts as a double  
edged sword in that it rewards  dairy farmers  for producing  milk with high solids  
content,  while at the same time penalising  farmers  for producing  milk with a low 
solids content. The costs to the dairy industry  to process  the additional  water  
supplied  in Irish milk is and will continue  to rise, resulting  in losses  in excess  of those  
currently  reported  (€50,000,000)  when compared  to the New Zealand  example.  If a 
multiple  component  pricing  system  was introduced  in Ireland,  dairy  farmers  who seek 
to increase  the potential  profitability  of their herds by investing  in breeding  strategies
36
would  see greater benefit  from their investment.  The ratio of protein  to fat is going  to 
widen  from the current  levels  as the support  for butter  in the EU is reduced.  Current  
world  markets  are operating  at 2.6 to 1.0. The analysis  of over  9,000  farmers  shown  
in this paper  suggests  that for a very large number  of farmers  there is going  to be a 
small effect  on overall  milk receipts  when  the milk payment  system  changes  from the 
current  system  to an A+B-C  system,  and when the ratios of fat to protein  change.  
The overall  advantage  to the industry  as a whole in terms of increased  profitability 
through  the removal  of expensive  water  from the system  should  be the over riding  
driver  for change.

What  A+B-C  means  for milk suppliers
Brian Reidy  
Dairy  Farmer,  Sligo
Introduction
After training  with the Farming  Apprenticeship  Board, Brian commenced  a ten and a 
half-year  lease of the family  farm from his father  in February  2001, when he entered  the 
early retirement  scheme. The farm is situated  in South Sligo, on a reasonably  free 
draining  soil, comprising  82 acres around  the parlour  with additional  ground  rented.  
Forty-three  cows produced  60,000  gallons  in an all year round calving  system. Fifty 
percent  of the quota  supplied  liquid milk to Connacht  Gold, Sligo Dairies. Some  calves  
were finished  to beef. Typical  turnout  was March  20, which  was considered  quite good  
for the region. Milk solids averaged  3.3% protein and 3.8% butterfat  respectively.  
Although  A.I. was used, the focus was very much on milk volume,  due in the main to 
high milk prices,  milk price stmcture  and its weightings  on solids,  and the liquid quota.
On commencing  the lease in 2001, the five-year  plan was to increase  cow numbers  to 
60 cows, producing  80,000  gallons. At that time, these plans were considered  to be 
quite adventurous  for the region.
The story  in 2007
Much has happened  in five years, both on the farm and within the dairy industry  as a 
whoie. Consequently  it is important  to be flexible  and be able to adapt to changing  
circumstances.
In 2007 it is intended  that 110 cows will produce  140,000  gallons  milk, 50% of which  is 
liquid, in a low cost grass based  production  system. Target  turnout  is February  1. This 
shouid  be achievable  as turnout  In 2006  was February  6. The plan is to have  +270 days 
at grass. The herd is 70% spring and 30% autumn  calving. Autumn  calving is 
compacted  to 6 weeks  and spring  caiving  to 9 weeks. The breeding  policy  over the last 
six years has been very simpie  and straightforward  - ‘breed  for fertility  and milk solids ’. 
These  strategies  have resulted  in milk solids sold to the co-op  averaging  3.51%  protein  
and 4.04%  butterfat.
Why has the plan changed?
Belief
38
Experience  with the farm apprenticeship  afforded  the opportunity  to visit some of the 
best-run  farms in the country. These  experiences  instilled  the belief that the original  
goals  were attainable.
Challenge
At the time of taking over the farm, it was clear that sound professional  advice  was 
critical to achieving  the targets  set - maintaining  the existing  status quo was not an 
option  if a viable  dairy  farm was to thrive.
Profit
There  are only two ways of increasing  profit  from dairy farming;
Lower  costs
The easiest  and simplest  way to lower costs was to get as much high quality  grazed  
grass into cows as possible. This meant  an early turnout  date (target  February  1), a 
long grazing  season  and a rigorous  re-seeding  policy. The entire farm has been re­
seeded  in the iast six years.
Increase  milk output/milk  price
The only way of increasing  on farm milk price was by producing  high quality  milk with 
good protein  and butterfat  ievels. This is where  the breeding  poiicy  of fertility  and milk 
solids ali tie together. The new pricing system introduced  by Connacht  Goid will 
increase  overall  Milk Price further. Also being  fortunate  enough  to avail of re-structured  
milk quota  was of great  assistance.
What  does  A + B-C  mean  for the individual  farmer?
Simply, the A + B - C system rewards  increased  milk solids and discourages  the 
production  of iow concentration  milk. Therefore  the pricing  system  will pay a premium  to 
those  individuals  who have made  progress  in improving  solids  over  the iast few years.
By improving  milk solids,  the new pricing  system  has increased  returns  by nearly  3c/litre  
over  what  it wouid  have been tf milk solids  and price were maintained  at the 2001 level.

solids  received  in each year  2001-2006
Milk price cent/litre
2001 2002  2003 2004 2005 2006
With the introduction  of the new A + B-C pricing  system,  and the increases  in milk 
solids, profit will increase  by 2.86 cent/litre  on the manufacturing  part of the quota (or 
€8,773  over that achieved  at the old milk solid level and pricing  system).  Of this €1,561  
is down to the new pricing  system. The new pricing  system  lifted milk price on average  
for the year by 0.5c/litre.  This has resulted  in a complete  recovery  of milk price even 
with the reductions  due to the MTR.
The new pricing  system  focuses  on management  and breeding  policy  going  forward.  To 
maximize  revenue  on the farm it is not about  selling  more milk, it is about  selling  more  
milk solids and at higher milk concentrations.  Therefore  both management  and 
breeding  strategy  must be geared  towards  increasing  protein  and butterfat  levels. A 
long-term  target  is to have milk concentration  levels  over 8% selling  close  to 500kg  milk 
solids/ha.
Conclusion
Much has been achieved,  but there is a lot more work to be done. Farming  is changing  
rapidly  and offers  a good future  for those  that are willing  to change.  The new Connacht  
Gold pricing  system  gives clear indications  as to what Co-ops  are looking  for when it 
comes  to milk. To maximize  revenue  it will be necessary  to produce  a quality  product  
that meets  processor  requirements,  which  will ultimately  lead to more money  in farmers  
pockets,  which  as a business  is the desirable  end result.

Profit  from grass  - a farmers ’ perspective

Introduction
Improved  milk yield/cow  by getting  more grazed  grass into the cows has gradually 
increased  milk production  per cow from 1,223 gallons  (5,724 kg/cow)  in 1997 to 
1,357  gallons/cow  (6,351 kg/cow)  supplied  in 2006. At the same  time milk solids/cow 
increased  from 387 kg/cow  in 1997 to 454 kg/cow  in 2006. This represents  an 
increase  of 67 kg of milk solids  per cow over 10 years.
We want compact  breeding  to better take  advantage  of the grazing  season.  In 2005 
we bred for 14 weeks  and in 2006 we  decided  to compact  it even  further and brought  
it back  to 12 and half weeks.
Grazing  days have gradually  increased  from 255 in 1997, rising  to 308 in 2006. This 
is an increase  of 53 days in 10 years.
In 1997 we spread 174 units per acre of bag nitrogen  (217 kg/acre)  versus 148 
units/acre  (185 kg) in 2006. This has been achieved  mostly  by reducing  the amount 
of area cut for grass  silage.
By getting  figures  and targets  I know  when  to close paddocks  in the autumn,  reduce  
meal feeding  and have the confidence  to graze cows earlier  in the spring.  The net 
result  is cows  spend  longer  in the field and less time indoors.
If we add the cost reduction  in meal and fertiliser  (€6,131)  and the increase  in output 
(€6,750)  this gives us a total economic  benefit  of €12,881/year  to the farm.
Snapshot  of the production  system
The farm is run as a partnership,  and comprises  a total of 230 acres  with 126 grazing  
acres  (available  to cows). Cows  are milked  in two parlours.  On the home  farm there  
are a total of 60 grazing  acres and on the leased out farm a total of 66 acres 
available  for grazing. The balance  of the land is divided  into 2 blocks  and grazed  
mostly  by dry cattle  and replacements.
Land quality  is sandy  on the home  farm with slightly  heavier  soils on the out farms.  
In general  land quality  is excellent for growing  grass. Annual  rainfall  is typically  1200  
mm. Good land quality  and adequate  rain mean  the milking  cows can go to grass  as 
soon as they calve  in early February.
In 2002 the farm supplied  76,000  gallons  of owned  quota. In 2007 the intention  is to 
supply  120,000  gallons  (561,600  kg) of milk. The increase  in quota  has come  about 
by (a) setting  the famn up as a registered  father/son  partnership  and (b) the purchase
41
of land with milk quota. In 2004 and 2005  the partnership  provided  the opportunity  to 
purchase  approx  18,400  gallons  of milk. This was followed  in 2006 by the purchase 
of 50 acres  with 25,100  gallons  of milk quota  attached.
The herd is 100%  spring  calving,  starting  to calf at the end of January  and continuing 
until end of April. The duration  of the breeding  season  in 2005 was 14 weeks,  but 
was brought  back to 12 and half weeks  in 2006. In 2005 the home  farm produced 
1,530 gallons  per grazing  acre. With the introduction  of the second  farm into the 
production  system  in 2006, milk quota  fell to 1,250  gallons/acre.  In 2007 at current 
milk quota  the enterprise  is stocked  at 950 gallons/acre.
Ten year performance  review
Figure  1 shows  the milk yield in gallons  from 1997 to 2006. Milk production  per cow 
has gradually  increased  from 1,223 gallons (5,724 kg/cow) in 1997 to 1,357  
gallons/cow  (6,351 kg/cow)  supplied  in 2006. The plan over the past 10 years  was to 
increase  milk yield and milk solids per cow as efficiently  as possible  using grazed  
grass.
The enterprise  has been using Al for the last 20 years. In the late 1990 ’s it was 
mostly  Dairygold  Al sires e g. MALI, MFX, Pigeonwood  Red, CAU etc. In the early  
OO’s a switch  was made  to bulls from the ICBF Active  bull list (based  on EBI), picking  
bulls such as GMI, HRZ, RUUD,  LBO and Hugo.
Figure  1. Milk yield (gallons/cow)  from  1997  to 2006
Figure  2 shows  milk solids (kg) production  per cow for the past 10 years. This has 
gradually  increased  from 387 kg/cow  in 1997 to 454 kg/cow  in 2006. This is an 
increase  of 67kg of milk solids  per cow over 10 years. Protein  percentage  increased  
by 0.20% over the last 10 years, rising from 3.14% in 1997 to 3.35% in 2006 (a 
disappointing  result as it was 3.41%  in 2005!) Fat has also increased  by 0.2% over
42
the 10-year  period  - from 3.63% in 1997 to 3.83% in 2006. This has come as an 
added  bonus  as bull selection  criteria  was always  based  on an increase  in protein.

The number  of days/year  spent  grazing  over the last 10 years is shown  in Figure  3. 
Grazing  days have gradually  increased  from 255 in 1997, rising to 308 in 2006 - an 
increase  of 53 days in 10 years. This has resulted  in significantly  less silage  being  
used e g. in 1997 a total of 90 acres was used for first and second  cut silage  
respectively,  compared  with only 50 acres for first cut silage in 2006. Thus the 
increase  in days at grass has been accompanied  by a reduction  in the amount  of 
grass silage fed to milking  cows. Fertiliser  application  has also been reduced.  In 
1997, 174 units per acre of nitrogen  (217 kg/acre)  was spread  versus  148 units/acre  
(185 kg) in 2006.

Figure 4 shows the meal input per cow from 1997 to 2006. Meal input varied  
depending  on year, ranging  from a high of 835 kg/cow  in 1999  to a low of 515 kg/cow 
in 2004. A drought  in 2006  resulted  in 695 kg/cow  being  fed.
A high protein,  high cost ration  was used in 1997 (costing  circa €198/ton). However 
for the last number  of years  the ration has comprised  a maximum  16% crude  protein  
nut in early lactation,  and then either a 3-way  mix or straight  citrus pulp for the rest of 
lactation.  The average  price per tonne  is now around  €165/tonne.

Focusing  on measuring  and grass  budgeting
In the spring of 2004 the local discussion  group decided  to focus on grass  
measurement  for the year. The driving  force behind  this focus was to be able to 
budget  feed to the cows better, which in turn would have the knock on effect of 
reducing  costs and increasing  farm profit.
The ‘first step' was to start walking  the farm each week (with adviser).  Two weeks 
later a clippers,  scales  and quadrant  was purchased.  This allowed  facilitated  testing 
and training  the eye to different  covers. At this time the farm was mapped  so that the 
exact area of each paddock  was known.  These  then are the essential  tools to grass  
measuring.  After each walk, the data gathered  was entered  into a notebook  or 
computer,  and the average  farm cover  and cover/cow  on the farm was calculated.  
These  figures  were then compared  with targets  discussed  in the media  or the local 
discussion  group. Recording  data eliminates  guessing.
By June the bulk of the paddocks  were  being ‘eyeballed ’, with only a few being  cut to 
keep the eye in tune. Confidence  increased  weekly. In autumn  it was possible  to 
walk the farm without  the clippers  and estimate  the farm cover. The farm walk and 
budget  took approximately  one hour. Today  with the increased  land area, the time 
taken  to do the measurement  and budgeting  has increased  to around  2 hours/week.
44
By having  figures  and setting  targets,  it is possible  to plan when  to close  paddocks  in 
the autumn,  when to reduce  meal feeding,  and have the confidence  to graze cows  
earlier  in the spring. The net result is cows spend  longer  in the field and less time 
indoors.
Results  of measurement
Grass measurement  increases  the days at grass, allows for tighter grazing  and 
provides  information  to leave meal feeding  in or out depending  on growth and 
demand.
A typical  calculation  is shown  below;
• Paddock  1 =1.1 ha and has a cover  of 1800 kg DM/ha. This means  there are 
1989 kg DlWha  in the paddock  for the cows.
• If 90 cows are allocated  20 kg/cow/day,  there is a requirement  of 1,800 kg. 
This means  there is enough  grass in the paddock  for 24 hours, leaving  the 
paddock  fully grazed  out with 200 kg in the field around  dung pads etc.
• If there were 2200 kg in the paddock,  there would be 2420 kg available  for 
grazing  and surplus  grass for the 90 cows. This would require  a further  
grazing  or part thereof  at some  other  stage.
The key clincher  in the 'KNOW  versus  the ‘GUESSSING  GAME ’ is that if you know  
growth  rate is 65 kg/day  and demand  is 62 kg/day,  then you know there is enough  
grass  to meet my demand,  and that supplement  is no longer  required.
Demand = stocking  rate x grass  allowance
= 3.1 cows/ha X 20 kg/cow/day  = 62 kg
Subtracting  the estimate  put on the paddocks  each week, or finding  out the nearest  
growth  rate to the farm can be used to calculate  growth  rate. A particularly  useful  
figure  is the kg of grass  per cow during  the main grazing  season.  A good target  is to 
stay within  the range  of 180 to 200 kg of grass/cow  during  the main grazing  season.  
This means  there won ’t be a grass deficit  or surplus  available  to the herd. In many  
ways this figure is more appropriate  than Average  Farm Cover as it takes into 
account  different  stocking  rates and can be used at discussion  group meetings  to 
compare  between  farms.
The bottom  line
As a member  of the DAIRYMIS  discussion  group,  the costs of production  have been  
recorded  for some time. To see what measuring  grass has done to profit it is 
possible  to compare  the results  of the farm pre and post grass measurement.  These
45
can be considered  in terms of a) cost savings,  and b), increased  income  with higher 
milk output,
a) Savinas  in cost
The cost per litre in meal and fertiliser  can be analysed  for the three years prior to 
grass budgeting  (2001 to 2003)  - Period  1, and post grass  budgeting  (2004  to 2006)  
- Period  2.
1. In Period  1 meal cost averaged  2.54 c/I compared  to 1.67 c/I in Period  2. 
corresponding  cost for fertiliser  averaged  1.64 and 1.32 c/I respectively.The
2. Total  meal and fertiliser  costs averaged  4.18 c/I in Period  1 versus  2.99 c/I in 
Period  2. This is a reduction  of 1.19 c/I between  the two Periods.
3. If the milk produced  in 2006 (515,290  litres) is multiplied  by the above  cost 
reduction,  it equates  to €6,131 /year. 100% of this cost reduction  can be 
attributed  to budgeting  and measuring  grass.
b1 Milk output
Looking  at milk production  statistics  for the same  periods  described  above.
1. Milk yield increased  from 1187 gallons  (5555 kg/cow)  for Period 1 to 1315  
gallons  (6154  kg/cow)  for Period  2.
2. Protein  percentage  increased  from 3.31% in Period 1 to 3.39% in Period  2. 
Fat percentage  increased  from 3.72%  in Period  1 to 3.78%  in Period  2.
3. When  these figures  were input to the Moorepark  model,  the results  suggest 
that the gain in milk sales  was equivalent  to €150 per cow. If 50% of this gain 
is attributable  to getting  more grazed  grass into cows, this means  a further  
€6,750/year increase  in milk sales  when  Period  1 is compared  to Period  2.
Adding  the cost reductions  in meal and fertiliser  (€6131)  and the increase  in output 
(€6750)  gives a total economic  benefit  of €12881/year  to the farm. This financial  gain 
was achieved  by spending  an hour a week  walking,  estimating,  and budgeting  grass 
is on the farm. If it takes an hour and half to walk the farm each week  on average,  
this is a total of 60 hours  in the year, or €215/walk.
Another  way of expressing  this information  is to convert  it to €/cow  or cent per litre. It 
works out at €140/cow  annual  benefit,  or 2.5 cent/litre  on 515,290  litres (2006)  (NB. 
No consideration  is given for a reduced  milk price, savings  in labour, associated 
health  cost savings,  or fixed costs reduction  etc. in these  simple  calculations).
Where  can grass  measurement  and budgeting  impact  further?
• As cow numbers  increase,  the benefits  in terms of profit (reduced  labour  etc) 
become  more  apparent
46
Knowing  there is enough  grass in the system  makes  it much easier  to make  
decisions  on a daily basis.
Research  at Moorepark  and the grass breeding  companies  will be required  to 
supply  grass that has improved  performance  with higher  dry matters  and 
intake  capacity.
There  is a need to be able to select  between  grass  varieties,  to identify  which  
is the best grass for the farm and to be able to predict  grass  growth  easier  in 
the future.
Conclusions
Measurements  are good but need to be accompanied  by budgeting,  i.e. having  
targets  for different  times of the year and being able to compare  where  the farm in 
relation  to the targets and take what action when necessary.  Measuring  and 
budgeting  for one and a half hours  per week  for 40 weeks  of the year = to €215/walk  
into the 'back pocket ’, or €140/cow  or 2.5 cent/litre.  It’s free!

Key Points
• __Profitable  milk production  in Ireland is broadly  based on the provision  of
sufficient  quantities  of high quality  pasture  to produce  quality  milk at lowest 
cost.
• _Spring  grazing  management  must focus on efficient  use of grass  to substitute
grass  silage  and concentrate  from the lactating  cow’s diet. Spring  grazing  has 
a large carryover  effect  on grass  quality  in subsequent  rotations.
• __In spring,  the first rotation  must last until mid-April,  excessive  pasture  damage
must be avoided  and post-grazing  height must be maintained  at 4-5 cm to 
ensure  pasture  quality  is high during  subsequent  rotations.
• __Mid-season  management  must aim to maximise  animal performance  while
maintaining  pasture  quality. High pre-grazing  yields  (>1,800 kg DM/ha)  should 
be avoided. Topping  and silage conservation  should be used as tools to 
correct  poor pasture  quality.
• _Large  differences  exist between  grass cultivars,  choosing  the correct  cultivar
for the system  has a major  effect  on milk output  and profitability of the system.
• _Future  grass breeding  and evaluation  needs  to focus more on characteristics
that influence animal performance  under grazing rather than under  
conservation.
• __Grass measurement  has a large influence  on overall  farm profitability  and is
vital for efficient  grassland  management.
• __Grazing  management  targets are based on the ability of the manager  to
competently  estimate  the amount  of grass on the farm and react to make  
changes  in times  of surplus  or deficits.
Introduction
The Irish dairy industry  will experience  considerable  change  in the years ahead.  
Among  the main catalysts  of change,  reform  of EU agricultural  policy  is anticipated  to 
result in a reduction  in dairy product  prices paid to dairy farmers  (Binfield  et al., 
2003). The challenge  for Irish dairy farmers  is to increase  the competitiveness  of 
their businesses through  increased  scale in the long term, but also through  increased  
innovation  and efficiency  within their current operations.  The production  and 
utilisation  of grass has a central  role in maintaining  the competitiveness  of the Irish 
dairy industry. Economic  analysis  (Shalloo  et al., 2004) shows that maximum 
profitability  within Irish milk production  systems  can only be achieved  through  the 
optimum  management  of pasture  both within the current  quota regime  and within 
future  scenarios  where  additional  quota may become  available  to Irish dairy farmers. 
The ability  of progressive  dairy farmers  to maximise  the performance  of their herds
48
from grazed  grass produced  within the farm gate will be a significant  factor  deciding  
the success  of their  business  in the future.
Dillon et al., (2005)  suggest  that regardless  of country  or quota existence,  a 10% 
increase  in grazed  grass in the feeding  system  will reduce  the cost of milk produced 
by 2.5 cent/litre.  Consequently  one strategy  to lessen  the impact  of reduced  milk 
price is to continue  to increase  the grazed  grass proportion  of the diet. Irish dairy  
farmers  can reap greater  benefits  from improved  pasture  management  compared  to 
our main competitors  through the uptake of better grassland  management 
techniques.
The objective  of this paper  is to discuss;
• The evolution  of best grazing  management  practices  in recent  years
• The  potential  performance  from pasture  based  on research  findings;
• Future  grass  selection  criteria  and strategies;
• Guidelines  and challenges  facing  grassland  production  systems.
Recent  trends  in grassland  management  practice
There have been many changes  to grassland  management  in the past decade.  
Increased  emphasis  is now placed  on technology  to extend  the grazing  season  into 
early spring and late autumn,  to reduce  the requirements  for alternative  higher  cost 
feeds. Early  turnout  (post calving)  is now normal  practise  on many  farms and clear  
benefits  have been observed  (Dillon et al., 2002; Kennedy  et al., 2005). Autumn  
management  has also evolved  with higher  farm grass  covers  built to provide  a grass 
supply  into November,  with some pastures  closed  to store grass over the winter  to 
have herbage  available  for spring  grazing.
The evolution  of management  practice  within Moorepark  since the mid- 1980s is 
summarised  in Table 1. Over  the 22 years, mean calving  date has been delayed, 
and stocking  rate reduced  to facilitate  the incorporation  of a greater  proportion  of 
grazed  grass in the diet of the dairy herd. The current  grazing  season  length is 290 
days, with the main increase  in the number  of grazing  days realised  through  earlier  
spring turnout. The grass growth potential  of the sward has increased,  achieved  
mainly  through  reseeding  of older pasture  and through  the more efficient  use of 
artificial  and organic  fertilizer. There has been a consistent  reductton  in the 
proportion  of second  cut grass silage taken, due in the main to a longer  grazing  
season.
Due to the extension  of the grazing  season  the feed budget  of the dairy cow has also 
changed  - grass allowance  has increased  by 40% coupled  with a 30% decrease  in 
grass silage input, along with a 50% reduction  in concentrate  allowance.  In the 
future we are likely to see a further  increase  in the quantity  of grass in the overall 
feed budget.
In the following  section  the grazing  season  will be broken  down into the spring  and 
main grazing  season. Each of the periods  will be discussed  and the most recent  
grassland  research  results  will be applied  to each section.

Benefit  of early  spring  turnout  to pasture
In the past 4 years a number  of grazing  experiments  were undertaken  in Moorepark 
to quantify the  advantage  of supplying  a larger  proportion  of the diet as grazed  grass 
to the spring  calved  dairy cow in early lactation.
Experiment  1
Over a seven-week  period,  cows on an Early spring grazing  (ESG) system  were  
offered  a daily grass allowance  of 15 kg DM + 3 kg of concentrate,  while cows on an 
indoor  feeding  (IF) system  were offered  a high concentrate  diet of 44% grass  silage 
(8.6 kg DM/cow/day)  and 56% concentrate  (11.1 kg DM/cow/day).  Table 2 shows 
the milk production/composition  and intake  of the two groups  of cows from February 
16 to April 4. There  was no difference  in milk yield (28.3 vs. 27.3 kg/day)  between  
the two systems  but the cows from the ESG system  produced  milk of lower fat 
content  (38.6 vs. 41.6 g/kg) and higher protein  content  (33.6 vs. 30.7 g/kg) compared 
to the cows from the IF system.  The cows in both feeding  systems  achieved  similar  
total DM intakes  (measured  during  the sixth week  of the study)  at approximately  15.5 
kg DM/cow/day;  however  there  were large differences  in the composition  of the diets.  
The cows from the ESG system continued  to maintain  a higher milk protein  
concentration  and higher  grass dry matter  intake  than the cows from the IF system  
into the months  of June and July.
The results  of this study  highlight  the large benefits  (both nutritional  and financial)  of 
Including  grazed  grass in the diet of spring calving  dairy cows in early lactation.
50
When modelled  on a whole farm basis, early grazing  will generate  an increased  
profitability  of €2.70/cow/day  for each extra day at grass, through  higher animal 
performance  and/or  lower  feed cost.

Experiment  2
The objective  of this study  was to establish  the milk production  responses  of spring  
calving dairy cows in early lactation  to daily herbage  allowance  (>4cm) and 
concentrate  supplementation  level. In early February 66  spring  calving  dairy cows in 
early lactation  were randomly  assigned  to six treatment  groups. The treatment  
groups  included  three herbage  allowances  (13, 16, and 19 kg DM/cow/day  >4cm) 
and two concentrate  supplementation  levels (0 and 4 kg DM/cow/day).  The cows  
continued  on treatment from February  21 to May 8.
The 6 treatments  were (on a daily basis):
daily  grass  allowance  (DHA)  13 kg DM/cow  plus 0 kg cone. (LO);
DHA 13 kg DM/cow  plus 4 kg cone.  (L4); 
DHA 16 kg DM/cow  plus 0 kg cone. (MO) 
DHA 16 kg DM/cow  plus 4 kg cone. (M4) 
DHA 19 kg DM/cow  plus 0 kg cone. (HO) 
DHA 19 kg DM/cow  plus 4 kg cone. (H4)
The average  pre-grazing  yield was 1900kg  DM/ha  (>4cm). Mean pre-grazing  sward  
height  was 12.1cm,  while post grazing  sward height  was 3.3, 3.7, 4.0, 4.5, 4.7 and 
5.2cm, for the LO, L4, MO, M4, HO and H4 treatments,  respectively.  The mean  
grazing area allocation  for the low, medium  and high daily grass allowance 
treatments  were (13, 16 and 19 kg DM/ha,  respectively.  These  allowances  equated  
to stocking  rates of 3.0, 2.6 and 2.2 cows/ha,  respectively  during  the first grazing  
rotation.
Herds  offered  both medium  and high levels  of dally grass allowance  (Table  3) had a 
higher  milk yield, protein  yield and bodyweight.  Concentrate  supplementation  had a
51
positive  effect  on milk (28.8 vs. 25.4 kg cow/day),  solids  corrected  milk yield (22.5 vs. 
26.3kg  cow/day),  fat (1022 vs. 1108g/day),  protein  (835 vs. 942g/day)  and lactose 
yield (1222 vs.1418g/day),  lactose  content  (48.3 vs. 49.3g/kg)  and bodyweight  (494 
vs. 501 kg).

During  the early grazing  season  (February  -April)  a balance  must be found  between  
feeding  the cow adequately to  sustain  high animal  performance  and conditioning  the 
sward  for the late spring/summer  grazing  season.  In the first rotation  allocating  a low 
DHA had no effect on animal  production  parameters.  In subsequent  rotations  DHA 
needs to be increased  in line with animal  feed demand,  without  compromising  the 
post grazing residuals. The response  to concentrate  supplementation  in early 
lactation  was high and stimulated  higher  milk production  levels for the remainder  of 
lactation.
Experiment  3
The objective  of this study  was to establish  the milk production  responses  of spring  
calving dairy cows in early lactation  to concentrate  supplementation  and daily  
herbage  allowance.  In early February,  72 spring  calving  dairy cows in early lactation  
were randomly  assigned  to sb< treatment  groups.  The treatment  groups  included  two 
herbage  allowances  (13 and 16 kg DM/cow/day  >4cm) and three concentrate  
supplementation  levels (0, 3 and 6 kg of concentrate  supplementation  daily). The 
cows  continued  on treatment  from February 21 to May 8.
The 6 treatments  were (on a daily basis);
daily grass  allowance  (DHA)  13 kg DM/cow  plus 0 kg cone. (LO);
DHA 13 kg DM/cow  plus 3 kg cone. (L3);
DHA 13 kg DM/cow  plus 6 kg cone. (L6);
DHA 16 kg DM/cow  plus 0 kg cone. (MO);
DHA 16 kg DM/cow  plus 3 kg cone. (M3);
DHA 16 kg DM/cow  plus 6 kg cone. (M6).
The average  pre-grazing  yield was 1300kg  DM/ha  (>4cm). Mean pre-grazing  sward  
height  was 10cm, while post grazing  sward height  was 3.4, 3.7, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4 and 
4.7cm, for the LO, L3, L6, MO, M3 and M6 treatments,  respectively.  The mean  
grazing  area allocation  for the low daily grass allowance  (13.0 kg DM/ha)  and 
medium  daily grass allowance  (16.0 kg DM/ha) groups were 1274 and 1346  
m^/cow/day.
52
Herbage  allowance  had a significant  effect on milk yield, milk protein  yield (P<0.01)  
and milk protein  content  (P<0.05;  Table 4). Concentrate  allowance  increased  milk 
yield, milk protein  yield and milk lactose  yield as well as solids corrected  milk yield 
(P<0.001).  A response  rate of 0.53kg  milk/kg  herbage  offered  was achieved  by the 
HO group. Compared  to other studies  the milk response  rates achieved  in this 
experiment  were low. This may be explained  by the high milk performance  of the LO 
treatment.  The results  from this data suggest that if dairy cows in early lactation  are 
being offered  a large proportion  of good quality  fresh herbage  in the diet, high cow 
performance  can be achieved  by offering  3kg concentrate  DM/cow/day.

Experiment  4
In this experiment  the benefit  of early grazing  in spring on grass DM production,  
sward quality  and milk production  potential  in the late spring early summer  period  
was quantified.  Two swards  were established,  one that was previously  grazed  once  
from February  16 until April 4 {Experiment  1)\ the other had not been grazed  since  
the previous  October/November.  This study commenced  on April 12 and continued 
until July 3 during  which four 21-day  rotations  were completed.  The cows were on 
grass  only for the duration  of the experiment.  Each of the swards  were grazed  at two 
stocking  rates, 5.5 and 4.5 cows/ha  on the early grazed  swards,  and 5.9 and 5.5 
cows/ha  on the late grazed  swards.  The grass intake  and milk production  results  are 
presented  in Table  5.

The cows on the early grazed  swards  at a stocking  rate of 4.5 cows/ha  achieved  the 
highest  yield of milk, fat and protein,  as well as highest  protein  content  and grass  dry 
matter  intake. There was no difference  in animal  performance  between  the cows 
grazing  the early and late grazed  swards  stocked  at 5.5 cows/ha,  even though  the 
early grazed  swards  had already  been grazed  once that spring. The results  of the 
present  study suggest  that swards grazed early in spring have increased  milk 
production  potential,  grass  DM intake  and herbage  utilisation  in early  summer.
Summary
Cows outdoors  from mid February  offered  an 80:20 grazed  grass:concentrate  diet 
produced  similar  milk yield with higher  protein  yield and content  compared  to cows 
offered  a 40:60  grass  silage:concentrate  diet indoors.
• In rotation  1, a daily herbage  allowance  pHA)  of 13 kg DM/cow/day  (with 2 to 
4 kg concentrate  DM supplementation)  allowed high milk production 
performance.
• In a subsequent  experiment  there was no significant  advantage  to increasing 
concentrate  input  to >3kg  concentrate/cow/day  in early lactation.
• From early April, DHA must be increased  in line with herd requirement  to 
achieve  high animal  production  performance  throughout  lactation.
• Early grazed  swards  have similar  grass growth potential  compared  to later 
grazed  swards,  but are capable  of sustaining  higher  milk yields and grass 
intake  in subsequent  grazing  rotations  due to higher  sward  quality.
• 0.8-1  .Ot grass  DM/cow  consumed  from turnout  until the end of the first rotation  
should  be achievable  on ferms practising  early spring  grazing. Grazed  grass 
and concentrate  can be the sole feed with such a system.
• Grass  silage can be removed  from the diet post calving  with this type of 
system.
• When  modelled  on a whole farm basis, early grazing will generate  an 
increased  profitability  of €2.70 per cow/day  for each extra day at grass. This 
is achieved  from higher animal  performance  at lower  feed cost.
• There are beneficial  carryover  effects  on both sward and animal  with early 
spring  grazing.
Main grazing  season  (May  to August)
The objective  over this period is to achieve  high cow performance  from an almost 
exclusive  grass diet. Animals  must be supplied  with adequate  allowances  of high 
quality  pasture  during the breeding  season  to achieve  good conception  rates. In 
general,  grass supply  is not restricted  on farms from late April onwards  with good  
management.  Improvement  of pasture  quality  may therefore  offer potential  to further  
advance  animal  performance  from pasture. Current  research  findings  suggest  that 
for each 1-unit  increase  in OMD,  GDMI  is increased  by 0.20kg. Furthermore  a 1 unit 
OMD increase  will allow an increase  of 0.24kg milk/cow/day.  Many herbage 
allowance  studies  have been undertaken  both at Moorepark  and abroad,  showing 
that increasing  herbage  allowance  above 25kg DM/cow/day  results in only small  
increases  (<0.05kg)  in animal  intake. The aim must be to increase  the quality  of the 
grass  frncreased  leaf  proportion)  allocated  rather  than the quantity  offered.
54
Monitoring  of farm grass cover every 10 to 14 days will assist management  by 
identifying  surpluses  and deficits early, thereby  allowing  quicker  correction  e.g. 
stocking  rates adjusted  or supplements  introduced.  Excessive  topping  during  the 
main grazing  season  should be avoided  as it is very labour intensive  and delays  
pasture  regrowth  by up to four days (on average,  one round of topping  should be 
sufficient  from mid-May  to late June). Where  topping  is carried  out, ensure  that the 
pasture  is topped  to a height  of <6 cm. Swards  mechanically topped  to 6cm in early 
season  support  higher  milk yields (up to 2 kgs/cow/day)  than swards  grazed  to 9cm 
when  subsequently  grazed  at a low stocking  rate. One option  to improve  mid-season 
pasture  quality  on farms is to alternate  paddocks  that are first and second  cut silage,  
grazing  ‘after grass ’ from first cut silage  with the herd and taking  second  cut silage  
from poorer  quality  grazed  paddocks.
One of the main avenues  of producing  milk efficiently  in the mid season  is through 
the use of later maturing  grass  cultivars.  In a four-year study  at Moorepark  (Gowen  
et al., 2003; O’Donovan  et al., 2005), late maturing  cultivars  Portstewart  and 
Millennium  produced  on average  187 kg/cow  (40 gallons/cow)  more milk than their 
intermediate  maturing  counterparts.  Most of this extra production  came  from swards 
which had higher  intake potential,  better  sward  quality  and utilisation  characteristics 
(Table  6). More recent  work at Moorepark  can predict  when a variety  will change 
from vegetative  to reproductive  growth  based  on its maturity  date. This information, 
combined  with appropriate  cultivars  and grazing  management,  can be used to avoid  
major deteriorations  in sward quality. Similar  to previous  recommendations  the 
choice of later maturing  cultivars  would seem the most appropriate  for grazing 
systems  given their initiation  dates (date when cultivars  change  from vegetative  to 
reproductive)  and reduced  re-heading  intensity.

Future  grass  selection  criteria  and strategies
The parameters  which grass breeders  select  on to-day  will determine  the nature  of 
the material  available  for grazing  in future years. Plant testing  has the capability  to 
drive plant breeding  towards  specific  objectives,  by introducing  new test parameters 
or shifting  importance  from one parameter to  another.  Changes  to the methodology 
of assessment  should  continuously  be considered  in view of new research  findings  
and changes  in economic  environment.  With this in view there is a requirement  to
55
now rank grass cultivars  with an economic  evaluation  index. To assign economic 
values to the traits of importance  and let these traits come to the fore in the 
compilation  of a recommended  list.
Animal  Performance  Characteristics
The nutritive  value of hertage  gives an indication  of its potential  value to grazing  
animals,  but its feeding  value (nutritive  value  x intake)  is of most importance.  Grass  
based systems  in the future will be required  to achieve  higher  animal  performance  
from grazed grass over a longer grazing  season. This will result in increased 
importance  in characteristics  such as high DM intake, maintenance  of digestibility  
during  primary growth,  high nitrogen  use efficiency  and high nutritive  valve.
Sward  structure
Sward  stmcture  is an important  quality  aspect  of grass in relation  to DM intake. This 
includes herbage mass, sward surface height, bulk density, tiller density, 
morphological  and botanical  composition  and textural  characteristics  such as shear  
and tensile  strength.  Differences  in sward  structural  characteristics  and subsequent  
animal  performance  between  grass species  are well recognised,  but more recently 
differences  have also been found among  perennial  ryegrass  varieties  (Gately,  1984;  
Gowen  et al., 2003). Gowen  et al., (2003) obtained  higher  DM intake and milk 
production  from late compared  to intermediate  maturing  perennial  ryegrass  cultivars 
when  cows  were  stocked  to allow adequate  feed allowance.  The higher  performance 
with the late maturing  perennial  ryegrass  cultivars  was associated  with a higher  
proportion  of green leaf in the grazed  horizon.  Wade  et al., (1989)  first showed  that 
herbage  availability  increased  when the proportions  of green leaf In the lower  sward 
horizon  was increased.  Peyraud  et al., (2004)  showed  daily allowance  of green leaf 
to be a better predictor  of DM intake than daily herbage  allowance.  In a study 
currently  being carried out at Moorepark,  Melle an old outclassed  variety, out 
performed  all current  newly  bred varieties  in the production  of green  leaf during  the 
main growing  season.  Similarly  Melle  achieved  the lowest  extended  tiller height  and 
pseudostem  height,  which are sward characteristics  that promote  high DM intake.  
The challenge  for the future will be to develop  swards  through  grass breeding  that 
will maintain  high DM intake (high leaf swards)  while at the same time result in low 
residual  sward  height.
Nutritional  factors
Assuming  optimum  herbage  allowance  and management  conditions,  feed intake in 
ruminants  is most likely controlled  by both physical  and physiological  factors.  
Physical  factors include  the cow ’s rumen capacity  for DM or fibre. Physiological  
factors  include  end products  of rumen fermentation  and intestinal  digestion.  It is 
generally  believed  that as energy  density  Increases  and fibre content  decreases, 
physical  factors  pose less constraint  on feed intake  and physiological  factors  become 
more important.  The digestibility  of forages  and mmen  fill are strongly  related  to the 
cell wall content  and lignification  of the cell wall. A perennial  ryegrass  cultivar  with 
lower cell wall content  and higher  water soluble  carbohydrate  (WSC)  content  will 
result  in a higher  digestible  DMI and milk production.
56
Seasonality of DM production
Peak  DM production  in May/June  vyith little emphasis  on early-spring/late-autumn  DM 
production  characterised  systems  of animal  production  based  on a high reguirement 
of conserved  grass  silage. However  in recent  years  with the advent  of earlier  grazing  
in spring and later grazing  in the autumn,  characteristics  such as early spring and 
late autumn  DM production  have become  much more important,  with a reduced  
requirement  for high DM production  in May/June.  The feed budget  in the Moorepark 
blueprint  for efficient  milk production  in the south of Ireland now consists  of 
approximately  75% grazed grass, 20% grass silage and 5% concentrate.  This 
indicates  that characteristics  that are important  for breeding  grass for grazing  are 
much more important  than that for silage production.  High peak DM production  in 
mid-season  may result in sward quality problems,  resulting  in reduced  animal 
performance  i.e. low milk protein  content. This was evident  in recent  years with a 
large Increase  in the use of late maturing  varieties  in preference  to both early- and 
mid-season  maturing  varieties. In 1998/99  late, intermediate  and early maturing  
varieties  comprised  of 65%, 30% and 5% of total sales respectively;  while in 2004/05 
late, intermediate  and early maturing  varieties  comprised  of 80%, 20% and <1% of 
total sales.
Summary
• Grass  yariety  breeding  and testing  has and will continue  to play an important 
role in enhancing the profitability of Irish grassland  farmers.
• Future  grass breeding  and eyaluation  needs  to focus more on characteristics 
that influence  animal  performance  under grazing  rather  than undercutting  and 
conservation.
• Routine  measurement  of mid-season  digestibility  should  be considered  in the 
Irish evaluation  system.
• Sward  stmcture  (height,  tissue partitioning,  degree  of re-heading),  nutritional 
characteristics  (digestibility,  CP, WSC and fibre content)  and seasonal 
productivity  (spring,  summer  and autumn)  are important  traits to  select for.
The Moorepark  pasture  management  system  guidelines
For the purposes  of describing  grassland  measurement  guidelines,  the grazing  
season  can be divided  into three critical  management  periods.
• Autumn/Winter  (August  1 to Housing)
• Spring  - First Rotation  (Turnout  to April 15)
• Main grazing  season  (April  20 to  August  1).
For the purposes  of making  use and putting  into practice  this section  of the paper,  
every  dairy farmer  needs  to walk their grazing  area frequently  (at least weekly)  and 
make an estimate  of the amount  of DM on the farm. This is a skill, and like every  skill 
needs  to be developed  over time. However  the farmers  who have developed  this 
skill are now reaping  the rewards  of sustained  progress  with efficient  grassland  
management  and measurement.  Looking  to the future, the skill of grassland 
measurement  is cmcial  for dairy  farmers  committed  to profitable  futures  in dairying.
57
Autumn/Winter (late August to Decembert
This is the start of the grassland  season.  The aim of this period  is to maximise  the 
amount  of grass utilised  in the period September  to December,  while at the same  
time finish the grazing  season  with the desired  farm grass cover. The decisions 
made on the farm during autumn  will have a major impact  on the success  of the 
farmer  at extending  the grazing  season  into the autumn  as well as increasing  grass 
availability  next spring  and deciding  when  the herd can be turned  out to pasture.  It is 
essential  that a grass budget  be prepared  to set the targets  for the amount  of grass 
that is required  on the farm from August  through  to May of the subsequent  year.
The farm specific  factors  requiring  consideration  when making  such decisions  at this 
time of the year include:  the stocking  rate, grovrth  rates,  calving  pattern  and expected 
length of the grazing  season. As a guide for dairy farmers.  Table 7 illustrates  key 
target grass covets  for a farm stocked  at 2.5 cows/ha,  growing  14.5 tons of grass  
DM/yr,  with a mean calving  date of February  10, and a grazing  season  extending 
from early Febmary  until late November.  The targets  described  are based on the 
entire grazing  area being available  in late autumn  and early spring,  with first cut 
silage  taken  on 40% of the farm on May 25 from silage  ground  closed  since  April 10.

For those  operating  under  different  conditions  (stocking  rates, grovrth  rates, calving  
pattern  and grazing  season  lengths),  it will be necessary  to adjust  the feed budgets 
and target  covers. The realisation  of these  targets  may require  feed supplementation 
in years of poor  growth  or at times  of poor  grazing  conditions.  For those  operating  on 
calving  patterns  that are more spread  out through  February,  March  and April, or at 
lower overall  stocking  rates, an earlier  spring turnout  date than that shown  will be 
achievable.  It will also be possible  at lower stocking  rates to maintain  the herd at 
grass  for a longer period  in autumn.  The objective  of budgeting  grass in this manner  
is to provide  adequate  grass  to the herd, while having  sufficient  grass  to maintain  the 
herd at pasture  late into the autumn.
The following  key objectives should  be used during the Autumn/Winter:
• Rotation  length  should  be increased  from 24 days in mid-August to  40 days in 
mid-September  to build the average  farm cover.
58
• Highest  average  farm cover  should  be achieved  in mkJ to late September  at 
which point a cover  of up to 1400kg  DM/ha  is manageable.  (On wetter  soils 
this target  needs  to be adjusted  downward  based  on the length  of the grazing  
season.)
• The first paddock  stopped  for the spring  should  be closed  on October  15, in 
later regions closing may begin earlier as this will compensate  for lower 
subsequent  autumn  and spring growth. Isolate  some suitable  dry paddocks  
for early  grazing.  Most of the herbage  available  for grazing  next spring  will be 
that grown  once these paddocks  have been closed.
• Each 1-day  delay in closing  from October  10 to December  11 reduces  spring  
herbage  mass by 15 kg DM/ha.
• Aim to have at least 60-65%  of the farm closed  by the end of the first week  of 
November.
• All paddocks  should  be grazed  to a post-grazing  residual  cover  of 200 -300 kg 
DM/ha  during  the last rotation  to encourage winter  tillering.
• Avoid  reducing  the farm cover below 500 kg/ha in autumn  or re-grazing  
pastures  that have been closed.
• Budget  for 5-10 kg of over winter  growth  from the time the farm is completely 
closed  in December once all the above  have been completed.
Spring  (Febmarv  to late Aprih 
The provision  of early  spring  grass:
Closing  date in the autumn,  timing and level of spring nitrogen  are the two most 
important  management  factors  influencing  the supply  of grass  in early spring. Date 
of initial spring  nitrogen  application  will largely  depend  on location  and soil type. On 
free draining  soils in the south of Ireland initial spring nitrogen  application  should  
commence  from mid to late January.  The optimum  date for initial spring  nrtrogen  in 
the central  half of the country  is early/mid-February,  while in the northern  region  will 
be late-Febmary.  A recent  3-year  study  at Moorepark  obtained  a response  of 16 kg 
DM/kg N in eatiy-March  to nitrogen  applied  in mkJ January.  The initial application 
should  be applied  at a rate of 30 kg N^a, with a second  application  of 30 to 50 kg 
N/ha in early March  depending  on grass requirement.  Urea is Just as effective  as 
CAN for early grass,  with the advantage  that it is less prone to leaching  and has a 
lower cost  per unit.
The aim at this time is to achieve  an equilibrium  between  maximising  the amount  of 
grazed  grass in the cows diet while at the same time having  a farm grass cover  of 
>950 kg DM/ha by late April. The management  factors  that will have the largest  
influence  on the quantity  of grazed  grass  consumed/cow  overthis  period  are stocking  
rate, calving pattern,  autumn  closing cover, silage ground  availability  and spring  
nitrogen.  With variable  spring  grass  growth  rate, weekly  monitoring  will be required  
and actions  must be taken quickly  to achieve  targets. Preparing  a budget  to ration  
grass supply  to the dairy herd during the first rotation  will facilitate  early grazing. 
Early grazing  is further  assisted  by grazing  a proportion  of the silage ground  twice  
(immediately  at turnout  and again in early April) before  closing  for silage. During  the 
first rotation,  it is desirable  that paddocks  be grazed out to a target post-grazing 
height  of 4-5cm.
The following  key targets  should  be used during  the spring:
59
• A farm cover  >600 kg DM/ha  in mid January  (with paddocks  ciosed  in rotation  
from mid-October  the previous  autumn).
• A feed budget  (grazing  strategy)  should  be pianned  and updated  regularly  to 
control  grass  demand  (grazing  stocking  rate and daily herbage  allowance)  and 
supply  (farm  cover  and grass  growth) throughout  the spring  period,
• The availabie  grass suppiy  should  be budgeted  with the first grazing  rotation  
finishing  between  the Aprii 10 and 20.
• A target  post-grazing  height  of 4.5 cm ensures  high grass  utilisation.
• Good grazing  management  practises  such as block grazing  and a good fami 
road network  wiii reduce  the risk of soii damage  during  this period.
• Grazing  management  must be flexibie  during  this period;  on/off  grazing  can be 
successfuliy  used as a method  of reducing  soii damage  during periods  of 
excessive  rainfali.
Main Grazing  Season  (May  to Auqus O
The objective  over this period is to achieve  high cow performance  from aimost  a 
complete  grass diet. Animals  must be supplied  with adequate  aliowances  of high 
quaiity  pasture  during  the breeding  season  to achieve  good conception  rates. In 
general,  grass supply  is not restricted  on farms from late April onwards  with good  
management.
Grassland  management guidelines  for this period  are;
• Farm grass cover should be maintained  at 200 to 220 kg DM/cow  on the 
grazing  area during  the main grazing  season.
• Using normal  grass  growth  rates,  a stocking  rate of 4.2 cows/ha  from mid April 
to eariy  June  is sufficient to adequately feed  cows at pasture.
• Pre-grazing  yields should be maintained  at 1400-1800  kg DM/ha  to ensure 
that post grazing  height  targets  are achieved.
• Where  pasture  quality is good, post grazing heights  of 5 to 5.5 cm are 
achievable  without  detriment to animal  performance.
• Pastures  with high post-grazing  residues  (>350 kg DM/ha;  >7.5 cm post­
grazing  height)  should  be topped.
• Avoid  grazing excessively  low pre-grazing  heights, as this will result in 
inadequate  animal  intake  and reduced  animal  performance.
• Use grass  measurements  to identify  grass  surpluses  and deficits.
Where  must  grazing  research  go next?
Grass based systems  in the future will be required  to achieve  higher animal 
performance  from grazed  grass (measured  in terms of milk solids per cow and per 
hectare)  oyer a longer grazing season. This will increase  the importance  of 
characteristics  such as high DM intake, maintenance  of digestibility  during primary  
growth,  high nitrogen  use efficiency and high nutritive  valve.
Animal  production  from grazed  pasture  could be improved  through  increased  use of 
herbage  species or varieties  with increased  intake and digestibility  potential. 
Traditionally  plant breeding  objectives  were mainly  focused  on increasing  DM yield
60
and pest and disease  resistance  with little emphasis  on factors  that effect animal  
performance  and the characteristics  of animal production.  New varieties  are 
described  on the basis of maturity  date, total annual yield, ground  score, spring  
growth  and autumn  growth. However,  three of the above  characteristics  are based  
solely  on DM yield. It is clear  that a more descriptive  recommended  list is required  
by the industry  where  more  definite  measurements  are made.
The ability to avail of the increased  profitability  of pasture^based  systems  may be 
curtailed  by land costs (both rental and purchase).  Access  to land at economically 
feasible  prices  is crucial  to the future  success  of pasture  based  dairy systems.  High 
land prices  reduce  the potential  return  on investment  from our production  systems.  It 
is envisaged  that the cost of conserved  forages  will continue  to increase  due mainly  
to increases  in contractor  charges,  associated  with inflation  in labour,  energy  and 
machinery  costs. The profitability  of supplement  inclusion  will be detemiined  by the 
milk to concentrate  price ratio and the level of additional  milk production  achieved  in 
response  to supplementation.  If the market  value of the additional  milk achieved 
outweighs  the costs of supplement  inclusion  and pasture utilisation  is not 
cornpromised,  higher  supplementation  levels will yield greater  farm profit. However,  
if milk price continues  to decline,  the economic  feasibility  of concentrate  use within  
the dairy feed budget  declines  as the marginal  benefit  of increased  milk output  is 
ouhAreighed  by the cost of the additional  supplementation.
The variability  in sward growth rate is one of the factors  which results  in poor or 
variable  utilisation  of herbage  produced  on-farm,  as farmers  are unable  to manage  
grazing  with precision. By increasing  predictability  of grass growth and animal 
requirement,  feed budgets  can be drawn up with confidence.  Taking  this further,  
decision  support  systems  can be designed,  based  on growth  models,  describing  the 
interaction  between  the herbage  produced  and the animals ’ intake, and used as a 
grazing  management  aid. Long term feed budgeting  will entail  a yearly  feed budget ­
taking cognisance  of total herd feed demand,  the grass production  potential  of the 
farm and also the requirement  for purchased  fertilizer  and concentrate.  The 
development  of reliable  easy to use decision  support  tools will encourage  greater  
reliance  on grazed  grass and greater  connection  between  researchers,  extension  
advisors  and dairy farmers.
Conclusion
There is considerable  scope to improve  animal performance  from grass-based 
systems.  Efficient  exploitation  of grass by grazing  will require  the development  of 
grazing systems designed to maximise daily herbage intake/cow  while  
simultaneously  maintaining  a large quantity  of high quality  pasture  over the grazing  
season.  Grazing  systems  will not be limited  during  the two to three months  of peak  
DM production,  as high animal  performance  from pasture  will supersede  high animal 
performance  per hectare. Daily grass intake will be maximised  by adhering  to 
important  sward  characteristics  such as maintaining  a high proportion  of green leaf 
within  the grazing  horizon  and allocating  an adequate  daily herbage  allowance.  The 
challenge  for the future will be to develop  swards  through  management  and grass  
breeding  that will maintain  high DM intake while at the same time resulting  in low
61
residual  sward height. Likewise  the cow genotype  must be compatible  with the 
system  of miik production.  The development  of reliable  easy  to use decision  support  
toois that facilitate  increased  reliance  on grazed  grass to be used by farmers  and 
extension  services  wili contribute  to optimising  grazing based systems  of milk 
production.

Achieving  less than 3% calf mortality  - a herd health  
perspective
L. O'Grady.  S. More, F.J. Mulligan  and M L. Doherty
School  of Agriculture,  Food  Science  & Veterinary  Medicine,  University  College  Dublin
Introduction
Calf mortality  rates between  1-30  % have been reported  worldwide.  Most recent  Irish 
data show national  average  calf mortality  at approximately  6% (CMMS,  2005), with 
considerable  variation  on individual  farms. The definition  of calf mortality  varies  
between  authors  and may include  abortions  and stillborn  calves. This paper  will focus  
on the concepts  relevant  to the reduction  of mortality  in live-bom  calves. Commonly,  
mortality  is associated  with infectious  disease  such as diarrhoea  and pneumonia.  The 
complete  elimination  of these calf diseases  on farm can rarely be achieved.  However,  
control  of mortality  in live-bom  calves should be a major objective  in all catf rearing  
practices.  A target  of less than 3 - 5% mortality  in live-bom  calves  less than one month  
of age is economically  achievable.
Economic  consequences
The economic  losses associated  with calf mortality  stem from the overall  cost of calf 
disease. Apart from the cost of mortality,  the direct cost of disease  consists  of 
veterinary  treatments  and farmer  time. The indirect  costs are associated  with reduced  
growth  rates and reduced  feed conversion  efficiency.  Impacts  on calf welfare  are also of 
concern  to both the farmer  and the consumer
Prevention  of disease
Preventing  the establishment  of disease  is based  on two key priorities;  maximizing  calf 
immunity  and minimizing  challenge  of infection  to the calves (see Figure 1). Any 
preventive  program  must be carefully  structured  and has several prerequisites  for 
success.
64
Figure  1. The establishment  of calf disease
Reproduced  from Morgan  (1990).
Recording  and Monitorinn
The cornerstone  of any preventive  program  is knowledge  of current and future  
performance.  This is only possible  through  regular  farm recording.  Recording  and
65
monitoring  key data such as calf births, deaths  and disease  episodes  and treatments  
are vital to assessing  on farm performance.
Team  approach
The farmer should maximize  the effectiveness  of consultative  advise by using a 
collective  team, including  their farm advisor  and veterinarian,  drawing  on the various  
expertise  to generate  solutions.
Prevention  methods
Strategies  for the control  and prevention  of calf mortality  can be subdivided  into two 
areas,  generalized  prevention  and problem  specific  control/prevention.
Generalized  prevention
“Generalized  prevention ” is based  on the application  of best farming  practice.  However,  
this is not universally  achievable  on all farms, mainly due to economic  and labour  
constraints.
Maximizing  immunity
Best practice  to prevent  calf mortality  by maximizing  immunity  is focused  on colostrum  
feeding  management,  high quality  stockmanship,  vaccination  regimes,  appropriate  diet 
and mineral  feeding  and general  protocols  to limit concurrent  disease  and stress.
Minimizing  challenge
Best practice  to prevent  calf mortality  by minimizing  challenge  is directed  at reducing  the 
exposure  of calves to potential  sources  of infection. This is achieved  by optimal  
management  of dry cows and the calving  area with respect  to limiting contact  with 
calves. Calf rearing should be performed  to limit mixing of age groups.  
Vaccination/disease  control programs  should be put in place to reduce  the load of 
infective  agents  present  on the farm. A high level of stockmanship  is required  in the 
management  and treatment  of sick calves. Housing  such as calving  pens and calf 
housing should exceed minimum  specifications  for dimensions,  management  and 
hygiene.  Isolation  pens should  also be available.
Problem-specific  control/prevention
Problem-specific  control/prevention  is based on a structured  plan to address  an 
individual  farm specific  problem,  such as neonatal  diarrhoea.  It is based on a clear  
understanding  of the relevant  risk factors  at play on an individual  farm. In order to 
achieve  this understanding  a careful epidemiological  investigation  of the problem  is 
needed. Having  an accurate  understanding  of the mechanics  of the disease  on an 
individual  farm allows identification  of key risk factors  and formulation  of economical  
control  strategies.
66
Investigation
The aim of a problem  investigation  is to establish  the way disease  functions  on the farm.  
This is achieved  by exploring  and understanding  the risk areas for the source and 
spread  of infections  (Table 1). Clues to the important  risk factors  are found through  
analysis  of disease  patterns  using a combination  of disease  records  and clinical  history.
Table  1. Risk  factors  for the source  and spread  of infection
Risk factors  for sources  of infection Risk factors  for spread  of infection
Environment Immune  status
Calves Infective  load
Cows
Further  investigation  such as diagnostic  testing  should  be used to confirm  the relevance  
of various  risk factors,  e.g. measuring  the immune  status in calves 1-2 days old to 
assess  colostrum  management  and passive  transfer. The identification  of the causal  
pathogen  or pathogens  in a specific  farm problem  is often desired,  especially  if a 
vaccination  regime is being considered.  Care should be given to sample  relevant  
groups  and enough  samples  should  be taken to be representative  of the group size 
involved. Often there is benefit  in sampling  affected  and unaffected  animals  within a 
group  to allow comparisons  of significance.
Regarding  targeting  of farm specific  pathogens,  careful thought  should be given to 
vaccination  strategies.  While the aim is to maximise  immunity  and to reduce  disease  
load on farm, certain  management  strategies  to msximise  the benefits  of vaccination  
such as pooling  of colostrum  may have some potential  detrimental  effects  e.g. Johnes  
Disease.
Conclusion
Achieving  less than 3% calf mortality  should  be a realistic  goal for calf rearing  operations.  
Controlling  disease  is the key to reducing  overall  mortality  and economic  catf rearing.  
Preventative  strategies  that do not encompass  the farm specific  circumstances  are 
unlikely  to succeed. An integrated  herd health approach  allows the application  of 
relevant  economic  controls  and clear  mechanisms  for monitoring  their performance.

The nitrate  directive  - getting  more  out of slurry
Stan Lalor
Teagasc  Johnstown  Castle  Wexford
Introduction
Nutrient  management  and fertiliser  planning  are receiving  much attention  at present  due 
to the implementation  of the Nitrates  Directive  in Ireland  through  SI 378 of 2006 (Anon,  
2006). The regulations  within  this legislation,  and the requirements  of cross  compliance  
for the single  farm payment  scheme,  are making  farmers  more aware  of the need for 
more precise  planning  and utilisation  of all fertilisers,  both chemical  and organic.
In addition  to the legal requirements  of the nitrates  directive,  the economics  of farming  
are continuing  to emphasize  the importance  of maximising  the return from each input.  
Fertiliser  costs are no exception.  For example,  nitrogen  (N) fertiliser  purchased  as 
calcium  ammonium  nitrate  (CAN) increased  from a cost of €0.56 per kg N in 1995 to 
€0.82  per kg N in 2006 (CSO,  2007). This equates  to a cost increase  over  the period  of 
46%.
In addition  to increasing  costs, the usage of conventional  chemical  fertilisers  in the 
future  will also be restricted  by their availability.  This is of particular  concern  in the case 
of phosphorus  (P), as the world reserves  of P are limited  in supply  (Stewart  et al., 2005).
As the usage of chemical  fertiliser  comes under scrutiny regarding  maximum  
allowances,  availability,  and cost, the requirement  to maximise  all available  sources  of 
nutrients  on the farm is increasing.  The management  of slurry  application  to grassland  
is vital in achieving  this. While  the fertilisation  potential  of cattle slurry  has always  been  
accepted,  the regulations  now encourage  farmers  to maximise  both the recovery  and 
the distribution  of the nutrients  present. This paper  outlines  how slurry can be used to 
achieve  this.
The nKrates  directive
The nitrates  directive  has had a major  impact  on slurry  management  in terms  of storage  
capacity  and spreading  dates. It also requires  that account  be taken of the fertilisation  
potential  of the nutrients  contained  in it. It does this by specifying  “maximum  fertilisation  
rates ” for N and P. The maximum  permitted  rates quoted in the regulation  do not 
correspond  directly  with chemical  fertiliser  rates, as they must be reduced  in order to 
account  for the N and P fertiliser  potential  of the slurry  produced  on the farm. (Maximum  
permitted  rates of P must  also be adjusted  to account  for P In concentrate  feeds  used)
69
Availability  of nutrients  in slurry
The fertiliser  potential  of slurry  is calculated  based  on the percentage  of the total nutrient  
content  of the slurry  that is deemed  to be “available ” for plant  uptake. Table  1 shows  the 
assumed  N & P availability  from cattle  slurry  as specified  in the regulation.
Table  1. Nutrient  availability  from cattle  slurry
N Availability  % P  Availability  %
2007 2008 -> 2009 2010^? 2007 ^
30% 35% 40% 100 %
from SI 378 of 2006
The P contained  in cattle slurry Is deemed  to be 100% available  to the crop in the year 
of application.  This closely  corresponds  to current  Teagasc  advice. However,  N is 
complicated  by the fact that not ali the N in slurry  is available  for plant  uptake.
Nitogen  availability  in 2007 is assumed  to be 30%, so a farmer  must reduce  the amount  
of fertiliser  N that can be used by 30% of the total N contained  in slurry. This assumed  
N recovery  will increase  to 35% in 2008 and 2009, and increase  further  to 40% from 
2010 onwards.
Since  the total fertiliser  allowance  is fixed for the same period,  this assumed  increase  in 
slurry N efficiency  means  that the chemical  fertiliser  N allowance  will be reduced  over 
time. The reduction  in any year will depend  on the quantity  of slurry produced.  This is 
determined  by stocking  rate and storage  period.
Table  2 shows  the reduction  in fertiliser  N required  for a farm with a stocking  rate of 170 
kg Organic  N/ha (2 dairy cows per ha) with a slurry  storage  requirement  of 16 weeks.
Table  2. Effect  of N availability  % on maximum  chemical  N fertilizer
Maximum  N allowed  (kg/ha) 2007 2008  2009 2010 ?

Chemical  Fertiliser  N 210 208 205
Assumptions:  Stocking  Rate = 170kg  Org N/ha; Storage  Period  = 16 weeks
From table 2, it is clear that the fertiliser  allowance  would  fall from 210kg/ha  in 2007 to 
205kg/ha  in 2010. This reduction  on a 50ha farm would correspond  to a decrease  in 
fertiliser  N on the farm of 250kg  - almost  equivalent  to 1 ton of CAN (27.5%  N) fertiliser.
70
So farmers  will have to manage  slurry in a manner  that maximises  the recovery  of N, in 
order  to compensate  for the reduced  fertiliser  N input.
For farms  that may not need to apply  the maximum  amount  of chemical  N allowed  under  
the regulations,  there  is still a cost benefit  in maximising  slurry  N utilisation.
Maximising  N recovery  from cattie  siurry  on grassiand
N content  of cattle slurry
Of the total N contained  in slurry,  approximately  50% is in the form of ammonium  (NH 4*), 
derived  mainly  from the urine, and is available  for plant uptake. However,  ammonium  
can be also lost to the air. Losses  are highest  in warni, dry weather. The remaining  
50% is mainly  derived  from the faeces,  and is tied up in organic  compounds  such as 
undigested  feed residues  and gut microbes  present  in the siurry. This N is not readily  
available  for plant uptake,  and requires  soil nutrient  cycling  processes  to convert  it into 
an available  form.
Maximisino  recovery  of slurry  N
Minimising  the losses of ammonia  to the air maximises  the fertiliser  value. The dry 
matter  content  of the slurry  will affect  the ammonia  losses. Slurries  with lower  dry matter  
contain  more water, and infiltrate  the soil quicker. This reduces  the time during  which  
the slurry is exposed  to the drying  effects  of the air. Research  from Denmark  and the 
UK (see figure  1) has shown  that a 1% increase  in slurry  dry matter  content  results  in an 
increase  in the ammonia  losses by between  5 and 8% (Smith  and Chambers,  1995;  
Smith et al., 2000; Sommer  and Olesen,  1991). However,  having lower dry matter  
slurries  by way of adding  water will increase  the slurry storage  requirements  for the 
farm.
Figure 1. Loss of ammonia  to air foiiowing  surface  broadcast  (spiashpiate)  
appiication  of siurry  reiated  to siurry  dry matter  content
71
Timing  slurry applications  to days when the weather  conditions  are overcast  or during  
mist or very light rain can also help reduce  ammonia  losses  to the air. However,  slurry  
should  not be applied  when heavy  rain is forecast  within 48 hours in order  to avoid the 
risk of surface  run-off.
Since losses are highest  in warmer  and drier conditions,  applications  in the summer  
after harvesting  silage will give rise to higher losses to the air than in springtime.  
Current  Teagasc  advice  considers  N in slurry  to be 25% available  with spring  application  
(i.e. March/April),  but only 5% available  in summer  (i.e. June/July)  (Coulter,  2004).  
Therefore,  applying  as much slurry  as possible  in the spring-time  is essential  to achieve  
the N availabilities  of 30-40%  as laid down in the regulations.
By switching  application  date from summer  to spring,  considerable  savings  can be made  
in temns  of the additional  fertiliser  required  on the farm. Table  3 shows  that a farmer  can 
save 22kg/ha  of fertiliser  N by applying  slurry  at a rate of 22 t/ha (2000  gallons  per acre)  
in the spring  rather  than in the summer.  If fertiliser  is costing  €0.82  per kg N, this would  
result  in a potential  saving  of €18 per hectare.

Spring  application  of slurry
Applying  slurry in the summer  onto silage stubble  is a common  practice  as soils are 
often more suitable  for trafficking  at this time of year than in spring, and risks of 
contamination  affecting  subsequent  grazing  or silage  quality  are low. While  this system  
is easy to manage,  it results  in very poor utilisation  of slurry N due to high N losses  to 
air.
Spring  application  is more complicated  as grass covers  can be high, and opportunities  
to apply slurry are confined  to periods  immediately  after grazing. This creates  two 
problems.  Firstly,  rotational  grazing  results  in an uneven  sward  cover  across  the whole  
farm, resulting  in a small area at any one time being suitable  for slurry  application  using  
the conventional  spiashpiate.  Secondly,  the soil conditions  during  this narrow  spreading  
window  may not be suitable  for machinery.  Therefore,  the spiashpiate  system  is often  
limited  for spring  application.
72
Alternative  application  methods
There  are a number  of alternative  slurry application  systems  available.  The alternative  
application  systems  (band-spreader,  trailing shoe and injection)  are known as 'low 
emission ’ spreading  techniques.  All three systems  consist  of a boom attached  to the 
back of a tanker  on which a number  of hoses distribute  slurry to the soil surface  in 
narrow  lines. Slurry  is fed to the hoses  via a rotary  distribution  manifold,  which  controls  
the flow of slurry  evenly  to each hose outlet. Blockages  in the pipe-work  are minimised  
by having  a slurry chopping  capability  built into the system. The application  of slurry in 
lines results  in a reduced  surface  area of slurry  being  exposed  to the sun and wind. The 
potential  loss of odour  and ammonia  to the air is reduced  as a result.
The difference  between  each system  is in the manner  that the lines of slurry are laid 
down. The band-spreader  deposits  slurry on top of the grass  canopy,  thereby  reducing  
but not eliminating  grass  contamination.  The trailing  shoe applies  the slurry  via a series  
of “shoe ” coulters  that deposit  the slurry  above  the soil but below  the sward. The effect  
of the “shoe ” is to separate  the grass  canopy,  thereby  minimising  sward  contamination.  
However,  where  slurry is being applied  to low grass covers,  such as silage stubble,  the 
trailing shoe and the band-spreader  will produce  the same application  effect. The 
injection  system  deposits  the slurry into the soil. This minimises  grass contamination,  
but may cause  sward damage  and disturbance,  particularly  in stony soils. The power  
required  to pull an Injection  system  is also higher. The trailing  shoe system  is viewed  as 
having  the most potential  as an alternative  application  system  under  Irish conditions.
One main advantage  that all these systems  have over the splashplate  is that the 
reduced  ammonia  losses  from applying  slurry in lines should  mean  that there Is more of 
the N available  for crop uptake. This difference  is currently  being investigated  at 
Teagasc,  Johnstown  Castle  (Lalor  and Schulte,  2007). The trailing  shoe offers  a further  
advantage,  as by applying  the slurry below  the grass canopy,  grass contamination  and 
subsequent  ill-effects  on grazing  preference  and silage  quality  are minimised  (Laws  and 
Pain, 2002). This means  that slurry can be applied  to heavier  swards  with the trailing  
shoe, thereby increasing  'he window of opportunity  for application  in spring, as 
application  opportunities  are no longer  restricted  to times when grass covers  are low 
and soil conditions  are dry enough  for machinery  traffic. Applications  can be delayed  if 
conditions  are unsuitable  and applied  later, when the soil is drier, to heavier  grass  
covers without  contaminating  the sward. This will result in an extended  window  of 
opportunity  for application  in spring,  thus facilitating  more efficient  N utilisation.
The role of slurry  In P recycling
Many farms feeding  high levels of concentrate  feed inputs now find that very low, or 
zero, rates of chemical  P fertiliser  are allowed  on the farm under  the nitrates  regulations.  
In this case, while the whole  farm requirement  of P will be met by the P imported  in the 
concentrate  feeds,  the distribution  of this P around  the farm will be difficult  to manage.  
The result of this will be that the organic  manure  produced  on the farm will be the only
73
source  of P fertiliser  that can be managed,  as the P deposited  by grazing  animals  is 
uncontrollable.  In this event,  farmers  will need to return slurry  to the areas of the farm 
with the lowest soil P levels. Since these areas may not coincide  with those that 
traditionally  received  slurry (silage fields for example),  the management  of slurry  
application  on the farm may need  to be adjusted.  This may be particularly  difficult  where  
slurry  needs  to be applied  to grazed  pastures.  In this situation,  the trailing  shoe may be 
an option  as it would allow greater  flexibility  for slurry application  to pasture,  since the 
grazing  rejection  would be minimised  and siurry could be applied  after grazing  without 
affecting  grass utilisation  in the subsequent  grazing.
Potassium  and the Nitrates  Directive
The nitrates  directive  does not affect  the usage  of fertiliser  potassium  (K). Since  a lot of 
fertiliser  K is applied  as compound  fertilisers  that include  P, it is important  to ensure  that 
a reduced  P fertiliser  usage does not result in the neglect  of grass K requirements.  
Table  4 shows  the K requirement  of drystock  grazing  systems  and first cut silage. While  
fertiliser  planning  for the nitrates  directive  includes  only N and P, attention  should  also 
be given to requirements  for K. This is particularly  important  where  slurry application  
pattern  is altered,  as cattle  slurry  is a very good source  of K.

Conclusions
The Nitrates  Directive  is forcing  farmers  to take account  of the available  N content  of 
slurry. The proportion  of the N that is considered  to be available  shall increase  from 
30% in 2007  to 40% in 2010. Farmers  must  therefore  improve  the utilisation  of slurry  N.
The key to achieving  high slurry N utilisation  is to apply at a time when crop growth  and 
N uptake  are high, and when losses  of ammonia  to the air are low. Spring  (March/April)  
is generally  the best time of the year  to achieve  this.
Spring application  should be a priority  wherever  possible,  irrespective  of application  
method.  The splashplate  application  system  is a cost effective  means  of applying  slurry,  
and good slurry N utilisation  can be achieved  with this method  when  conditions  such as 
spring application,  weather  conditions  that are overcast  or misty, and low slurry dry 
matter  content  are met. However,  the splashplate  system  may be limited  where  dry soil 
conditions  do not coincide  with low grass  cover. The trailing  shoe system  applies  slurry  
with minimal  contamination,  thereby  allowing  application  to taller covers. This facilitates  
more flexible management  as application  can be delayed  until soil conditions  are 
suitable. This more flexible  management  may prove particularly  useful where slurry  
distribution  across  the farm in order  to maximise  P utiiisation  is a priority.
While  the nitrates  directive  regulates  the usage  of N and P fertilisers,  farmers  still need 
to consider  the requirements  of grassland  for fertiliser  K.

Feeding  and management  for easier-care  systems
John Martin
Greyabbey,  Newtownards,  Co. Down
Background
Located  on the Ards Peninsula  30 km south of Belfast,  the farm comprises  195 acres  
(160 owned  and a further  35 rented). Land is free draining,  with mainly loam soils.  
Historically  rainfall  averages  28-30  inches,  although  this may be changing.  Currently  the 
farm enterprises  consist  of 20 suckler  cows,  430 breeding  ewes plus 120 ewe lambs,  25 
acres of spring  barley  and 40 acres of short rotation  coppiced  willow  for the production  
of biomass.
Suckler  cows were reduced  from 60 in the spring of 2006 with sheep increased  to 
current  numbers.  The change  was based  on benchmarking  results  that showed  up the 
cost of keeping  suckler  cows post decoupling.
Sheep  management
Sheep  were first housed  on the farm in the early 1980's,  as was the fashion  at that time 
to improve  the working  conditions  for both man and beast. Having  built a new silo and 
slatted  cattle accommodation,  the old silo and adjoining  shed was converted  to provide  
removable  penning  for 240 ewes. The main benefit of housing  the sheep was to 
increase  the winter carrying  capacity  and allow for an increase  in sheep numbers.  
However  as we now all know,  there  are additional  costs of indoor  wintering:  -
• Provision  of shelter  itself
• Bedding  costs
• Need  for conserved  forage
• Labour  for feeding  and bedding
By removing  the ewe from her natural environment,  and the use of more extreme  
terminal  breeds, the need to intervene  at lambing  time has increased  significantly.  
Irideed  it could be argued  that flock owners  have been selecting  for increased  lambing  
difficulty  for over 30 years, thereby  placing  greater  demands  on labour  requirement  at 
this busy time.
Mid-march  lambing  ewes are typically  housed  around New Year as ‘early lambers ’ 
moved  out of the main shed. Initially  they are fed a silage  only diet with access  to dry 
minerals. The aim has been to make the best possible  grass silage, with minimum  
waste. Typical  first cut silage  analysis  is shown  in Table  1.

Traditionally  two cuts of silage  were taken,  the first around  May 20 (a high quality  cut for 
ewes),  and the second  in July or August (depending  on drought  conditions)  as a bulk cut 
for suckler  cows. With fewer cattle on the farm, the aim is to take one larger  cut in May 
to provide  all the silage needed. This removes  the labour  requirement  to open and 
close the silo for the second  cut, although  replacing  hundreds  of tyres with a woven  
cover  and sand bags has helped  reduce  labour  associated  with this task.
A single cut system  reduces  the cost per tonne  of silage made, as the first cut yield is 
considerably  greater  than subsequent  cuts. AddKional  savings  come from reduced  
fertiliser  use for the remainder  of the grazing  season. Round  bales (xSO) are made to 
buffer  feed cows and calves  in the autumn,  again  to reduce  cost and labour.
Building  layout  has been adapted  to provide  better  access  for the handler  to place  silage  
in front of ewes,  with the option  to use a feeder  wagon  in the future. Individual  lambing  
pens have been added  with expanded  metal  to replace  straw bedding.  The preference  
would  be to have  all ewes on expanded  metal but cost is currently  prohibitive.  However,  
conversion  of part of the slatted cattle shed will be completed  next year, which will 
achieve  part of this target.
A switch to big square bales of straw 5 years ago greatly reduced  the labour  
requirement  around  harvest,  and all bale handling  is now carried  out as a sitting down  
operation.  Round  bales  were  too difficult  to split for sheep  housed  in pens, but the move  
to 1 X 1 X 2.5 m square  bales has made  splitting  possible.  The bale is mechanically  set 
onto a home built trolley,  which can then be moved  easily up and down the house  for 
bedding. Replacing  small bales of hay with big square  bale haylage,  has again eased  
the labour  requirement  and any surplus  can be sold locally  for horses.
Depending  on siiage  quality,  concentrate  feeding  for sheep  is introduced  about  3 weeks  
prior to lambing. The home-mixed  ration is based  on rolled barley  and a 36% protein  
purchased  balancer  pellet with additional  soya and sugar beet pulp shreds. A small  
amount  of molasses  is added  to reduce  dust.
78
Concentrate  is introduced  at a iow rate and increased,  so twin-bearing  ewes are on full 
ration  of 0.5 kg per day a week before  lambing.  Meal is split over morning  and evening  
feeds.
In an effort to reduce  the labour  required  for feeding  housed  ewes, the farm became  
involved  with a trial organised  by AFBI, Hillsborough  to examine  the potential  of 
replacing  a silage and concentrate  diet with concentrate  augmented  by good quality  
barley straw. This was part of a larger overall programme  funded by DARD and 
AgriSearch  looking  at key breeding  and management  options  for easier-care  systems.
Ewes  settled  quickly  onto the new diet and were more inclined  to remain  silent  and lying 
down when someone  went into the house. The results  of the trial, outlined  in Table  2, 
showed  that ewes fed high concentrate  diets performed  equally  as well as those  on the 
normal  silage  plus concentrates  regime. However,  by taking  silage  out of the system  a 
considerable  saving  on labour  was realised  - especially  around  lambing  time.

Outdoor  lambing
Since 1999 a proportion  of the flock has lambed  outdoors  under  various  treatments  for 
research  purposes. Having lambed all ewes indoors  for twenty years, this was a 
daunting  prospect,  but the ewes quickly  adapted  to the new system. As experience  of 
the system  increased  so has confidence,  with body condition  score better  matched  to 
grass  cover. Sheep  are housed  at the normal  time on a silage  diet and turned  out onto 
grass from two to six weeks  before  lambing,  depending  on weather  conditions.  A low 
grass cover  of 1600 kg DM/ha  is sufficient.  Regardless  of the length  of time at grass,  
there is a consistent  increase  in birth weight  and lamb viability. This system  greatly  
reduces  the labour  requirement  and also provides  savings  in feeding  and bedding.  A lot 
of time is spent moving  freshly  lambed  sheep around  indoors  which again is greatly  
reduced  outside,  particularly  with the use of a quad and trailer.
For the past two years the entire flock has been perfonmance-recorded  using the
79
Hillsborough  Management  Recording  Scheme.  This involves  keeping  simple  records  at 
lambing  (lambing  difficulties,  birth weight,  lamb viability,  etc) and at weaning  which are 
used to generate  an index for every ewe. Ewes that lamb down without  any problems  
and rear the heaviest  lambs  to weaning  achieve  the highest  indexes,  and vice versa. In 
2006 this information  was used to select the outdoor lambing ewes for trial. 
Replacement  females  were also selected  on the basis of their dam’s index, and the 
intention  is to continue  this process  in 2007. Hopefully  it should  result in a flock of 
easier  managed  ewes in the future.
In 2006 about 120 non-trial  ewes were selected  to lamb outdoors,  ensuring  they had 
previous  lambing  experience,  were in reasonable  body condition  and scanned  for twins.  
The preference  is to lamb singles  outdoors  and multiples  indoors  as they usually  need to 
be brought  in anyway  for fostering.  However  multiple  bearing  ewes have been turned  
out to grass during  the day in late pregnancy,  and housed  at night. This management  
again  helped  to reduce  labour  needs  of the flock.
Other  Management  Issues
It is possible  to get assistance  at lambing  time from veterinary  students,  however  all of 
the other tasks that need to be completed  during the rest of the year must also be 
considered  for easier-care  systems. Most of these result  from the fact that sheep  are 
covered  with wool, whether  shearing,  dipping,  treatment  for external  parasites  or dirty 
back ends leading  to fly strike. Perhaps  this is a major  focus for the future, to have 
sheep re-upholstered  in leather. Selection  for resistance  to internal worms and 
dagginess  may go some  way to solving  these  time consuming  problems.
Experience  of on-farm  faecal  egg counting  as an aid to management  has been mixed. It 
is useful to identify  the presence  of nematodirus  and coccidiosis,  but differentiation  
between  strongyles  and strongyloides  has proved  difficult. Preference  is to collect  dung  
samples  which are immediately  sent to the AFBI's Veterinary  Science  Division  for 
professional  analysis,  and the results  returned  by email  within  24 hours.
The use of footrot vaccine  with an annual booster  given at housing  minimises  foot 
problems  associated  with straw  bedding.
Modem  technology,  although  with a financial  cost, offers further  opportunity  to reduce  
labour  in handling  systems. Electronic  ear tagging,  coupled  with automatic  readers  in 
weigh crushes and mechanical  drafting can provide better data recording  and 
subsequently  management  with less manpower  involved. Some progress  to reduce  
labour  input has been made,  but there is still a long way to go.

Extended  grazing  - its potentials  and limitations

Introduction
Ewe numbers  peaked  in Ireland  in 1992 at 4.79 million  and have since declined  by 
39% to 2.93 million in 2006. However  sheep production  is still an important  farm 
enterprise  with output  equivalent  to €191 million  in 2006 accounting  for 3.6% of the 
Gross  Agricultural  Output. Prior to December  31, 2004, in the subsidy  systems  of 
sheep production  that prevailed,  it was essential  to keep ewes to claim the ewe 
premium. However  since decoupling,  premia  are now received  in the form of the 
Single  Farm Payment.  In recent  years  the price received  by producers  for lamb meat  
has not improved  whilst the cost of production  has increased  considerably.  
Furthermore  in the “Celtic Tiger economy  an increasing  proportion  of producers  
have off farm employment.  Currently  it is estimated  that 48% of sheep  producers  
obtain  a second  income  by working  off farm. To maintain  margins  sheep  producers  
have a number  of options  including  the following. Firstly, increase  lamb carcass  
output  per hectare,  which  is achievable  by improving  efficiencies  within  the farm gate.  
Secondly  avail of environmental  schemes  (e.g. REPS),  which previously  involved  
reducing  stocking  rate and consequently  necessitated  a reduction  in production  costs  
to maintain  margins.  However  it should  be noted  that in REPS  4, producers  will be 
eligible  (even when using high stocking  rates within their systems),  provided  they 
comply  with the Nitrates  Directive,  consequently  doing away with the necessity  to 
reduce  stocking  rate.
One of the main benefits  of the temperate  climate  that prevails  in Ireland  is the ability 
to grow grass  for most of the year. The aim of this paper  is to present  informatbn  on 
increasing  the use of gra,ied  grass in sheep  production  by extended  grazing  based  
primarily  on recent  research  studies  undertaken  at Knockbeg  and Athenry.
Herbage  for extended  grazing
Grass  growth  in Ireland  varies  widely  throughout  the grazing  season. Typical  grass  
dry matter growth  for March,  May, July, October and December  is 10, 90, 60, 20 and 
5kg/ha/day  respectively.  Grass  dry matter  growth  of 5kg/ha/day  in December,  and 
assuming  utilisation  rate of 60%, produces  adequate  forage  to maintain  only two 
ewes. Consequently  to extend  the grazing  season  between  December  and March,  
grass must be built up in late summer/early  autumn.  The quantity  of grass  that must  
be accumulated  for extended  grazing  depends  on date of sward closure,  level of 
nitrogen  (N) fertilizer  applied  and date of grazing.
The effects  of date of pasture  closure  and subsequent  grazing  on herbage  yield and 
proportion  of dead material  in the sward are presented  in Table 1. The earlier  the 
closing  date, the higher  the yield regardless  of grazing  date. However  it should  be 
noted that regardless  of closing date, once the swards reached  peak yield.
81
subsequent  herbage  yield declined.  For example,  for swards  which  were closed  on 
July 28, August  9 and August  30, peak yield occurred  around  November  1, and yield 
declined  subsequently  by up to 28%, 23% and 21% respectively.  The reduction  in 
yield is due to senescence  (leaf decay)  exceeding  leaf production  from November 
onwards.  Date of closure  and date of grazing  also impact  on the proportion  of dead  
material  in the sward  which  is negatively correlated  with feed value  as determined  by 
digestibility  and intake characteristics.  Earlier  closing  together  with later grazing  
increased  the proportion  of dead herbage  in the sward. Thus,  for swards  which  were  
closed  on July 28, August  9, August  30 and September  20, the proportion  of dead  
material  on December  1 was 0.51, 0.44, 0.33 and 0.34 respectively,  whilst  on March  
1 the proportion  of dead material  had increased  to 0.79, 0.56, 0.50 and 0.37 
respectively  (Table  2). Early December  and mid March  would be considered  to be 
the extremes  of the extended  grazing  season.

1 March 0.79 0.56 0.50 0.37
(Binnie  et al. 2001)
As the date of extended  grazing  is delayed,  the feed value of the herbage  declines.  
The effects  of date of grazing  of swards  closed  on September  1 on herbage  yield and 
DMD (dry matter  digestibility)  are presented  in Table  2. As stated  earlier,  once peak 
yield was achieved,  delaying  grazing date reduced  herbage  yield due to an 
accumulation  of dead herbage.  Furthermore,  DMD declined  significantly  in January  
and February,  due primarily  to the accumulation  of dead herbage  and to a lesser 
extent stem. Consequently  the feed value of extended  grazed herbage  was 
equivalent  to medium  and low feed value grass silages after December  7 and 
January  11 respectively.

Dry matter  digestibility (g/kg DM) 717 706 719 668 611
The data presented  in Tables  1 and 2 clearly  illustrate  that whilst  closing  paddocks  
early for extended  grazing  increases  herbage  yield, the proportion  of dead herbage  
increases,  leading  to a decline  in forage feed  value. However  closing  paddocks  after 
mid September substantially  reduces  the peak herbage  yield and as a consequence,  
requires  a greater  area of the farm to be closed if adequate  herbage  is to be 
available  to graze the flock during the conventional  winter indoor  feeding  period.  
Also, to comply  with the Nitrates  Directive  fertilizer  must be applied  by September  15. 
Closing  swards  early in the autumn  subsequently  produces  open swards  due to 
reduced  tiller density. Initiation  of new tillers in heavy  sward  covers  in late autumn  is 
inhibited  as light is prevented  from penetrating  the sward  canopy  to the base of the 
shoot, consequently  carbohydrate  reserves  are diverted  from tiller bud formation  to 
plant respiration.
Year  round  grazing  - the Knockbeg  system
Lamb  carcass  output  per ewe and per hectare,  and the cost of producing  each 1 kg of 
carcass  are major factors  affecting  profit margins  from sheep production.  Grass,  
either  grazed  or conserved,  accounts  for over 95% of the annual  feed budget  in mid­
season  prime iamb production.  A major  study  was undertaken  at Knockbeg  for four 
successive  years to develop  and evaluate  a system  of mid-season  prime lamb 
production  involving  year-round  grazing,  removing  the requirement  for winter housing  
and forage  conservation.  The study  consisted  of two systems  as follows:
A. Grazing,  silage and housing  (GSH). This system  involved  housing  the ewes  
unshorn  and offering  grass silage ad-libitum  for 100 days during the winter.  
During the conventional  grazing season ewes were grazed on grass/clover 
swards. The mean lambing  date was March  20. For the last 6 weeks  prior to 
lambing  the ewes received  21.5kg concentrate.  Ewes were stocked  at 14.1 
ewes/ha  and annual  fertiliser  N input  was 79kg/ha.
B. Year round grazing (YRG). This system involved  no housing or forage  
conservation.  The ewes were extended  grazed from early December  until 
lambing. During extended  grazing the ewes received  a grass dry matter  
allowance  of 1kg daily until early February  and 1.3kg daily from early Febaiary 
until 2 weeks prior to lambing. Subsequently  the ewes were spread  out for 
lambing  and received  grass ad-lib supplemented  with concentrate.  The mean  
lambing  date was March  30. For the last 6 weeks  prior to lambing  ewes received
83
23.1kg  concentrate.  Ewes were stocked  at 10.4 ewes/ha  and annual  fertiliser  N 
input  was 92kg /ha.
In both systems  the lambs received  creep feed at a rate of 300g/day  from 8 weeks 
until slaughter.  Lambs  were weaned  at 14 weeks  of age. The effects  of the  system  
on ewe body condition  are presented  in Table  3. Ewes  on both systems  had similar 
body condition  at mid pregnancy  and at weaning. However  the ewes that were 
housed  (unshorn)  on the GSH system  lost 0.3 of a condition  score between  mid 
pregnancy  and lambing. The ewes on the YRG system  maintained  condition  from 
mid pregnancy  to lambing,  indicating  adequate  nutrient  intake. Other  studies  have  
shown  that housed  unshorn  ewes have lower  food intake  during  the housing  period  
due to heat stress. In two years of extended  grazing  in the YRG system,  the ewes  
were supplemented  for a period  with 0.4kg/day  of sugar  beet pulp nuts whilst  daily 
herbage  dry matter  allowance  was reduced  by 0.2 kg/ewe,  thus increasing  total dry 
matter  intake. Supplementation  during  the extended  grazing  period  was necessary 
to maintain  grass  supply  for the duration  of the season.  In one year supplementation 
in mid pregnancy  was equivalent  to 15 days extended  grazing  herbage  allowance.
The effects  of system  on litter size and lamb performance  are presented  in Table 3. 
System  had no effect  on litter size or the numbers  of lambs  reared  per ewe put to the 
ram. Lambs  from the YRG system  were 0.7 and 2.9kg heavier  at birth and weaning,  
respectively.  Whilst  lambs  from the YRG had higher  birth and weaning  weights,  and 
were younger  at slaughter,  they were marketed  at similar  dates to those from the 
GSH system,  as they were bom later.

It can be concluded  from the Knockbeg  systems  study that year round grazing  
increased  lamb birthweight  and subsequent  lamb performance.  However,  to facilitate
84
year round grazing  stocking  rate had to be reduced  by 26%, dramatically  reducing  
lamb carcass  output by 26%, which is equivalent  to 116kg/ha.  The system  also 
raised  the following  issues  in relation  to extended  grazing:
1. What  is the feed value  of extended  grazed  herbage?
2. Why does extended  grazing  increase  lamb birth weight?
3. What is the effect of herbage  allowance  in mid and late pregnancy  on 
subsequent  performance?
4. Does  frequency of grass  allocation  affect  ewe performance?
5. Is the response  in terms of increased  lamb birth weight and subsequent 
performance  related  to stage of pregnancy  at which extended  grazing  takes  
place?
6. Can concentrate  feeding  in late pregnancy  be omitted  in an extended  grazing  
system?
7. What  is the effect  of extended  grazing  on rearing  ewe replacements?
8. What is the impact  of extended  grazing  management  on subsequent  herbage  
yield?
Each of these  issues  has been addressed  at Athenry  and is outlined  as follows.
1. What  is the feed value  of extended  grazed  herbage?
The big difference  between  the two systems  at Knockbeg  was that the year-round  
grazing  system  increased  lamb birth weight  by 0.7kg. Was the increase  in lamb 
birthweight  due to extended  grazed  herbage  having  a higher  feed value relative  to 
silage? The feeding  value of extended  grazed herbage  was evaluated  in three  
studies  at Athenry,  two relative  to grass silage and one relative  to concentrate.  In 
terms  of lamb weaning  weight  (which  takes into consideration  both lamb birth weight 
and subsequent  growth  rate) an allowance  of 1.3kg of extended  grazed  herbage  dry 
matter  in mid pregnancy  had the same  feed value  as 0.92kg  of low and medium  feed 
value  grass  silages  (Table  4). Throughout  pregnancy  0.8kg  silage  DM intake  offered  
to housed  shorn ewes had the same  feed value as 1.8kg extended  grazed  herbage  
allowance  (Table 5). For over wintering  ewe replacements,  an extended  grazed  
herbage  dry matter  allowance  of 1kg had the same  feed value as 0.5kg concentrate  
(Table 6). These data clearly illustrate  that the feed value of extended  grazed  
herbage  was no better  than low or medium  feed value  grass  silage  and consequently 
the improvement  in lamb birth and subsequent  weaning  weights  observed  in the 
Knockbeg  system  study  was not due to the feed value of extended  grazed  herbage.  
This is in agreement  with the data presented  previously  which  clearly  illustrated  that 
the proportion  of dead herbage  in the sward increases  (Tables  1 and 2), and DMD  
declines  (Table  2) as the duration  of sward  closure,  and the extended  grazing  period,  
increases.

2. Why  does extended  grazing  increase  lamb birth weight?
Winter  conditions  in Ireland  are relatively  mild. Consequently,  ewes that are housed  
unshorn  may have difficulty  in dissipating  body heat due to the unique  insulating  
properties  of the fleece, leading to ineffective  heat regulation  and heat stress,  
particularly  in late pregnancy.  Ewes  managed  on extended  grazing  are less likely  to 
be affected  by heat stress relative  to housed  unshorn  ewes. Shearing  ewes at 
housing  increases  lamb birth weight,  relative  to housed  unshorn  ewes, similar  to the 
weight  of lambs  from ewes extended  grazed  throughout  pregnancy  (Tables  5 and 7). 
Consequently  the increased  lamb birth weight  due to extended  grazing  is most likely  
due to reduced  heat stress,  as evident  by the longer  gestation  length  (Table  7) rather 
than by extended  grazed  herbage  having  higher  feed value. The data presented  in 
Tables 5 and 7 clearly show that the improvement  in lamb birth weight and 
subsequent growth  rate from extended  grazed  ewes  relative  to housed  unshorn  ewes  
can be achieved  indoors  by shearing  ewes at the point  of housing.

3. What is the effect of herbage  allowance in mid and late oreanancv  on subsequent
performance?
One of the major factors  determining  the proportion  of the farm that needs to be 
closed  in September  for extended  grazing  is the daily grass allowance  which  will be 
offered  to the ewes in mid and late pregnancy.  The effects  of herbage  allowance  
offered  in mid pregnancy  from early December  to four weeks prior to lambing  on 
herbage  intake and animal performance  (Table 4) were evaluated  in a study at 
Athenry.  Increasing  herbage  dry matter  allowance  by O.Skg/day  increased  forage  dry 
matter  intake  by 0.19kg/ewe  daily. However,  utilisation  rate was reduced  from 44 to 
34%. Increasing  herbage  allowance  increased  ewe condition  score by 0.24 units at 
lambing. Lambs  from ewes on the higher  grass allowance  were heavier  at birth 
(+0.46kg)  and at weaning  (+2kg)  and grew  faster  from birth to weaning  (+17g/day).  It 
was also noted that increasing  herbage  allowance  in mid pregnancy  tended to 
reduce  assistance  required  at lambing. Furthermore,  increased  herbage  allowance 
resulted  in less damage  to the paddocks  and increased  subsequent  herbage  
regrowth  (discussed  later).
87
Altering herbage  allowance  in late pregnancy  influences  potential  concentrate 
supplementation  requirement  as well as the area of the farm which  must be closed  in 
October,  for extended  grazing  in February  and March. The nutrient  requirement  of 
the ewe increases  dramatically  in late pregnancy  due to the rapidly  growing  foetuses. 
The weight  of the foetus  increases  by 85, 50 and 20% respectively  during  the last 8, 
4 and 2 weeks  of pregnancy.  During  the last six weeks  of pregnancy  the energy 
requirements  of single  and twin bearing  ewes increase  by 40 and 60%, respectively.  
The effects  of grass allocation  in late pregnancy  on performance  of single  and twin 
bearing  ewes are presented  in Table 8. With single bearing  ewes increasing  daily 
herbage  dry matter  allowance  by 0.3 and 0.4kg/ewe  during  weeks  4 and 3, and 2 and 
1 prior to lambing maintained  ewe body condition  score and increased  lamb 
birthweight  by 0.9kg. With twin bearing  ewes, increasing  herbage  dry matter 
allowance  by 0.2 and 0.7kg/ewe  daily respectively  during  weeks  4 and 3, and 2 and 1 
prior to lambing,  or supplementing  with a total of 8.5kg concentrate  prior to lambing,  
increased  lamb birth weight by 0.8kg. Furthermore  concentrate  supplementation 
increased  ewe condition  score  by 0.5 of a unit at lambing.

4. Does  frequency of grass  allocation  affect  ewe performance?
One of the advantages  often quoted  for extended  grazing  is the reduced  labour  
requirement  relative  to feeding  ewes that are housed. Normally  herbage  is allocated 
daily, which  can be time consuming  (particularly for large flocks)  as fences  (Flexinet) 
need to be erected  ahead  of the ewes and the back fences  have to be moved. In 
order to evaluate  if labour  input can be reduced  the effect of frequency  of herbage  
allocation  on forage intake and animal  performance  has been evaluated  in recent 
studies  at Athenry  (Table  9). In these  studies  the ewes were extended  grazed  from 
mid December  to four weeks  prior to  lambing  at which  stage  they were housed  and 
received  a total of 19kg concentrate  prior to lambing. During  extended  grazing  the 
ewes were allocated  herbage  either daily or twice weekly. Frequency  of herbage 
allocation  did not alter forage  intake  or utilisation.  Furthermore  frequency of herbage 
allocation  had no effect  on lamb birth or weaning  weights,  or lamb growth  rate from 
birth to weaning.

(Keady  and Hanrahan,  2007a)
The national  average  weaning  rate is about 1.3 lambs per ewe put to the ram. 
Consequently,  most flocks are comprised  of ewes that produce  only singles  and 
twins. As many sheep  producers  scan their flocks  for litter size in mid pregnancy 
they can group  ewes accordingly.  An on-farm  study  was undertaken  by Teagasc  to 
evaluate the effects  of allocating  herbage  daily to single  and twin bearing  ewes in iate 
pregnancy,  either  grouped  separately  (according  to litter size) or in a leader-follower 
system  (twin-bearing  ewes were leaders  followed  by the single  bearing  ewes). The 
daily herbage  dry matter  allowances  per ewe for weeks  7 to 6, 5 to 4, 3 to 2 and prior 
to “spread  out” for lambing  were as follows:  1.3, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.6kg for single  bearing  
ewes grazed separately;  1.4, 1.6, 1.9 and 2.7 for twin bearing ewes grazed  
separately;  2.7, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.3 for the twin bearing  ewes  followed  by single  bearing  
ewes in the leader-follower  system. Allocating  grass daily to the single-  and twin­
bearing  ewes separately  or in the leader-follower  system  did not affect lamb birth 
weight, lambing  assistance,  growth rate or weaning  weight  (Table 10). However 
single bearing  ewes in the leader-follower  system  had a lower condition  score at 
lambing.  The leader-folluwer  system  reduced  labour  requirements  by decreasing  the 
number  of fences  required  by 50% in a flock  of predominantly  single  and twin bearing  
ewes.

5. Is the response  in terms of increased  lamb birth weight and subsequent
perfonmance  related  to stage  of pregnancy  In which  extended  arazing  takes  place?
On many sheep  units where  extended  grazing  is practiced,  there is only sufficient
herbage  available  for part of the extended  grazing  season. Consequently,  many  
producers  ask whether  they should extend graze ewes either in mid or late 
pregnancy.  A study  was undertaken  in which  ewes were either  housed  for mid, late 
or throughout  pregnancy,  and extended  grazed in either mid, late or throughout 
pregnancy  (Table  7). Ewes  that were housed  and extended  grazed  received  19 and 
15kg concentrate/head  daily during  the last six weeks  prior to lambing. Relative  to 
housed unshorn  ewes extended  grazing in mid, late or throughout  pregnancy 
increased  lamb weight  by 0.1, 0.3 and 0.7kg and increased  weaning  weight  by 1.2, 
1.7 and 2.8kg, respectively.  Consequently,  if only limited grass supplies  are 
available  for extended  grazing,  extended  grazing  in late pregnancy  gives the greater 
response  in terms of lamb birth and weaning  weights  relative  to extending  grazing  in 
mid pregnancy.
6^_Can concentrate  feeding  in late pregnancy  be omitted  in an extended  grazing
system?
In extended  grazing,  omitting  concentrate  supplementation  reduces  feed cost whilst 
also increasing  grazed  grass  requirements,  which  subsequently  puts pressure  on the 
stock carrying  capacity  (stocking  rate) of the system. A study undertaken  at 
Knockbeg  (Table  8) evaluated  the effect of grass allowance  in late pregnancy  on 
single-  and twin-bearing  ewes. Increasing  herbage  allowance  of single-bearing  ewes  
during  the last six weeks  prior to lambing  increased  lamb birth weight. Furthermore,  
increasing  herbage  allowance  to twin bearing  ewes increased  lamb birth weight 
whilst maintaining  ewe condition  score. When assessed  by lamb birth weight,  each 
1kg concentrate  supplementation  in late pregnancy  had the same feed value as 
1.5kg herbage  dry matter  allowance.  Concentrate  supplementation  also increased 
ewe condition  score  by 0.4 of a unit. In an on-farm  study  undertaken  by Teagasc  in 
which  the ewes were turned  out to pasture  in late pregnancy,  single  and twin-bearing 
ewes produced  heavy  lambs  (5.9 and 4.9kg  birth weight,  respectively)  in the absence 
of concentrate  supplementation  (Table  6).
7. What  is the effect  of extended  grazing  when rearing  ewe replacements?
Rearing  ewe replacements  is a major  cost in lamb production.  Reducing  the cost of 
rearing  replacements  by €20/head,  either  by reducing  the replacement  rate or feed 
cost, is equivalent  to 18.5c/kg  of lamb carcass  produced  by the ewe during  her life 
time production  cycle. An on-farm  study was undertaken  by Teagasc  in 2006 to 
evaluate  the effects  of grass allowance  and concentrate  supplementation  on ewe 
lamb performance  during extended  grazing  and the subsequent  grazing  season 
(Table 6). Increasing  herbage  allowance  increased  growth rate during extended 
grazing  by 85g/day.  When assessed  by ewe replacement  weight  at the end of the 
extended  grazing  season,  offering  0.5kg concentrate  daily had the same  feed value  
as increasing  herbage  dry matter  allowance  by 1kg daily. Even when assessed  by 
the weight  of the replacement  ewes in mid August,  0.5kg concentrate  during the 
previous  extended  grazing  season  had the same feed value as 0.9kg of extended 
grazed  herbage  dry matter  allowance
90
8. What is the impact  of extended  grazina  management  on subsequent  herbage
yield?
In an all year round grazing  system,  grass supply  will be most limiting  in autumn.  
Grass supply is also a major concern  for the first two months after lambing.  
Consequently,  the effects  of extended  grazing  management  on herbage  yield during  
the early part of the subsequent  grazing  season  impacts  on potential  stocking  rate. 
The effect of extended  grazing  management  on herbage  yield early during the 
subsequent  grazing  season  was evaluated  at Athenry. In that study, swards  were  
grazed  either between  December  6 and 12, December  27 and January 3, or January 
17 and 23. During  each grazing  period  ewes were allocated  herbage  dry matter  at 
either  1.0 or 1.8kg/ewe/day  and the allocation  was made  either daily  or twice  weekly.  
Increasing  daily herbage  dry matter  allowance  from 1.0 to 1.8kg/ewe  at grazing  
increased  subsequent  herbage  dry matter  yield by 1.14t/ha (Table  11). Frequency  of 
herbage  allocation  during  extended  grazing  did not affect  subsequent  herbage  yield 
(Table  11). However,  each 1-day  delay in grazing  date reduced  herbage  dry matter 
yield by 54.2kg/ha  (Figure  1), which  is equivalent  to 18 ewe grazing  days. The data 
from this study clearly illustrated  that delayed  grazing had a major effect on 
subsequent  herbage  yield. A subsequent  study undertaken  at Athenry  in 2007  
showed  that, in extended  grazed pastures  that had been grazed between  mid 
December  and late January,  grazing  date and herbage  allocation  at grazing  had a 
big impact  on pasture  damage.  When  assessed  in early  April the percentage  of the 
sward which was categorised  as bare ground  varied from 3 to 22% for pastures  
grazed at high (1.8kg/ewe  daily) and low (I.Okg/ewe  daily) herbage  dry matter 
allowances  the previous  winter. However by mid May the percentage  of bare ground  
was reduced  to 5.5 and 8.8%, respectively.

Potentials  of extended  grazing
Extended  grazing offers a number  of “attractions ” for mid season prime lamb 
production  as follows:
a. A sheep  production  system  can be established  without  the need for winter  
housing  and specialised  feeding  facilities  as the ewes are at pasture  year 
round. As a consequence,  fixed costs are reduced  substantially.  However 
to comply with the Nitrates Directive  adequate  slurry and/or farmyard 
manure  storage  facilities  for a 6 week  period  are required.
b. Year round  grazing  facilitates  the management  of ‘flying  flocks ’ and thus the 
opportunity  to enter sheep  production  when lamb prices are high and exit 
rapidly  at low cost for a number  of seasons  when lamb prices  are low.
c. The  cost of producing  each 1kg of lamb carcass  is reduced  due to a 
reduction  in fixed costs. However,  some herbage  needs  to be harvested  to 
control  grass growth  and maintain  grass  quality  for the grazing  flock. Whilst 
the gross margin per ewe is increased,  gross margin  per hectare  (a key 
measure  of profitability)  is reduced.
d. Lambing  ewes at pasture  reduces  labour  requirement,  particularly  in flocks 
predominantly  of single and twin bearing  ewes, as ewes only need to be 
moved short distances  to paddocks  and lambing  pens are not required.  
However,  ewes that need to be handled  are more  difficult  to capture.
e. Extended  grazing provides  a cheap system for rearing replacements,  
particularly  where  pasture  is allocated  twice  weekly rather  than daily.
f. Extended  grazing  can represent  an alternative  system  for producers  that 
operate  at a low stocking  rate.
92
Limitations  of extended  grazing  systems
Whilst  year round  grazing  has potentials,  it also has various  limitations.  These  are as 
follows:
• Stocking  rate is limited  to a maximum  of around  10 ewes/ha,  consequently  
reducing  potential  lamb carcass  output  by up to 26%. In year-round  grazing  
the grass requirements  peak in September  due to the following;  a) 
approximately  50% of the grazing  area needs  to be closed  in September  and 
early October  to accumulate  grass for grazing  from mid December  to 
lambing  in early  April; b) ewes  need to be prepared  for mating  which  impacts  
on the next lamb crop (previous  studies  at Athenry  have shown  that each 
one unit increase  in condition  score  at mating  increases  weaning  rate by 0.1 
lambs/ewe  put to the ram); c) any lambs remaining  in September  and 
October  require  high quality pasture to finish.
• Year round grazing is an inefficient  system for utilising herbage. As 
discussed  previously,  during extended  grazing  up to 28% of accumulated  
herbage  may be lost, utilisation  of remaining  herbage  may be as low as 40% 
and feed value declines  steadily  (due to senescence  of leaf being greater 
than green  leaf production)  during  the extended  grazing  period.
• There is evidence  to show that herbage  management  during extended  
grazing  impacts  on sward quality. Recent  studies  at Athenry  have shown  
that in the April and May, following  extended  grazing  the proportion  of the 
sward  categorised  as “bare ground"  was as high as 22 %.
• The success  of extended  grazing  is very dependent  on weather  and ground  
conditions.  For example  at Athenry  and Oakpark  mean annual rainfall  
during  the last 30 years  was 1162 and 789 mm, respectively.  This difference  
can have a major  impact  on herbage  utilisation  and potential  sward  damage.
• Good  grassland  management  is essential  in early summer  in a year-round- 
grazing  system,  as grass availability  will exceed  demand. Consequently 
paddocks  need to be removed  for ensiling. Furthermore  there is evidence  
from the Knockbeg  systems  study  that from weeks  10-14, lamb growth  rate 
was similar for lambs  from the YRG and GSH systems  with growth  rates of 
220 and 228g/day  respectively.  Consequently  the potential  benefit  of the 
higher  lamb birth weight on age at slaughter is not fully exploited.
• Even at a low stocking rate (10 ewes/ha) strategic concentrate  
supplementation  (equivalent  to approximately  2 weeks  herbage  supply)  was 
required  in Knockbeg  to ration herbage  supply  for extended  grazing  in two 
out of four seasons.
• With  outdoor  lambing,  lambing  date is delayed  in order  to reduce  the risk of 
severe  weather.  Consequently  most of the major  annual  price falls for lamb 
carcass  have  occurred  prior  to the  lambs  being  drafted  for sale.
• On a 50ha  farm, year round  grazing  reduces  gross  margin  by up to €10,150.
93
other  considerations
Currently  48% of sheep  producers  have an off-farm  income. Consequently,  
during  the winter, having  the ewes housed  may be more suitable  for part- 
time farmers,  as they can be fed at night. Using modem  equipment,  during  
the housing  period,  large numbers  of sheep  can be fed in a short period  of 
time
Whilst  extending  grazing  ewes throughout  pregnancy  increases  lamb birth 
weight relative  to lambs from unshorn  housed  ewes, lambs from shorn  
housed  ewes are of a similar weight  at birth, weaning  and age at slaughter.  
Consequently,  the benefits  in lamb performance  from extended  grazing  can 
be obtained  indoors  by shearing  the ewes at housing.
With the new proposed  REPS 4 scheme,  intensive  systems  of lamb 
production  comply (provided  they comply with the Nitrates Directive),  
consequently  there is no need  to reduce  stocking  rate, as is required  for year 
round  grazing.
Financial  analysis  of the systems
Calculations  designed  to show the effect of system of mid season  prime lamb  
production  on income,  costs and margins  (excluding  labour  and machinery  costs),  
based  on the Knockbeg  systems  study are presented  in Table 12. Lamb carcass 
weight  and price  were assumed  to be 19.5kg  and €3.50/kg  respectively.  Concentrate 
was costed  at €240/tonne.  Silage was harvested  using the big bale system. In 
costing  sheep housing,  it was assumed  that a 50% grant was available  and that 
depreciation  was over a 30-year  period. In the year round grazing  system,  excess 
herbage  was ensiled  and sold as big bale silage.
Margins  per ewe were higher  on the year-round  grazing  system. However,  margin  
per hectare,  which is the major factor  affecting  income,  was higher  for the grass- 
silage-housing  system. The grass-silage-housing  system  increased  gross margin  by 
€203/ha. On a 50ha farm, year round grazing decreased  gross margin by 
€10, 150/annum.  As lamb price increases,  the difference  in gross  margin  per hectare 
between  the two systems  increases  in favour  of the grass-silage-housing  system  
relative  to the year-round-grazing  system.

Conclusions
It is concluded  that an effective  year round grazing system can be practiced  
successfully.  However  stocking  rate is reduced  significantly,  dramatically  reducing  
lamb carcass  output/ha  and gross margin/ha.  However  to comply  with the Nitrates  
Directive  adequate  slurry and/or  farmyard  manure  storage  facilities  for a 6 week 
period  is required.  Extended  grazing;
a. increases  lamb birth weight  relative to  lambs  from housed  unshorn  ewes;
b. limits stocking  rate to a maximum  of 10 ewes/ha;
c. requires  excellent  grassland  management  to be successful;
d. provides  a low cost system,  particularly  for 'flying  flocks ’,
e. is a relatively  inefficient  system  of utilising  herbage.
Allocating  herbage  twice weekly rather than daily has no effect on animal  
perfonmance  or subsequent  herbage  growth,  but concentrate  supplementation  is still
95
required  to enable  the year round grazing  system  to succeed.  The improvement  in 
lamb birth and weaning  weights  due to extended  grazing  can be achieved  indoors  by 
shearing  ewes at housing.  On a 50ha  farm year round  grazing  reduces  gross  margin  
by up to €10,150.

Breeding  for easier  care
Samuel  Wharry
Harphall,  Camlough,  Co Antrim
Introduction
The farm comprises  approximately  550 acres at Harphall  in the southern  Glens of 
Antrim. It is a hill farm rising from 50 feet above  sea level to about 1200 feet, the land 
varies  from heavy  clays through  red mineral  soils to blanket  peat on the hill. The farm 
stock comprises  500 breeding  ewes, 120 dry hoggets  with suckler  cows grazed  in the 
summer.
The foundations  of the sheep flock are Blackface  ewes with about 180 bred pure to 
provide  replacements  both for themselves  and for the crossing  flock  of 120 ewes,  which  
are crossed  to Texel, Lleyn or Colbred  rams. These  provide  the replacements  for the 
flock of 200 crossbred  ewes,  which  are crossed  with Suffolk  or Texel  rams. Any suitable  
surplus  ewe lambs  are sold for breeding,  and the rest along  with the wethers  are mostly  
sold finished,  although  depending  on trade some may be sold as stores. A few 
Blackface  ram lambs are also used for breeding  at home before being soid as 
shearlings.
Signet  recording  scheme
The pure Blackface  ewes have been recorded  through  the MLC/Signet  sheep breeder  
service  since 1997, and since  2002 the farm has been a member  of the Sire Reference  
Scheme  that allows  for direct  performance  comparisons  between  different  flocks in the 
scheme.  Last year the Blackface  breed moved  to across  breed analysis,  which allows  
direct comparison  of sheep  across  all recording  flocks in Britain  and Ireland, This will 
hopefully  allow for the identification  of the best genetics  within the breed,  and speed  up 
progress.
The Signet  scheme  produces  seven Estimated  Breeding  Vaiues  (EBVs)  based not only 
on the animals'  own performance,  but also on the performance  of all its recorded  
relatives  within  the scheme  (Table  1). These  seven  traits are used to produce  an overall  
index,  which  is a quick  guide  to an animals  breeding  potential.
Initially the scheme  was only used to maintain  the size and conformation  of the 
Blackface  flock, probably  not enough  attention  was paid to maternal  traits. However,  as 
information  on the ewes built up, it became  clear  that ewes that were giving  problems  at 
lambing,  and rearing  poorer  lambs,  almost  invariably  had lower EBVs for maternal  and 
8-week  weights. Consequently,  today when selecting  new stock rams individual  EBVs  
are used rather  than just the index, placing  particular  emphasis  on maternal,  8-week  
weight and scan weight, whilst keeping  muscle  depth and litter size above breed  
average. On this farm it is generally  felt that the ewes are big enough,  and so no
97
attempt  is made  to increase  mature  ewe size any further,  although  this tends to happen  
naturally  with higher scan weights. As long as growth traits are good, there is no 
problem  with slightly  positive  fat depths  as the ewes will need to retain body condition  
over winter, and considering  the current  price of concentrates,  the last thing that is 
wanted  is big lean lambs  which  will have  to be pumped  full of meal to finish.

Eight-week  weight Potential  growth  from birth to 8 weeks  of age.
Mature  size High figures  will increase  mature  size.

(i.e. better  milkers  and mothers).
Scan  weightPotential  growth  to scanning  at 20 weeks  old. Higher  
figures  will result  in heavier  carcasses  at the same  fat class.
Muscle  depthMeasured  by ultrasound  scanning.  Higher  figures  indicate

Hillsborough  recording  scheme
Since it became  available  in 2005 the farm has been using the Hillsborough  Recording  
Scheme  for crossing  Blackface  ewes. These  are used primarily  to produce  crossbred  
replacements,  and would be mainly  lower index or ewes that don't conform  as well to 
breed type. It Is a simple  scheme,  which requires  only a little time and effort from the 
farmer. At birth the lambs are tagged  and the parentage  recorded  along with a simple  
tick box score for lambing  difficulty  and milking  and mothering  ability. The books are 
returned  to Hillsborough,  and that is it for recording  until weaning  time, unless  a ewe has 
a particular  problem  such as mastitis  or footrot  which can be noted in the book. At 
weaning  the lambs  are weighed  and from this information  a list of ewe lambs ranked  in 
order  of their  suitability  as replacements  is produced.  The final choice  is still down  to the 
famner,  but knowing  that a lamb’s dam had an awful lambing,  and was a lousy mother  
can make  such decisions  a lot easier
Benefits  of recording
Is it all worth it? The question  is often asked,  “Where  is the time for all that recording? ” 
The answer  is - “Where is the time to lamb a flock of ewes which haven't  been  
recorded?  All sheep  farms will have ewes which get on with the job of producing  two
98
good lambs  without  help and making  a decent  job of rearing  them year after year, and 
equally  there are plenty  of ewes which give hassle,  have little colostrum  and don't want 
to know about their lambs. There is no doubt as to which one should be kept for a 
replacement,  but if there is no recording  can you really be sure that that flashy  looking  
ewe lamb isn't a big single  that you hauled  out of the ewe at 03.00 one morning,  and 
that it's not from a long line of flashy  looking  but lousy mothers?  Recording  for easier  
care traits is certainly  a long-term  strategy,  but it is amazing  how quickly  progress  can 
be made,  just by identifying  and culling  problem  ewes from the flock. This progress  is 
cumulative;  so long as you are using recorded  tups to breed replacements  each 
generation  should  be superior  to the last.
On this farm we have certainly  seen the benefits.  Adopter  crates  are things  of the past, 
and in the last three years only one ewe rejected  her own lamb, (needless  to say she is 
no longer  with us). In 2007  the farm turned  out a batch  of 97 Blackface  ewes with twins,  
194 lambs,  and at 8 weeks  old weighed  192 of them. They were checked  once a day 
for tetany  in the ewes, but otherwise  were left to get on with it, which  they did. The aim 
now is to breed  a ewe which  is “Fit for Purpose ” rather  than one which  looks pretty.
Future  developments
So what does the future hold? There are a number  of new developments  becoming  
available  to sheep  farmers. Faecal  egg count EBVs are already  available  to measure  
worm resistance,  the Blackface  sire reference  group  are investigating  EBVs  for longevity  
and what information  we need to record  to measure  lamb survivability.  The increasing  
use of DNA technology  means that all these together  with a simple test for footrot  
resistance  could soon be available,  but in order  to benefit  from all this technology  sheep  
farmers,  and specially  breeders,  must get involved  in the uptake  of recording  schemes.  
Whether  it is something  as simple  as ear notching  ewe lambs out of good mothers  
through  to getting  involved  in sire referencing  schemes,  the ethos of breeding  for easier  
care is straightfonArard.  It is to record  and cull problems  for an easier  future.

Management  of the hill sheep flock  at Leenane
L. O'Malley
Teagasc,  Hill Sheep  Farm,  Leenane,  Co Mayo
Introduction
The purpose  of this paper is to outline  the performance  of the ewe flock at the 
Teagasc  hill farm with particular  emphasis  on management  inputs  around  mating  and 
lambing  as an example  of the performance  that can be achieved  in terms  of ewe and 
lamb survival  without  round-the-clock  supervision  during  the lambing  season.
Farm  facilities  and production  system
The Teagasc  Hill Sheep Farm is located in the Sheffry  hills near Leenane  and 
consists  of 250ha  of hill land and 20ha of reclaimed  green-land.  The farm varies  in 
altitude  from 15 to 275m above  sea level and average  rainfall  at the farm was 2124 
mm for the 10 years 1995 to 2005. The green-land  area was re-seeded  in 1991/92  
and the swards  are mainly  ryegrass;  it is possible  to cut silage  from about half this 
area.
There  is a stock-proof  perimeter  fence  and the green  land is fenced  into 10 paddocks 
- mostly sheep wire but has electric  fence around  the main lambing  paddocks.  
There is a slatted  shed that can accommodate  200 ewes. The handling  facility  is 
built along side a 3-bay hayshed  with the race and weighing  scales  under  the shed  
roof; the hayshed  also provides  storage  for equipment  (fertiliser spreader,  topper and 
sprayer  etc.). There  is also a small  tractor,  trailer  and transport  box, livestock  trailer 
and block  cutter on the farm.
The flock consists  of about 340 Scottish  Blackface  (local type) ewes and about 80 
homebred  replacements.  The ewes are managed  as two integrated  systems:-
• Hill system  (200 ewes)  - ewes spend  about  70% of the year on the hill and 
have use of 5.6ha  of green-land  for mating,  lambing  and for ewes with singles  
males  to weaning.  Wether lambs  are sold to export  market  for light lamb.
• Lowland  system  (140 ewes)  - ewes spend  about  30% of the year on the hill 
and have use of 14.4ha  of green-land  for mating  and from lambing  to weaning.  
Lambs remain on green land until sale or indoors  for finishing  from early  
October.
Replacement  ewes are housed  (on silage with concentrate  supplement)  from mid 
November  to late April and spend  the rest of the year on the hill. The ewes in the Hill 
system  are bred pure (to generate  flock replacements)  while  the ewes in the Lowland  
system  are crossed  (usually  with Belclare  rams)  to produce  prolific  ewe replacements 
for sale. Ewes spend  their first three breeding  seasons  in the hill system  and are 
then transferred  to the Lowland  system  where they remain until they have to be 
culled.
100
Ewes are checked  for breeding  soundness  (teeth, udder,  feet) at weaning  and those 
that are to be culled are identified;  cull ewes are sold at an appropriate  stage  
between  weaning  and late September.  Broken  mouth  is the principal  culling  reason
Management  of ewe flocks
All ewes are on the hill grazing  from weaning  until just before  joining - with the 
exception  of a small number of ewes in poor condition  that are removed  from the hill 
earlier. Between  weaning  and mating, the lamb crop grazes the green-land.  
Crossbred  wether  lambs  are sold to slaughter  at French  weights;  purebred  wethers  
go to the light lamb market; crossbred  females  are sold off the farm in early  
September.  In early October all remaining  lambs  are housed  (for finishing)  to ensure  
that sufficient  grass is on the paddocks  for the mating  period. The mating  system  
involves  single ram groups  for both Hill (5 rams)  and Lowland  (5 rams)  systems  so 
that sire and dam are known  for every  lamb. Ewes are put to ram in late October  for 
the Lowland  system  and in the third week of November  for the Hill system. The 
joining  period  is 35 days in both cases;  rams are fitted with crayons  and ewes mated  
within the first 10 days get a permanent  colour mark to facilitate  introduction  to 
concentrate  feed 10 days before  the remainder  of the flock and so that they can be 
put to grass before  the rest of the flock (Lowland  system)  - thus making  best use of 
the scarce  grass  supply  at lambing  time. The paddocks  on the green-land  area are 
used for mating  and when rams are removed  all ewes are put to the hill until early 
January  (Lowland  system)  or early February  (Hill system).  The management  of the 
two flocks differs from this point until lambing. All ewes are scanned  in mid­
pregnancy  to identify  twin-bearing  ewes.
Lowland  flock
Ewes in the Lowland  flock are housed  in a slatted  shed in early January  and offered  
silage ad libitum. Ewes with twins (about  50%) are separated  into early and late 
lambing  groups and are offered a proprietary  ewe-and-lamb  ration (18% crude  
protein)  starting  at 225g per day at week 7 prior to the expected  lambing  date. The 
allowance  is gradually  increased  to 700g per day before lambing. Single-bearing  
ewes are also separated  into early and late groups  and get 225g per day increasing  
to 450g per day for the final week  before  lambing.  Ewes are put to pasture  just prior 
to their expected  lambing  date (based on early or late mating). Concentrate 
supplementation  is continued  outdoors,  on a flock basis,  using  the daily allowance  for 
singles.  As ewes lamb they are drafted  from the lambing  paddock  and get no further  
concentrates.
Hill flock
All twin-bearing  ewes from the Hill flock (about 10%) along with any thin ewes  
(condition  score  2 or less) are drafted  at scanning  onto an enclosed  area of the hill (4 
ha) and get hay ad libitum  plus concentrates  - starting  at 230g per ewe per day and 
increasing  gradually  to 454g at 3 weeks  prior to onset  of lambing.  The remainder  of 
the ewes are returned  to the hill, and body condition  is checked  every  3 weeks;  any 
thin ewes are drafted  to the enclosed  hill area for supplementary  feeding. Ewes  
drafted  for supplementary  feeding  remain in the enclosed  hill paddock  until they
101
lamb. About  50% of the Hill flock ewes are off the hill by the third week  of March  (3 
weeks prior to start of lambing);  the remainder  stay on the hill until just prior to 
lambing  when  they are moved  onto a paddock  in the green-land  area for lambing  and 
get concentrates  (450g/day)  until they lamb. All ewes are drafted  from the lambing  
areas as they lamb. Ewes with twins or male singles  are drafted  to the same 
paddock  while  ewes  with female  singles  are drafted  to a separate  paddock.
Lambing  supervision
From the onset of lambing  the first daily inspection  is at 6:30 AM - this is the most 
important  inspection  of the day as any problems  that have arisen  during  the night are 
identified. Newborn  lambs that have bonded  with their dam and are suckling  
satisfactorily  are drafted,  during late morning,  to a nearby  yard area. Immediately 
before  entering  the yard, lambs ’ navels  are sprayed  with iodine solution,  then they 
are tagged,  weighed  and sexed,  the mother ’s tag number  is also recorded  along  with 
her condition  score and weight. All dead bom lambs are weighed  and details  
recorded.  Udders  are checked  carefully  for sufficient  milk supply  and mastitis  before  
moving  animals  to the grazing  paddock.  Ewes are checked  ~ hourly  during  the day 
until around  4.30 PM; checking  is done again between  6.30 PM and 8 or 9 PM, 
depending  on daylight.  There  is nobody  on the farm between  the last check and 6.30 
AM. Records  show  that 40% of lambs  are bom during  this period.
Ewe performance
Details  on the performance  of the two systems  are summarised  in Table 1, for the 5 
years  to 2006. The proportion  of ewes  that lambed  was 92% for both flocks. This is 
considered  satisfactory  given that single-sire  mating  groups  are used and joining  is 
limited to 35 days. A figure around  95% would be expected  under conventional 
mating  conditions.
Table  1. Summary  of ewe performance  for 2002  - 2006
Hill system Lowland  system
Ewe live weight  (kg) 42.5 51.5
Percent  ewes lambed 92 92

Lambs  reared  per ewe to ram 0.98 1.36
Lamb  mortality  (total)  (%) 4.9 6.1
Annual  ewe mortality  (%) 2.5 4.8
Lamb  survival  is good; the mortality  shown  in the table includes  any dead-bom  lambs  
and any lambs that die between  birth and weaning.  About  two-thirds  of all lamb 
losses  are classified  as peri-natal  (i.e. either  bom dead or died within  24 h of birth).  
In the Lowland  system  the incidence  of lamb mortality  was lower for twins (5.0%)  
than singles (7.5%). The difference  reflected  a difference  in peri-natal  mortality.
102
Annual  ewe mortality  is about 3.5%. Ewe and lamb mortality  are well below the 
national  figures for lowland  or hill farms
Distribution  of iambing
The spread  of lambing  over the lambing  season  is a key indicator  of the labour  
required,  as supervision  will be needed  regardless  of the number  of ewes lambing  on 
any given day. The pattern  of lambing  is shown  in Figure  1 for the last 3 seasons  - 
day 1 represents  the first lambing  day in each year. This was March  21, 23 and 24 
for 2005,  2006  and 2007, respectively.
Figure  1. Actual  daily incidence  of iambing  at Leenane  - combined  data for 
2005 to 2007
Day of lambing  season
As the Hill flock is put to the ram 3 weeks  after the Lowland  flock, the total lambing  
season  lasts for 42 to 45 days. The last few ewes in the Hill flock lamb during  the 
first week  of May.
In order to combine  the information  from both Hill and Lowland  flocks to get the 
lambing  pattern  that would  occur  if all ewes  were put to the ram on the same  day the 
lambing  date was expressed  as the number  of days relative  to the mean date for 
each flock. The combined  information  gave the pattern  shown in Figure  2. This 
shows that just over 92% of the ewes lambed  within a 20-day  period - a very 
compact  lambing  pattern. This pattern  means  that during  the 20-day  period,  4 to 5% 
of the ewes would lamb each day - i.e. 8 to 10 ewes per day for a 200-ewe  flock.  
This is about  the number  that lamb at Leenane  under our current  mating  programme,  
but for a 340-ewe  flock. If all ewes at Leenane  were put to the ram at the same  time 
the number  lambing  per day would  be around  15 to 18 ewes  - this could be managed  
without  any difficulty  given  the present  faciiities  at the farm.

Conclusions
These  results  show  what  can be achieved  on a farm that is well organised  in terms  of 
fencing and handling  facilities,  and has a well-defined  annual management 
programme  with only essential  farm equipment  for a sheep system. Total lamb 
mortality  can be kept below  10% for flocks lambed  outdoors  on lowland  without  any 
supervision  during the hours of darkness  - in the present  case this represents  the 
hours  between  9 PM and 6.30 AM - and with a break  between  4.30 and 6.30 PM.
The lamb survival  recorded  at Leenane  is achieved  despite  the very high rainfall  at 
that location  and the exposed  nature  of the site. The Lowland  flock is achieving  an 
output of 1.34 lambs reared per ewe to the ram, which is above the average  
performance  for lowland  flocks in the National  Farm Survey. Thus, it can be argued  
that the performance  of the Lowland  flock in this study is a relevant  and achievable 
target for well managed  lowland  flocks. However,  the fact that ewes are lambed  
outdoors  is probably  a factor  in the high survival  rates achieved,  in that it facilities  the 
expression  of natural  mothering  instincts,  which  are likely impaired  somewhat  under 
crowded  indoor  lambing  conditions.  It is also suggested  that even if all ewes were 
put to the ram on the same day, one operator  could manage  the lambing  as over 
90% of the ewes  would  lamb within  a 21-day period.
The results  show that intensive  night-time  supervision  is not essential  and thus one 
of the periods  seen as the major burden  in flock management  can be rationalised  
without  prejudice  to good animal  survival  - at least under the conditions  that obtain  at 
Leenane.

Introduction
Farm details  are outlined  in Table 1. Prior to 2004 lambing  ewes started  in February  
and continued  in batches  until mid April. The problem  with this system  was two fold. 
Firstly  all sheep  were housed  for the winter,  which  was very labour  intensive.  Secondly,  
sheep  were turned  out as soon as possible  after lambing  to reduce  the workload  in the 
yard, resulting  in a requirement  for early grass, which was difficult  to achieve  with a 
stocking  rate of 15 ewes per ha. In short, this was a high input high output  system  that 
required  high levels  of concentrate  feed and fertiliser  to keep the lambs  thriving.

In 2004 the farm was at a crossroads  (parents  retired  from farming;  pressing  need to 
develop  a system  that was more labour  efficient.  The choices  available  were:
105
Orinvest heavily  in a high fixed cost system  of farming  where new housing  plus 
feeding  equipment  would  be required;
look at alternatives,  which would include  no housing,  reducing  stocking  rate, 
REPS  (?) and outwintering  the sheep  on the Knockbeg  system.
The latter option was taken, and to date is working  successfully  - one individual  
currently  manages  the farm, with a modest  amount  of hired labour at lambing  time 
(usually  students).
To operate  the extended  grazing  system,  about 40-50%  of the ground  is closed  from 
October  onward  - for grazing  in January.  Ewes are block  grazed  in 24-hour  blocks  from 
about  the middle  of November  (depending  on grass  supply  and weather  conditions).  If 
the weather  is excessively  wet, ewes are put into the one-day  grazing  blocks  earlier  to 
avoid the grass being walked  into the ground. On this farm the ideal pre grazing  cover 
is about 1800 to 2200kg DM/ha. Grazing  covers above this level results in poor 
utilisation  and delayed  regrowths.  In general  ewes are allocated  between  1.3 and 1.5kg  
DM per head per day, which  is measured  using  a plate metre  before  the sheep  enter  the 
grazing  blocks. Ewes graze a new block each day and are not allowed  to run over 
previously  grazed  blocks. Mating  ewes while in one-day  plots does not seem to have 
any adverse  effect  on litter size. After scanning,  ewes are split into groups  according  to 
litter size. Any ewes that are dry are sold to the factory  (only 3-4 year old ewes are 
given another  chance).
Lambing  960 ewes together  is a mammoth  task, and so it often easier  to split the task 
into two groups. The first group  of 300 ewes start lambing  on March  7, and the second  
group (660 ewes) start lambing  on March .28. This is a much more manageable  
approach.
Single  bearing  ewes receive  1.3kg  grass DM in the daily blocks  until the first ewe lambs.  
Twin bearing  ewes are released  into the lambing  paddocks  three to four weeks pre 
lambing.  Once the ewes are turned  out on to the lambing  paddocks,  concentrates  are 
fed daily in a single  feed. Once lambing  starts, concentrate  feeding  ceases  (depending  
on grass supply)  so as to reduce  the risk of mis-mothering.  Heretofore  triplet-bearing  
ewes  were  grazed  in a separate  group  and fed a higher  level of concentrate  feed prior  to 
lambing. However,  it may be a better  option  to house  these  ewes and feed silage and 
concentrates  10 weeks  pre lambing  (in 2006 about 120 ewes (12.5%)  had triplets  and 
these  ewes caused  the most  trouble  in the outdoor  lambing  system).
Single  bearing  ewes and first time lambing  ewes give the least amount  of trouble  as they 
have nice tight udders  and well positioned  teats. The most troublesome  groups  have 
been the triplets  and older  ewes  with low udders  and bad teat positioning.
After lambing  all lambs are tailed, vaccinated  against  orf and any male lambs are 
castrated.  They are then moved  to a new paddock.  Once the lambs  are three to four 
weeks  of age they are forward  creep  grazed. There  is no silage  harvested  on the farm
106
(except  surplus  grass  which  is round baled as it arises). As silage  ground  is not closed  
up, ewes and lambs can graze more extensively.  Paddocks  are topped  as required  
throughout  the year and 14 units of CAN are applied  after every  second  grazing  (Except  
on grass  clover  swards).
A concerns  when extended  grazing  and outdoor  lambing  was first started  was that a 
proportion  of the lambs would not be drafted  until December  and would therefore  be 
competing  with the ewes for grass. This has not materialised,  and despite  the fact that 
the majority  of ewes do not start lambing  until the end of March,  65% of the lambs  are 
drafted  by September  1, with all lambs  gone off the farm by December  2.
2007 was the first year using tyfon and forage  rape to finish lambs. Four hundred  lambs  
were  finished  without  concentrate  supplementation  off 16 acres  of reseeded  ground  that 
was under-sown  with tyfon. The success  of this approach  will merit a repeat  exercise  in 
the following  years  as part of a reseeding  programme.
Finally, having the extended  grazing  system  up and running,  it is inconceivable  that 
silage  making  and indoor  lambing  will ever be entertained  again!

DAFF participation  in the Malone sheep strategy  
implementation  group
Oliver  Molloy
Department  of Agriculture,  Fisheries  & Food, Portlaoise
Background
Following  the publication  of the 'Sheep  Industry  Development  Strategy  Report' in 
June 2006, it was decided  that a group (under  the chairmanship  of John Malone  - 
former DAFF Sec. Gen) be established  To agree the process  by which the 37 
recommendations  of the Sheep  Industry  Development  Strategy  Report  of June 2006  
should  be implemented.  The Sheep  Strategy  Implementation  Group  (SSIG),  which  
comprised  of representatives  from across  the sheep  sector,  was established  on July 
25, 2006.
The Department  of Agriculture,  Fisheries  and Food (DAFF)  as a partner  in the group  
played  an important  role in the process,  and in particular  a numbers  of areas  detailed  
in this paper. It is important  to acknowledge  that the activities  of the group  were in 
collaboration  and agreement  between  all of the parties  involved.  The areas detailed  
are those  where  the Livestock,  Beef and Sheepmeat  division  had a significant  input.  
Other Department  divisions  dealt more closely  with areas such as the ‘Bond Bia 
Quality  Assurance  Scheme ’, REPS,  Grant  Aid for fencing  and mobile  equipment  etc.
The areas  focused  on in this paper  are:
• Lamb  carcase  classification;
• Mechanical  classification;
• Price reporting  system;
• Plans  for upgrading  the 'Genetic  Improvement  Programme'.
Lamb  carcase  classification  (LCC)
It was widely  acknowledged  within the SSIG, that to attract  the best price, lambs  
must be produced  to the required  weight  and grade. It is also acknowledged  that 
there must be a high level of consistency  and accuracy  in classification,  and that the 
better quality  carcase  should  attract  a premium  for the producer  at factory  level. The 
group recognised  that a high standard  of carcase  classification  was an important  
element  in reaching  an agreement  on the introduction  of 'Quality-based  Payment  
System ’ (QPS). One of the key objectives  of the group was the agreement  and 
introduction  of a QPS.
The purpose  of the QPS is to ensure  adequate  reward  for effort and investment  at 
farm level in the production  of better quality  lamb, on a more consistent  basis and for 
longer  periods  of the year. It is intended  that the system  should  have a three-fold  
beneficial  impact  resulting  in:
108
(i) a higher producer  price  for better  quality  lambs;
(ii) improved  overall  quality consistency  in market  offering;
(iii) improved  overall  image  and the return available  in the market  place for Irish 
lamb.
The intention  is that the QPS would be based  on a combination  of carcase  quality 
parameters  which would be used to make adjustments  to a base price for lambs  
falling  within  a seasonal  weight  range. The quality  parameters  are:
• Carcase  weight  with a seasonal  flexibility;
• Carcase  fat score;
• Carcase  conformation.
Ahe standard  and consistency  of lamb carcase  classification  is looked  upon as one 
of the fundamental  elements  of a QPS. The DAFF gave a clear commitment  to 
strengthen  its involvement  in lamb carcase  classification  (LCC).
Background  to LCC
Lamb carcase  classification  in the Republic  of Ireland  is carried  out in accordance 
with EU regulations  using the EUROP  Grid system. Abattoir  personnel  carry  out the 
classification  of lambs at the majority  of export-approved  abattoirs,  on a voluntary 
basis. Even though  LCC was introduced  in 1996, it was not until September  2005  
that all the abattoirs  involved  used the one system. Currently  there are 7 export  
approved  abattoirs  participating  in the scheme,  which account  for over 90% of the 
national  lamb kill. Carcases  are mostly  classified  using main classes,  with some  
subdivision  of fat classes.
Elsewhere  in the EU, sheep carcase  classification  using the 'EUROP  grid ’ is 
compulsory  in only four countries;  - Finland,  France,  Sweden  and Germany.  Similar 
to Ireland,  Denmark  and the UK classify  ovine  carcases  using the EUROP  grid on a 
voluntary  basis. Carcase  classification  of lambs less than 13kg under  the 'A grade'  
(light lamb only),  takes  place  to a limited  extent  in Spain,  Portugal  and Greece.
The regulations  concerning  the Community  Scale for the classification  of ovine  
classification  was originally  drawn up in 1992 with the publication  of Council  
Regulation  2137/92,  and added  to by Commission  Regulation  461/93  and Council  
Regulation  2536/97.
Supervision
The resources  available  for the supervision  of LCC have been greatly  increased  in 
the last number  of years to meet the commitments  given by DAFF in the area. The 
revised  DAFF staff structure  for classification  comprises  one Agriculture  Inspector 
and one Area Superintendent,  both based  in Portlaoise,  who are involved  in LCC as 
part of their duties. Since mid 2006, four regionally  based District  Superintendents 
(DS) have been engaged  in LCC as well as Beef Carcase  Classification.
Each of the 4 DS's visits lamb abattoirs  once each month  and twice at busy times, a 
target of 15 visits in the year. Since January  2007 to the end of September  2007,  
there have been 83 visits to 7 export  approved-plants  (1.3 visit per plant per month)!  
The average  concordance,  that is, the degree  of agreement  between  the score  of the
109
abattoir  classifier compared  to that of the DAFF  check,  for conformation  and fat main  
classes  was 92.2%  and 92% respectively,  which is satisfactory.  In June 2007, two 
EU Commission  representatives  visited  Ireland  and were satisfied  with the standard 
of DAFF  lamb classification.
Training  & supervision
As part of the revamping  of the classification  system,  DAFF in continuance  with 
earlier  exercises,  held three  separate  training  sessions  at different  venues  for abattoir 
classifiers  earlier  this year (2007). The purpose  of the training  sessions  was to give 
classifiers  a brief overview  and background  to LCC. They  participate  in classification 
exercises  involving  the assessing  and re- assessing  of 50-60 carcases  in the chill, 
followed  by detailed  and opened  discussion  of the carcases.
Also, on a day that a DAFF  official  carries  out a visit to an abattoir  on LCC duties,  the 
DAFF official  will carry out a detailed  check of carcases  in the chill. During  the 
check, carcases  that are incorrectly  classified  by an individual  are identified.  
Following  the check,  the person  who classified  the carcase  accompanies  the DAFF  
official  in the chill to look at carcases  that are incorrectly  classified.  The priority  is to 
‘fine tune ’ the individual  and focus  on ‘border  line’ carcases  i.e. a carcase  that is near 
a class  change,  for example  0+ or R- border  etc.
Legislation
At the moment,  DAFF  are examining  the prospect  of introducing  national  legislation  
to strengthen  EU regulations  relating  to lamb carcase  classification,  and to ensure  a 
harmonised  approach  and adherence  to LCC standards  in export-approved  plants  
throughout  the country. National  legalisation  will principally  be based on Council  
Regulation  2137/92  and Commission  Regulation  461/93. Legalisation  will also deal 
with the practical  issues of running  a scheme,  the licensing  and certification  of 
classifiers  etc. It is planned  to have classification  mandatory  at the larger export 
approved  abattoirs.  The reaction  of abattoirs  and the industry  to the introduction  of 
national  legislation  is positive.
Price  Reporting
It was recognised  within  the SSIG  that an agreed  price reporting  system,  which  gives  
full information  to producers  on prices  achieved  in different  plants  on a graded  basis,  
is an important  element  in building  producer  confidence  in the production  of better 
quality  animals. The DAFF have agreed  to put in place a price reporting  system,  
where individual  carcase  data (weight,  fat, conformation  and price paid) would be 
collected  from lamb abattoirs  and a summary  report of the prices generated  each  
week.
It is planned  that lamb abattoirs  would  forward  data in an agreed  format  at the end of 
each week  to a central  database,  managed  by the DAFF. The data would  be stored  
and processed  by DAFF, and certain weekly and periodic  reports would be 
generated.  These  price reports  would  be circulated  to farm press and available  on 
the DAFF  website.  The proposed  system  would  loosely  mirror  a similar  system  that 
is in place  for beef price reporting.
110
The accurate  and representative  reporting  of lamb prices  is somewhat  difficult  due to 
carcase  weight  restrictions  used in the industry  (no payment  or reduced  payment  for 
carcase  over a certain  weight).  To overcome  this difficulty  it is proposed  to subdivide  
similar  categories  of lamb by using weight  bands  e g. < 18kg, 18 to 21.9kg,  > 22kg.  
The bands  would  mirror the  weights  used for the Quality  Payment  System. It is also 
proposed  to categories  the different  types  of sheep  included  in the price reported  into 
one of the five agreed  categories:  Light lamb. New season  Lamb, Lamb, Ewe and 
Ram.
As there is no compulsory  legislative  basis for lamb carcase  classification  or price  
reporting,  the collection  of raw data is dependent  on the good will of participating  
lamb abattoirs.  The DAFF  have developed  a system  for collection,  storage,  analysis  
and publication,  which is in place since early summer  2007. However,  as abattoirs  
want to introduce  a Quality-based  Payment  System  (QPS) in unison  with a price  
reporting  system,  and as no agreement  has been reached  between  producers  and 
abattoirs  regarding  the introduction  of the QPS, no prices data have been made  
available  for use in the system.
Objective  Classification  Trial
Recommendation  21 of the Sheep Industry  Development  Strategy  Report,  states  
‘Currently  the industry  is using the EUROP  grading  system. In the event that 
mechanical  grading  is proven  to be a workable  alternative  the industry  should  convert  
to that system'.  In light of this recommendation  it is the DAFF  intention  to carry out a 
mechanical  classification  trial in the spring  of 2008. The initial trial was planned  for 
late summer/autumn  of 2007, however due to technical  delays  and lack of availability 
of suitable  carcases,  it was decided  to postpone  the start date of the trial to spring  
2008.
The technology  used to predict  the conformation  and fat classification  of a carcase  is 
Video Image  Analysis  (VIA). The way VIA works  is that the system  is integrated  into 
the slaughter  line, usually near to the scale area. Suspended  carcases  are 
illuminated  and digital video images  of each carcase  are captured  and processed  
using specialised  software  to extract data relating to the carcase  shape or 
conformation.  The fat level is determined  via interpretation  of the colour  or grey level 
across  the carcase.  The image  information  can also be used to make  predictions  on 
carcase  yield.
The pilot system  uses two different  cameras,  one to capture  an image  of the back of 
the carcase  and a second  to capture  an image  of the carcase  turned  90° to the side. 
Carcases  passing  thought  the system,  do not have to be stopped  or held in place  to 
have their image captured  by the cameras.  Following  capture,  the image data is 
evaluated  with a special  image processing  software  on a PC. VIA technology  is 
already used by the meat industries  in a number  of countries  - largely for 
classification  of beef but also for classification  of lamb.
Ill
The trial will comprise  the collecting  of images  from approximately  1500 carcases  - 
representative  of the national  lamb kill. By carrying  out the trial in early spring of 
2008, it is intended  to have both new season  and hogget  lamb included  In the 
sample. A proportion  of the carcases  will be used to validate  or ‘teach ’ the system,  
with the remainder  used to test the system.
VIA machines  can provide  a rapid, repeatable,  automated  and objective  way of 
assessing  sheep  carcase  conformation  and fatness.  VIA machines  can also be used  
to predict  saleable  meat yield from Individual  carcases.  However,  the upcoming  trial 
does will not incorporate  a meat yield component,  as there is no demand  from 
industry  for the facility.
Plans  for upgrading  the genetic  improvement  programme
The group clearly  identified  the importance  and the necessity  for a national  breed  
improvement  programme  that will improve  the long-term  value and profitability  of the 
sheep industry. The need was recognised  to broaden  and develop  the current 
programme  as operated  by DAFF, to include  both pedigree  and commercial  flocks 
(the current  programme  only involves  pedigree  flocks).
Recommendation  6 of the Sheep  Industry  Development  Strategy  Report  relates  to 
the proposition  that the Irish Cattle Breeding  Federation  (ICBF)  should  take over the 
genetic  improvement  programme  for sheep  from the DAFF. The recommendation 
states: ‘ICBF  should  be involved  in the development  of breeding  programmes,  data 
capture  and genetic  evaluation  and should  take over  the Sheep  Breed  Improvement  
Programme  with immediate  effect The data currently  available  under  the existing  
programme  as well as Initiatives  being undertaken  by certain  breed societies  in 
regard  to data capture  should  be the starting  point It is accepted  that adequate  
funding  and resources  should  be provided  to ICBF to undertake  this task and all 
stakeholders  should  be Involved. The additional  work should  complement  and not 
undermine  its existing  role'.
On request  from the group, ICBF submitted  a proposal  in February  2007 for the 
development  of a national  sheep breed Improvement  programme.  Under the 
proposal,  an Irish Sheep  Breeding  Company  (ISBC),  a fully owned  operating  unit of 
ICBF, would operate  the programme  with funding  provided  by the DAFF to enable  
the development  and expansion  of the programme.  The programme  will be 
developed  on a gradual  basis  and will involve  both pedigree  and commercial  flocks  to 
ensure  that the commercial  producers  benefit  from the genetic gain.
It was identified  that a robust  programme  should  be put in place  with clear objectives 
and based  on market  signals. For the programme  to succeed,  a commitment  must  
be given by breeders  to be involved  in the programme  and for commercial  producers 
to use the data produced.  Some of the proposals  include  the broadening  of the 
current  programme  to included  both maternal  (mothering  ability etc.) and terminal 
(meat)  traits. It is also envisaged  that a new and special  relationship  between  sheep 
breeding  and the research/advisory  services  of Teagasc  will be established,  with 
strong  linkage  at farm level with specialist  advisory  programmes  within  Teagasc  and
112
monitor  farms. It is also anticipated  that the latest developments  in genotyping,  
parasite  and disease  control  will be incorporated  in the programme.
The proposals  envisage  full use being made available  of international  expertise  in 
order to insure  the industry  has access  to world best practice  without  the need to 
carry large R&D overheads.  The breeding  objective  is anticipated  to be an economic  
one focused  on the profitability  of sheep  production  in the economic  and physical  
environment  of Ireland. The bulk of the work will be focused  on the economic  
considerations  associated  with establishing  the relationship  between  farm profit and 
trait variations.
To ensure success  of the new programme,  agreement  and support  from all 
interested  parties  is essential.  It is recognised  that a full and inclusive  discussions  on 
the subject  is needed,  to ensure  success  of the project. It is hoped  that agreement 
from all the relevant  parties can be reached  without  undue delay, and that a 
programme  can be introduced  as soon as possible.  In the interim  period,  before  a 
new programme  is introduced,  DAFF will continue  to operate  the current  Pedigree  
Sheep  Breeding  Improvement  Scheme.
In 2007, 144 pedigree  breeders  participating  in the Pedigree  Sheep Breed  
Improvement  Programme,  this figure  is slightly  down on earlier  years. Table 1 gives  
a breakdown  of the participating  breeders  in each breed.

Future  options  for the Talbot  farm
Bernard  Smyth  and Pearse  Kelly 
Teagasc
Introduction
The Talbot  farm comprises  228 ha in Ballacolla,  Co. Laois, Most of the farm is in grass  
with a small amount  in maize  and spring  barley. Fodder  beet was grown  on contract  for 
the farm in 2007, but had been grown  on the farm in previous  years. Presently  there are 
240 suckler  cows on the farm with 70% of these  calving  in the autumn.  All of the cows  
are put in calf to Belgian  Blue stock bulls, with heifers  put in calf to a Limousin  bull. 
Replacements  are purchased  as breeding  heifers. Spring  bom bulls were sold live to 
Italy last year, with the autumn  born bulls being finished  out of the shed at 20 months  of 
age (445kg  carcass  weight  on average).  Autumn  bom heifers  are finished  at grass, at 
24 months of age (380kg  carcass  weight on average)  and spring bom heifers are 
usually  finished  at grass also at around  20 months  of age (320kg  carcass  weight  on 
average).
Current  financial  position
The Talbot ’s have completed  the Teagasc  eProfit  Monitor  for the iast three years. The 
key figures  from the 2006 analysis  are given in Table 1, and are compared  with the 
average  figures  compiled  for 155 suckler  farms in 2005 (All figures  exclude  the Single  
Farm Payment).  The Talbot  figures  for 2006 are based  on a 210-cow  herd - the herd is 
now at 240 cows.

The stocking  rate on the farm is 1.87 LU/ha  and output  per LU is 361kg,  which  wouid  be 
typical  for the system  involved.  The overall  output/ha  of €1,235  is considered  high. This 
reflects  high output/ha  and the above average  payment  that is being received  for the 
quality  of the cattle that are being both slaughtered  and sold live for export. Results  
from carcass  grading  places  the farm in the top 5% for carcass  conformation  for 2006  
slaughterings  (based  on ICBF carcass  report). The variable  costs/ha  on the farm are 
high, while fixed costs/ha  are low. Higher meal-feeding  costs associated  with the 
system  of finishing,  and the greater  use of contractors  on the farm keeps the variable  
costs high. Fixed costs are low in comparison  to the average  on good suckler  farms in 
2005, due to the low amount  of machinery  kept on the farm and the large land base 
diluting  the overall  overhead  charges/ha.
Options  examined
For the majority  of farms the first option  to consider,  should  be the benefit  of efficiency  
improvements  to the present  system  before any change  of system  is contemplated.  
Normally  efficiency  improvements  will yield a much greater  increase  in profit than a 
change  in system. Changing  system  will only offer potential  profit improvement  where  
the existing  system  is operated  efficiently  and the change  of system  does not require  
significant  new capital  investment.  The labour  requirement  of a change  in system  may 
also be an important  factor  to consider.
Although  the Talbot  farm is already  operating  at a reasonably  high level of efficiency,  the 
areas that could be examined  further  would include grassland  management  to get 
increased  gains from grass, the possible  inclusion  of white clover  to reduce  nitrogen  
requirements,  breeding  improvements  (growth  rate and confomiation)  and reducing  
replacement  costs. The inclusion  of alternative  winter  forages  e.g. kale would also be 
worth considering  as a means  of reducing  the costs of keeping  suckler  cows. Options  
involving  indoor finishing  will come under increasing  pressure  due to increasing  
concentrate  prices unless beef prices rise significantly  over the winter period. All of 
these ‘efficiency ’ improvements  when added  together  can add up to over €200/ha  on a 
typical  farm and do not need a change  in system  to be achieved.
All of the options  examined  below  compare  a number  of relevant  systems,  all of which  
could benefit  further  from some  or all of the efficiency  improvements  outlined  above.
Future  direction?
The Talbot's  are now asking  where  do they go from here.
The key issues  they have are: -
1. Should  they remain  with their current  system  of farming?
2. Should  they move  to 100%  autumn  calving?
115
3. Should  they sell the best weanlings  live?
4. Should  they sell all of their  weanlings  live?
5. Should  they join REPS?
To try and provide  answers  to these  questions  a full options  analysis  using the financiai  
management  package  FINPACK  was completed  for the farm.
Options  for the future
All Of the options  examined  were kept at organic  nitrogen  stocking  rate limits that would  
allow the Talbot ’s to join the REPS  4 scheme.  Chemical  nitrogen  rates for each system  
examined  were also compliant  with what is expected  to be allowed  within  the scheme.  
Therefore  a REPS  payment  was given  with each system  and a cost for compliance  with 
the scheme  was also included.  The Talbot ’s would not have to put up any extra slurry  
storage  capacity  over and above  what  they currently  have, or are considering  putting  in 
place over the coming years. None of the options examined  required  further  
expenditure  on fixed costs.
1. Continue  with current  system
Continue  with the current  system  with 240 cows (70% autumn  calving)  and selling  the 
progeny  in the same manner  and pattern  as happened  in 2006. Finished  bulls sold at 
310 c/kg dead. Heifers  finished  at grass at 300 c/kg dead. Spring  bom bulls sold live at 
€2.50  /kg live.
2. Move  to 100%  autumn  calvino
The same  as option  one but all 240 cows calving  in the autumn,  and all of the bulls and 
heifers  finished  with no calves  sold live off the farm (existing  facilities  on the Talbot  farm 
are adequate  for all autumn  calving  - this is not the case  on many  farms).
3. 100% autumn  calvino  and the best calves  sold live
With this option, all of the cows would be calving  in the autumn  and the pick of the 
calves  (accounting  for 33% of the bull and heifer  calves)  to be sold live off the fann for 
the export  trade. To maintain  stocking  rate (and hence  keep output  up) as a result of 
selling  33% of calves  live, the herd would  have to move up from 240 cows to 280 cows.  
It is assumed  the bulls would  achieve  the same  price as those  in option  one i.e. €2.50/kg  
and that the heifers  would  achieve  €2.20/kg.
4. 100%  autumn  calving  and all weanlings  soid live
Instead  of just the best calves  being sold live, all of them would  be sold live. The sale 
price is reduced  by approximately  6% as all calves would not get the same price 
premium  as achieved  in option  three. Bulls in this option  are sold at €2.35/kg live and 
the heifers are sold at €2.10/kg live. Lower weanling  weights  (8% lower) are also 
assumed  with this option  compared  with selling  the top third as in option  three. Again  
with more calves  going at a younger  age to keep output  up the cow numbers  would  now 
have to increase  to 340.
5. Current  system  with a price equivalent  to 90% Italian  prices
116
This option was put in to examine  what effect a better beef price would have on the 
future  direction  the Talbot ’s should  take. The beef carcasses  they are producing  would  
equal anything  coming  out of intensive  feedlots  in Italy. If they were to continue  with 
their current  system  of farming  i.e. Option  1 and received  a beef price for their beef at a 
level of 90% what was achieved  in Italy in 2006 how would it compare  to the other  
options?  The Italian  U3 bull price for the first six months  in Italy in 2006 was (according  
to Bord Bia figures)  391 c/kg. Pulling  this back to a conservative  price in comparison  of 
90% would  leave it at 352c/kg.  The Italian U3 heifer  price for the second  six months  in 
Italy in 2006  was 407c/kg.  90% of this is 366c/kg.
Financial  outcome
Figure 1 gives the financial  outcome  for the whole farm for each of the options  
examined.  Gross Output,  Total Costs and Net Profit are shown. The single farm 
payment  is not included  but the REPS payments  are. The REPS payment  adds over 
€7000  across  each of the options  after  compliance  costs are also taken  into account.
Figure  1. Financial  outcome  of each option
Current All Autumn 33% Live 100%  Live 90% Italian
The current  option  is showing  a higher  profit  than is currently  being  achieved  on the farm 
(2006  eProfit  Monitor  results). This is due to the higher  output  from the higher  number  
of cows (240 vs. 210) and the inclusion  of the REPS  payment.  While  the variable  costs  
would  rise with the extra cows on the farm, the fixed costs have remained  the same.

Moving  to all autumn  calving  would  suit the system  of farming.  Autumn  calves  are more  
suitable  for finishing  in a bull beef system  than spring  calving  cows. This is reflected  in 
the financial  figures  for this option  with a rise in the output  from the farm with the same  
number  of cows (remaining  at 240 cows). While the costs would also rise (especially  
the meal bill compared  to selling  the spring bom weanlings  live as currently  happens),  
the extra output outweighs  this to give a higher potential  profit. The high carcass  
weights  being achieved  with the autumn  bom weanlings  must be kept up for this to 
happen,  otherwise  the benefit  of the high output  will be lost.
Selling  the best of the weanlings  on the live export market  looks the most attractive  
option. These  can achieve  a high price/kg  and the remaining  stock  can be finished  on 
the farm in the same systems  that are being used at the moment.  Moving  to selling  all 
of the weanlings  live is not an attractive  option where sale price/kg  is 6% lower and 
weanling  weight  is 8% lower  compared  with selling  the top third. The Talbof  s would  be 
calving  340 cows for no extra obvious  benefit. The main reason  why this falls so far 
behind  the previous  option,  is that the drop in output  value is not compensated  for by a 
large enough  reduction  in costs. Even though  there are significantly  more cattle being  
sold, their lower value/kg  (you will not get the same premium  price for 100% of your 
weanlings)  and the lower  sales  weights  from the farm reduces  the output.
Including  a beef carcass  price equivalent  to 90% of what was achieved  in Italy in 2006  
shows  just why there has been a demand  for the quality  of weanlings  on the Talbot  
farm, for shipping  to Italian feedlots. If this price could be paid in Ireland  for such 
carcasses,  there  would  be no question  about  what route  to take. Instead  they are going  
to be forced  to sell their best weanlings  abroad  rather  than finish them on the farm of 
rearing.
Conclusions
The Talbots  have invested  heavily over the last decade  in both infrastructure  and 
breeding  stock. They are now producing  the type of animal  and carcass  that can rival 
any beef farm on the continent.  They have the added  benefit  of having  a long grazing  
season  that allows  them to compete  on the costs of production.
From the options  examined  a number  of conclusions  can be drawn. It will cost very little 
to join REPS  4, and they should  seriously  consider  doing  so as no matter  which  option  is 
selected.  It will provide  an additional  €7,000  revenue  after compliance  costs. Whichever  
system  they decide  to go with they would be better moving  to an all-autumn  calving  
herd. While  there is such a high differential  between  what can be got for finished  beef 
out of intensive  feedlots  on the continent  and what  can be achieved  in Ireland,  they have  
the quality  of stock needed  to continue  to supply  these  feedlots.  Choosing  the top third 
of weanlings  to supply  this market  would  be the target  to begin  with. This will however  
require  increasing  cow numbers  on the farm. If greater  numbers  of weanlings  can be 
sold live into this market  without  a drop in price or weanling  performance  (e g. if 50%
118
were suitable  at the maximum  price)  then it wouid make sense  to follow  this route and 
increase  cow numbers  even further.
As pointed  out already,  apart from making  a significant  change  to a beef system  on a 
famn, considerable  gains can also be made across all systems by targeting  
improvements  in efficiency  leveis (extra gains, lower  costs)  to increase  the bottom  line. 
A €100+ per ha gain through  any improvement  in efficiency  would improve  the profit 
levels  on this farm by over  €25,000.
