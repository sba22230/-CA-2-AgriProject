IFA President Eddie Downey has welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney of the opening of the Dairy Equipment Scheme as part of TAMS II. He said it will be important element of the investment needed on dairy farms in the years ahead.
Eddie Downey said that all other TAMS schemes must open without further delay. This includes TAMS for all other farmers.
At a recent meeting with Department officials, IFA Rural Development Chairman Flor McCarthy raised the need to include additional items of grant aid including Sheep Fencing, Silage Slabs and Walls, Grain Storage, Underpasses and Farm Roadways, and Slurry and Litter Storage for Grain Farms. Other issues were raised including costings and steel standard.
In relation to TAMS 1, Flor McCarthy said the end of August deadline is too restrictive and will have to be extended.
In the 2014-2020 RDP, â‚¬395m is allocated for the TAMS scheme. It is vital that the scheme is flexible and that changes are made over the period to ensure that the full allocation is utilised. The investment requirements of Irish farmers must be catered for in the new TAMS so that the industry can meet the challenges ahead.
