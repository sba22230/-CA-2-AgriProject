FIFTH RICHARDS-ORPEN  MEMORIAL  LECTURE
DAIRY FARMING  SYSTEMS  1974
by
D. BROWNE
National  Dairying  Research  Centre,  Moorepark,  Fermoy.
Introduction
Mr. Chairman,  ladies and gentlemen,  it is my pleasure  to present  
the 5th Richards-Orpen  Memorial  Lecture  and I would like to thank  
the trustees  for their very kind invitation  to do so. In this presentat ­
ion dairy farming  systems  which are applicable  to 1974 conditions  will 
be discussed.  These systems  are combinations  of the thinking  and 
practice  of progressive  dairy farmers,  together  with the ideas and dev­
elopments  which have come from Moorepark  and its field stations  over 
the past 15 years. This 15 year period  has been characterised  by many  
desirable  changes  in the whole  structure  of the diary industry.  Amongst  
the significant  developments  have been:(1)  a more general  acceptance  
of increased  stock-carrying  capacity  on individual  dairy farms which  
has resulted  in a substantial  increase  in the national  cow herd and
(2) a much greater  degree  of rationalisation  in the creamery  structure.  
These developments  must continue  if we are to increase  our compet ­
itiveness.
At farm level there is considerable  potential  for improvement  in the 
organisation  of the work load so that more cows can be carried  with a 
reduced  work load. Good organisation  means  good stock  control,  and 
a management  system  whereby  key decisions  can be made with minimal  
effort. To achieve  this a calendar  based system  for the key manage ­
ment decisions  is proposed.
Dairying  on wet land.
The Mullinahone  field station provided  by Mullinahone  Co-op.  is 
being used to develop  dairying  systems  for wet land conditions.  One-  
third of the Mullinahone  farm is classified  as free-draining;  one-third  is 
imperfectly  drained;  and the remaining  third is poorly-drained.  This 
farm is considered  to be representative  of approximately  35% of the 
land used for dairying  in the Republic.  The farm was drained  to Land  
Project  specifications  and a central  farm roadway  laid on the grass sur­
face. The total area was fenced  into four farmlets,  each farmlet  having 
a proportion  of each soil type. On two of the farmlets,  nitrogen  usage  
was confined  to the silage area while on the remaining  two 200 lb nit­
rogen per acre per annum  was used. The milk yields  in the 71, 72 and 
73 seasons  are given in Table 1. All herds were spring  calving;  calving  
commenced  in late January  and in all years the shed was closed for 
4-6 weeks from early December.  During  the winter period all herds  
were self-fed  on silage cut from their respective  farmlets.  The annual 
meal supplementation  averaged  200 lb per cow.

At both nitrogen  levels increasing  the stocking  rate reduced  milk 
yield per cow in all years with one exception  in 1973 on the low nit­
rogen level. Neither  stocking  rate nor nitrogen  level affected  the fat 
content. However,  protein  content  on the high stocked  low nitrogen  
herd was significantly  depressed.  The milk yield of the low S.R./high  N 
group was significantly  higher  than that of low S.R./low  N groups.
This has been a consistent  feature  of the Mullinahone  results. The 
mean results for 1971-1973  period  are shown  in Table 2. On average,  
increasing  stocking  rates on the low nitrogen  farms decreased  pro­
duction  per cow by 58 gallons  or 9% but increased  production  per acre 
by 72 gallons. On the high N farms increasing  the stocking  rate from  
1.1 to 0.88 acres pmr cow significantly  decreased  milk yield per cow 
but marginally  increased  milk yield per acre. These  results  suggest  that 
on this type of land a stocking  rate of 1.0/cow  to 1.3 acres is possible  
with low nitrogen  usage. Where 200 lb of N is used a stock carrying  
capacity  of 1 cow per acre is possible.

Calendar  Blueprint  for wet land.
The calendar  of operations  necessary  to achieve  a stocking  rate of
1 cow per acre (on a 100 acre farm) is outlined  in Table 3. The foll­
owing  herd management  recommendations  are proposed:
(1) calving  should  begin towards  the end of January;
(2) calved  cows should  be fed 8 lb meal (15% protein)  per head per 
day in addition  to ad lib silage;
(3) the milking  cows should  be on grass by April 1, the dry cows re­
maining  on self-fed  silage;
(4) the first paddocks  grazed should be those from which it is in­
tended  to cut silage. The main limitation  to grazing  before  April  
1 is the risk of excessive  poaching.  Serious  poaching  has not 
occured  after April 1 on the Mullinahone  farm since operations  
began there in 1966. When grazing  commences  on April 1, the 
second  round  of grazing  will usually  begin around  April 20. Pad- 
docks are closed  for silage after second  grazing;  it is necessary  to 
close 45% of the total farm area to achieve  the proposed  target.  
At the overall  stocking  rate of 1 cow per acre the actual  stocking  
rate on the grazed  area during  this first silage cut is 1.8 cows or 
livestock  units per acre. It is possible  to carry this stocking  rate 
where  nitrogen  is used without  any significant  depression  in milk 
yield per cow.
(5) The first silage cut is usually  taken around  June 10 and is follow ­
ed by a second  cut of silage from 30% of the farm area which  
is being cut for the second  time. The stocking  rate on the grazed  
area during  the second  silage period  is 1.4 cows/acre.  It is also 
possible  to achieve  this stocking  rate without  depression  in milk 
yield per cow. When the second  cut has been taken the total 
area is grazed  at the overall  stocking  rate of 1 livestock  unit p)er 
acre until late November.  Silage yields  of 9 tons and 6 tons per 
acre from cuts 1 and 2, respectively,  provide  5.85 tons per cow 
which is more than adequate  for the Mullinahone  winter  which  
is usually  about 130 days.

Dairying  on free-draining  land.
Research  results from Moorepark  and from the Kilmeaden  field 
station  owned  by Waterford  Co-op.  are used to develop  dairying systems  
for free-draining  land. The results obtained  in the Kilmeaden  field 
station  for 1971-1972  (Tables  4 and 5) are typical  results  for free-drain ­
ing land situations.  On both nitrogen  levels increasing  stocking  rate 
significantly  reduced  milk yield per cow. There were no significant  
differences  between  nitrogen  levels at the low or at the high stock ­
ing rates. On both nitrogen  levels increasing  stocking  rate increased  
production  per acre. From these and other data we conclude  that 
where low levels of nitrogen  are used a target  of 1 cow to 1.1 acre is 
possible;  where 200 lb of nitrogen  per acre is used a target  of 1.25 cows  
per acre is possible.

Calendar  Blueprint  for dry land (low N).
A calendar  of operations  for a free draining  farm receiving  a low
level of nitrogen  is outlined  in Table 6. The stocking  rate proposed  is
75 cows and replacements  (25%) on 100 acres i.e. 1.06 acres per cow.
The principal  recommendations  to achieve  this target  are;
(1) calving  begins  in mid-January
(2) calved  cows fed 8 lb meal as per P. Gleesons  recommendation
(3) grazing  begins  in early March
(4) the key decision  influencing  the quantity  of silage is made in 
mid-April.  Adequate  silage can be obtained  if 45% of the total 
farm area is closed  for the first and only silage cut. This means  
that the stocking  rate on the grazed  portion  of the farm is 1.69 
L.U./acre.  A yield of 9 tons/acre  from  this cut will provide  4.35 
tons per cow. A second  silage option  is possible.  This proposes  
35% of the total farm area for the first cut and a resultant  stock ­
ing rate of 1.43 L.U./acre  followed  by a second  cut/from  15 per­
cent of the total farm area. Yields  of 9 and 6 tons from the 
first and second cuts respectively,  also provides  4.35 tons per 
cow. Farmers  who are farming  at this stocking  rate should  aim 
to get all their silage from the first cut. In the event of the re­
sulting  stocking  rate proving  too high in certain  seasons  a port­
ion of the area reserved  for silage (15 acres) could be released  
for grazing  and used for a second  cut.

DRAINING  LAND  (HIGH N):
The important  management  decisions  to carry 1 cow -r replace­
ments (25%) on one acre of land are incorporated  on a calendar  basis in 
Table 7. The overall  stocking  rate is 1 cow to 0.8 acres (1.25  cows per 
acre). It is suggested  for the creamery  herd that calving  begins  in mid-
January. The calved cows are fed silage + 8 lb meal per day as per 
P. Gleeson's  recommendation;  the dry cows are fed silage only.  
Gleesons  work at Moorepark  has shown  quite clearly  that dry cows can 
be adequately  maintained  on reasonable  quality  self-fed  silage.

Date of First Grazing.
Too much mental  effort  is used in making  this decision  and in gener ­
al people  tend to be far too conservative  in their attitude  to putting  
cows on to grass early. The advantages  of putting  the calved  cows out 
to grass early in March are:
(1) Milk yield per cow increases  when the cows go on to grass even 
when there is little grass available,  or perhaps  I should  say when 
there appears  to be little grass available.
(2) Concentrate  feeding  can be stopped  so the combination  of reduc ­
ed concentrate  feeding  and increased  milk yields  result  in increas­
ed income  to the farmer.
(3) Having  cows on grass eases the work load. Cows  are cleaner  and 
consequently  easier  to milk.
(4) Lastly, but most importantly,  putting  the cows out early in 
March has no ill-effects  on total grass growth. McFeely  has 
shown  this for the past 3 years (Tables  8 and 9). Three  dates of 
first grazing  were compared,  March 7th, March  28th, April 19th;  
and they were compared  with no nitrogen  applied  (Table  8) with 
40 lb N per acre per grazing (Table 9). In both cases even 
though they were significant  differences  in the amount  of dry 
matter  harvested  in each of the three first grazings,  there  was no 
effect in total dry matter  produced  up to the end of June under  
both systems. These  data strongly  support  the recommendation
for an early start to grazing  on the dairy farm. To ease the total 
management  burden  we would  suggest  that the milking  cows are 
put on to grass early in March  irrespective  of apparent  amount  of 
grass available  for them.

First Silage  Cut
On free-draining  farms where  grazing  starts  early the paddocks  from  
which silage will be cut are the last paddocks  to be grazed in the first 
rotation. When  these  paddocks  are grazed  for the second  time they are 
closed  and fertilised  for silage. This should  happen  between  the 10th 
and 24th of April. This is a crucial  decision  and it is best made on a 
calendar  basis. If one waits for surplus  feed conditions  one will invari ­
ably find that it is too late and that the first cut of silage cannot  be tak­
en until mid-June.  This disrupts  the whole  system  and results  in poorer  
silage quality.  The key to farming  1 cow to 0.8 acres is to close a suffic ­
ient area for silage in mid-April.  If the resultant  stocking  rate is depress ­
ing milk yield then a portion  can be released  for grazing. It is not poss­
ible to do the reverse  successfully.  To over-winter  this stocking  rate of 
1.25 cows per acre on self-fed  silage requires  that 45% of the total farm  
area is closed  for the first cut. Where  45% is closed  the resulting  stock ­
ing rate on the grazed  area is 2.27 cows per acre. This stocking  rate is 
possible  during  the very active period  of grass growth  in late April and 
May. However  this is a crucial  decision  and it is important  that the far­
mer should  be conscious  of the implications  of changing  this percentage.  
If at the stocking  rate of 1.25 L.U. per acre the farmer  decided  to con­
serve 50% of the area rather  than 45%, the net effect  on stocking  press ­
ure on the grazed  area is to increase  it from 2.27 to 2.50. This is equiv ­
alent to an increase  of 23 cows per 100 acres. In some  situations  this 
increased  stocking  rate may be too high and may result  in an excessive  
reduction  in yield per cow. Similarly,  if grazing  pressure  is too high on 
a 20 paddock  farm the release  of one of the silage  paddocks  to the graz­
ing area means  that the stocking  rate is reduced  from 2.27 to 2.08 i.e. a 
reduction  of 19 cows per 100 acres which  in most circumstances  will be 
sufficient  to overcome  a temporary  slow period of grass growth.
Second  Silage  Cut
When the first silage area (45% of the farm) is closed  in mid-April  it 
can be cut on June 1 and followed  immediately  with a second  cut on 
30% of the total farm area. This 30% should  be taken  from that part 
of the farm from which the first cut was taken. The stocking  rate dur­
ing the second  cut is 1.75 cows per acre which it is possible  to take 
without  reducing  yields per cow. When  the second  cut of silage is tak­
en in late July the total farm area is grazed  until late November.  A 
yield of 9 and 6 tons per acre from the first and second  cuts respective ­
ly ensures  4.6 tons per cow for the winter  period. This is sufficient  for 
the Moorepark  winter  of 110 days.
Kilmeaden  Calendar  and Results.
This calendar  method  of operation  was fairly rigidly  observed  in the 
1973 experiment  (at Kilmeaden)  which compared  two levels  of nitrog ­
en (Table 10). The experiment  examined  a range of stocking  rates  
from 0.96 to 1.58 cows per acre. The only deviation  from the suggest ­
ed calendar  was that the cutting  date for the first silage cut was one 
week late and consequently  the cutting  date of the second  silage was a 
week late also. The yields  obtained  where 200 lb N was used are out­
lined in Table 11 where stocking  rates of 0.96, 1.19 and 1.33 cows per 
acre were compared.  The stocking  rates during  the first silage cut rang­
ed from 1.9 to 2.41 cows per acre and during  the second  silage cut 
from 1.43 to 1.82 cows per acre. There  was no effect  on yield per cow 
which averaged  693 gallons.

Nitrogen  Usage
Using 200 lb N per acre permits  an increase  in stock carrying  capac ­
ity of 30%. The use of higher  nitrogen  applications  to further  increase  
stocking  rates is being researched.  In Moorepark  it was previously  
shown  that increasing  the nitrogen  level above  the 200 lb per acre level 
did not permit  a further  increase  in stock carrying  capacity  when bull­
ocks were used. An experiment  designed  to examine  the response  for 
dairying  commenced  at the Kilmeaden  field station  in 1973 (Table  12). 
Two nitrogen  levels were compared  at three stocking  rates. On all 
treatments  nitrogen  was applied  in January  for the first grazing  and 
thereafter  three  of the farmlets  received  1 cwt of 26% N after every  sec­
ond grazing. The total nitrogen  usage in this case was 230 Ib/acre. On 
the remaining  three farmlets  1 cwt of 26% N was used after every graz­
ing which is a total of 380 Ib/acre. The advantages  of the higher  nit­
rogen level at the comparable  stocking  rates of .84 and .75 were non­
significant. However  on the 380 lb N level the high stocking  rate of 
.63 or 158 cows per 100 acre did result  in a depression  per cow and in a 
depression  in silage yield. This information  suggests  that on perennial  
ryegrass  type swards  the use of higher levels of nitrogen  for stocking  
rates of up to 135 cows per 100 acres must be seriously  questioned  and 
the data available  to date would  not justify  a higher  usage  than 200 lb.

The intensively  stocked  dairy farmer  can only keep his nitrogen  app­
lication  rate at 200 lb by omitting  the application  of nitrogen  after cer­
tain grazings. The available  information  suggests  1 cwt of 26% N or 
equivalent  for the first grazing  (applied  in January)  and the same level 
of nitrogen  for the second  and third grazings. Afterwards  1 cwt N 
should  be used after every second  grazing. Obviously  if there  were per­
iods of severe  shortage  this N level may be increased  but this situation  
at stocking  rates up to 130 cows per 100 acres should  be a rare occurr ­
ence.
0.8 Management  Technique
As the 1973 Kilmeaden  results  show,  (Table  12) stocking  rates in ex­
cess of .8 (or 1.25 cows per acre) can be successfully  achieved  in certain  
situations. The management  implications  of stocking  at .7 or 1.43 
cows per acre are examined  in Table 13. If stocking  rates of 2.25 for 
the first and 1.75 for the second  silage cut cannot  be exceeded  then the 
amount  of silage available  will be 3 tons per cow. This is unlikely  to 
be sufficient  in most circumstances.  However,  if stocking  rates of 2.6 
i.e. 45% of the farm area closed,  can be achieved  in the first cut and 
2.04 cows (30% of the farm area) in the second,  then the silage avail ­
able per cow is increased  to 4.09 tons per cow. There are obviously  
some situations  in the south where  this target  can and has been achiev ­
ed by some of our more progressive  farmers.

Replacement  Rate Effect
The stocking  rate targets  suggested  have included  a percentage  re­
placement  rate of 25%. This replacement  rate is higher  than normal  so 
consequently  the targets  suggested  are conservative.  A reduction  in 
the percentage  replacement  rate from 20 to 15% means  that an extra 5 
cows can be carried. A 10% replacement  figure which is achievable 
with excellent  management  means  that an additional  13 cows per 100 
acres can be carried. Using this data the effect  of culling  low yielders  
on the overall increase  in herd performance  can be assessed. If on a 
self-contained  farm, only 15% of the herd needs  to be replaced  for dis­
ease and infertility  the option  of culling  low yielders  by increasing  the 
culling  percentage  to 20% can be considered.  An increase  in the cull­
ing percentage  from 15 to 20 means  that 5 fewer cows are milked.
Assuming  that the low yielders  culled milked  300 gallons  the replace­
ment heifers  entering  the herd must milk an average  of 570 gallons  to 
make the increased  culling  rate financially  attractive.  Conversely  if a 
farmer  can maintain  a 15% replacement  rate he would  be better  off to 
keep his 300 gallon cows if the heifers  coming  in milked  less than 570 
gallons.
Facilities  Required  and Labour  Productivity
The stock carrying  capacities  under discussion  are not possible  on 
the majority  of Irish dairy farms  without  major re-organisation  of road­
ways, paddocks  and buildings.  Progress  in this respect  has been slower  
than one would wish. Any attempt  to achieve  these stocking  rates  
even on small farms without  proper  facilities  can only lead to further  
hardship  and diminishes  the concept  of dairying  as an attractive  way of 
life. The recommendation  to improve  facilities  on a dairy farm is only 
relevant  if the additional  cost can be met from the increased  sales with­
out reducing  living standards. Although  the sum involved  is high 
(Table 14), it can be financed  on a longterm  basis from intensive  dairy  
farming  systems. The annual  cost of providing  these facilities  is now 
less than the cost of fertiliser. It must be looked  at in this light as an 
essential  input. Without  good facilities,  nationally  we would  probably  
never accept the concept  of one man handling  more than 40 cows  
whereas  with these facilities  the concept  of one man plus relief looking  
after 100 cows is a real possibility.  The latter viewpoint  is of course  
not very widely  held. The essential  facilities  required  on well-run  dairy  
farms are firstly a good milking  shed. The Moorepark  open-sided  shed 
with its absence  of steps, doors, feeders  and glass jars will satisfy  the 
requirement  on most dairy farms provided  the shed is built big enough 
the minimum  number  of units per man being  six with the possibility  of 
one man being able to handle  up to 10 when the occasion  demands.  A 
central  gravel or metal roadway  is absolutely  essential  and paddocks  are 
essential  to make management  easier. P. McFeely  is currently  looking  
at the advantages  of 30 paddock  system  versus  a 10 paddock  system 
and to date the milk yield advantage  in favour  of the 30 paddock  one 
day system  is quite small. The high stocking  rates achieved  have been 
achieved  at the Agricultural  Institute  stations  with 10-12 paddocks. 
Certainly  20 paddocks  will permit  a sufficient  degree  of management 
sophistication  for most situations.  Calving  boxes  are essential  as cow 
numbers  grow.
On a 100 acre farm the annual  repayment  of the total sum required  
of £13,300  for a 15 year period  with a 20% grant for a commercial  
farm is £17.14  per acre; on a development  farm with a 30% grant the 
annual repayment  is £1500  or £15 per acre. These  facilities  are essent ­
ial to attain these higher stocking  rates. The relevant  question  for 
farmers  contemplating  development  is whether  the amount  required  
for facilities  can be met together  with the finance  required  for stock.

Dairy Merit
One of the factors  which obviously  has a big effect on repayment  
capacity  is total sales per cow, i.e. the combination  of milk price, calf 
price, and most important  the gallonage  produced  per cow. Walshe's  
experiment  on dairy merit (Table  15) showed  that high merit cows re­
acted in the same way as low merit  cows to increased  stocking  pressure.  
High milk yields  per cow must be sought  as well as increased  stocking  
rate to maximise  returns. At present  milk prices  an increase  of 100 
gallons  per cow which is available  through  genetic  improvement  would  
provide  sufficient  finance  to fertilise  the intensively  stocked  farm. The 
top third of the Kilmeaden  herd in 1973 milked  850 gallons  per cow 
which at the high stocking  rates on which  they were carried  and an ex­
pected  price of 22p per gallon  represents  gross sales per acre for milk of 
£250;  certainly  something  to be aimed  for.

Increased  Stocking  Rates using some Purchased  Winter Feedstuffs.
In the past year experimentation  at the Curtins  farm at Moorepark  
examined  the possibility  of carrying  stocking  rates of 1.5 and 1.75 
cows per acre. The objective  was to design  a system  of management  
which would maximise  the amount  of silage which could be cut from  
these two stocking  rates without  depressing  per cow performance.  The 
results in Table 16 show that stocking  rates of 2.75 cows per acre for 
the first cut and 2.0 cows per acre for the second  cut has a significant
depressing  effect  on per cow production.  The silage  yields  were estimat ­
ed as 2.9, 4.7, 1.0 and 2.4 tons per cow on treatments  A, B, C and D 
respectively.  The shortfall  in winter  feed is supplied  by molasses,  a 
protein  supplement  and straw  diet designed  by T. Butler.

Economic  Analysis
Gross profit figures  were calculated  for a range  of farm sizes from 20 
to 200 acres with a range of stock carrying  capacities  of 0.66 cows per 
acre to 2.0 cows per acre. These data were computed  for a range in 
sales per cow of 130 - £250  per cow. The gross profit  figures  obtained  
for the stocking  rates, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 cows per acre for each of 
the following  sales per cow; £150, £170, £190 and £230 are shown  in 
Tables  17 and 18 for 50 and 100 acre farms  respectively.  From  these  
gross profit  figures  the total labour  charges  and the capital  and interest  
repayment  must be deducted.  This data has been computed  for curr­
ent prices including  the recent  30-35%  increase  in fertiliser  prices. Ni­
trogen level is increased  as stocking  rates are increased. The same  
nitrogen  level of 200 Ib/acre  is used on the 1.50 and the 1.25 stocking  
rates. The data assumes  that the farms  are self-sufficie.it  for winter  fed 
up to 1.25 cows per acre for a 120-day  winter. The 1.50 stocking  rate 
was calculated  at a 140-day  winter. A depreciation  figure of £25 per 
cow was used. The principal  findings  from Tables 17 and 18 are
(1) an increase  in gross profit  per acre as stocking  rate is increased  up 
to the 1.25 cows per acre level
(2) a decrease  in gross profit per acre if stocking  rate is further  in­
creased  to 1.50 cows per acre
(3) a striking  effect  of sales per cow on the gross profit  figure.

•Deduct  labour  + repayment
The effect  on gross profit of increasing  the stocking  rate from 0.66 
to 0.8; from 0.8 to 1.0 and from 1.0 to 1.25 cows per acre is given in 
Table 19 for a 100 acre farm. An increase  in the stocking  rate from  
0.66 to 1.25 cows per acre at £150 sales per cow increases  gross profit  
by £4,542,  rising to £9,206  when sales per cow reached  £230. The 
annual  repayment  charges  (assuming  the farmer  has to borrow)  and any 
increased  labour  charges  must be deducted  from these gross profit  fig­
ures. The figure for gross profit  less repayments  with cows valued  at 
£200 repaid over a 5 year period,  and with facilities  repaid  over a 15 
year programme  is shown  in Table 20. The data assumes  that the 100 
.acre farm is considered  a "development"  farm under  Directive  159. In­
creasing  stocking  rate from 0.66 to 1.25 cows per acre increases  gross  
profits by £1,255  at £150 sales per cow (labour  not deducted).  The 
figures  for gross profit less repayments  for a 100-acre  farm is consider ­
ed a "commercial"  farm are presented  in Table 21. The main differ ­
ence is that there  is no subsidy  on livestock  purchases  for the "commer ­
cial" farm. The gross profit  increases  are reasonable  but the high inter ­
est rates and the short term availability  of finance  for the "developi-  
ment" are making  things unduly  difficult  for "commercial"  farmers.  
The implications  of increasing  the term for livestock  borrowing  from 5 
to 10 years at two values  for cows is shown  in Table  22. At the £200  
level increasing  the term from 5 years to 10 years  reduces  the annual  re­
payment  by £2,409  on the "commercial"  farm.

The repayment  schedule  which a farmer  has to meet if he is chang ­
ing from a different  farming  system  to intensive  dairying  at 1.25 cows  
per acre on 100 acres is high (Table  22). In such a case it is imperative  
that the livestock  money  should  be borrowed  for a 10 year period.
Conclusions.
The attractiveness  of dairying  in 1974 can be improved  for many 
Irish dairy farmers. The cost of good facilities  borrowed  long term can 
be financed  from the profits  of intensive  dairying. The availability  of 
long term finance  is necessary  to accelerate  intensification.  Calendar  - 
based management  plans permit the achievement  of higher stocking  
rates with minimum  difficulty. Higher  yielding  cows are essential  to 
improve  the financial  returns  and to provide  sufficient  income  to pay 
relief staff thereby  permitting  reasonable  time off. With these improve ­
ments dairying  in 1974 and succeeding  years can be an attractive  and 
financially  rewarding  Farm Enterprise.
