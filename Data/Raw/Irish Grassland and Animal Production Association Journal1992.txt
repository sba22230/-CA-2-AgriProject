Altering  the Composition  of Milk  Fat by 
Dietary  Means

Introduction
Recent  experiments  on feeding  whole  oilseeds  to dairy  cows  have  resulted  in 
milk fat containing  increased  levels  of oleic  acid (McGuffey  and Schingocthe,  
1982; De Peters  et al., 1985; Murphy  and McNeill,  1988 and Murphy  et al., 
1990).  Oilseeds  contain  between  20 and 40% lipid and a high proportion  of the 
fatty acids  arc unsaturated  and contain  18 carbon  atoms.  The accepted  mecha ­
nism whereby  this alters the milk fatty acid composition  is as follows.  The 
polyunsaturated  18 carbon  fatty acids  are hydrogenated  in the rumen  to stearic  
acid. This is then absorbed  from the intestine  and it is converted  to oleic  acid in 
the mammary  gland  by an intramammary  stearic  acid desaturase,  the presence  
of which  has been  demonstrated  by Kinsella  (1972).  Thus,  increasing  the supply  
of stearic  acid to the gland  results  in an increased  level of oleic  acid in the milk 
fat.
Milk fat high in oleic acid has two positive  characteristics.  Firstly,  recent  
evidence  suggests  that oleic acid has a protective  effect  against  the risk of 
coronary  heart  disease  (CHD)  in humans.  A diet high in oleic  acid reduced  low 
density  lipoprotein  (LDL)  cholesterol  while leaving  high density  lipoprotein  
(HDL)  cholesterol  unchanged  (Mattson  and Grundy,  1985). The former  is 
strongly  associated  with  CHD  while  the latter  is considered  protective  against  it. 
Secondly,  because  the level of oleic acid is increased  in the milkfat  and 
simultaneously,  the level  of palmitic  acid is reduced,  the milk fat is significantly  
softer  than usual.  This permits  the manufacture  of butter  with much  improved  
spreadability characteristics.  Such  a butter,  high in oleic  acid and spreachble  at 
refrigeration  temperature,  has been  produced  in a Moorepark  study  from  the milk 
fat of full fat rapeseed  (FFR)  supplemented  cows (Murphy  et al., 1991).
The purpose  of this paper  is to briefly  review  some  of the results  obtained  at 
our Research  Centre  in this area of work.
Oilseed  rape
Oilseed  rape is an oilseed  which is grown widely  within the E.C. and 
approximately  six million  tonnes  were grown  in 1990. Generally  the seed is 
processed  to remove  the oil which  is used in margarine  manufacture  and the 
remaining  rapeseed  meal is used  as an animal  foodstuff. Almost  all of the oilseed  
rape  now  grown  is of thedouble  zero  type,  which  means  it has low concentrations  
of both the anti-nutritional  compounds,  erucic  acid and glucosinolates.  The 
whole  oilseed  which  will be referred  to as full fat rapeseed  (FFR)  is high in 
feeding  value,  being high in both energy  (21 MJ/kg  DM) and crude  protein  
(212g/kg  DM).  The oil content  of FFR is over 4(X)g/kg  and the principal  fatty

acids  present  are oleic  acid (Cl 8:1),  54g/100g  fatty  acids;  linoleic  acid  (C18:2), 
24g/lC)Og  fatty acids  and linolenic  acid (C18:3),.  13g/lC)Og  fatty acids.  Thus,  
over  90 percent  of the fatty  acids  present  in oilseed  rape  are 18-carbon  fatty  acids.  
In order  to obtain  the best effect  on fat composition  the whole  seed has to be 
processed  so that the hard seed eoat is broken  (Murphy  et al., 1991).
Feeding  FF^R indoors
An experiment  was  carried  out where  three different  levels  of FFR were  fed 
to cows  indoors  on a grass-silage  based  diet (Murphy  and Connolly  1989).  The 
concentrate  feeding  level was 8 kg/cow/day.  The concentrates  contained  0, 80, 
140 and 200 g/kg  of FFR which corresponded  to a FFR and  rape  oil intake  of O 
kgand0g,0.64  kgand270g,  1.12kg  and  470  g and 1.6kgand670grespectively.  
Four  herds,  of 16 cows  each,  were  fed the respective  concentrates  for a 7 week 
period.  Neither  milk yield, milk eonstituent  yield or milk eomposition  were  
significantly  different  between  concentrate  beatmenls.  The short to medium  
chain length  fatty acids (C4:0-C16)  in the milk fat were reduced  whereas  the 
Cl8:0 and Cl8:1 levels  were increased  with increased  FFR feeding  (Table  1). 
This  change  in fatty  acid  profile  resulted  in a softening  of the milk fat, which  was 
reflected  in the reduced  percent  solid  fatat 10°C  in the milk fat. The values  were  
44.8,42.9,37.4  and 32.2 for milk fat produced  on the control,  low FFR,  medium  
FFR and high  FFR concenuates  respectively.  The latter  value  corresponds  to the 
levels of solid fat at 10°C found in products  (dairy spreads)  spreadable  at 
refrigeration  temperatures.
F'eeding  FFR on pasture
Milk fat produced  on pasture  normally,  has a higher  content  of C 18:1 and is 
softer  than that produced  indoors  due to the intake  of 1 8-carbon  fatty  acids  from 
grass.  However,  the fat is not spreadable  at refrigeration  temperatures.

Therefore,  supplements  containing  275 and 550  g/kg  of FFR were fed at 3 kg/ 
cow/day  for an 8 week  period  between  July and August.  This corresponded  to 
FFR and rape oil intakes  of 0.83 kg and 340g and  1.65kg  and 680g,  per cow per 
day respectively.  These  two treatments  were compared  with a control  group  
where  no supplementation  was given  (Murphy  and Connolly,  1991 ).
Both groups  of cows receiving  FFR supplements  produced  significantly  
higher  milk,  protein  and lactose  yields  than  the unsupplemented  group.  Milk  fat 
concentration  was  significanUy  lower  on the supplemented  groups  while  m ilk fat 
yield and milk protein  concentration  were similar  on all three groups.  The 
changes  in the fatty acid composition  of the milk  fat were  in the same  direction  
as those  observed  in the indoor  experiment  (Table  2). The  changes  were  greatest  
in the group supplemented  with the high FFR (550g/kg)  where  C16:0  was 
reduced  to 18.1^00g  fatty  acids  andC18:l  was increased  to 42.7g/100g  fatty 
acids.  Again, these  changes  were reflected  in a reduction  in the percent  solid  fat 
at 10°C from 40.1 in the control  to 35.6 and  34.1 in the low FFR and high FFR 
treatments, respectively.
Butter  manufacture  and consumer  acceptability  study
A herd of 82 cows was fed 3.0 kg per head/day  of a supplement  containing  
550g/kg  of FFR, on pasture  between  mid-April  and mid-May.  Butter  was 
manufactured  by a batch chum process  on two occasions  from the milk fat 
produced  by this herd and a batch of butter  was also produced  from a control  
unsupplemented  herd. The C18;l content  of the control  and treatment  butters  
was29 and 40g/100g  fatty  acids,  respectively,  with corresponding  percent  solid 
fat values  at 10°C of 42.6 and 34.
The  treatment  butter  was  eval  uated  in a consumer  acceptabili  ty study  (Murphy  
et al., 1991; Cowan  and McIntyre,  1991). This was based on a structured  
selfreport  questionnaire  received  as a result of in-home  placement  of the 
treatment  butter,  distributed  to a judgemental  sample  of 135 Dublin  households

in the ABC ’socio-economic  group.  Only one summary  table is shown  here 
(Table  3). This shows  the response  of consumers,  whose  usual product  was 
butter  or full fat spreads  (dairy spreads,  margarine),  to the treatment  butter  
under the heading  of colour,  taste, spreadability  and general  acceptability.  
The majority  of butter  users found  the colour  and taste of the treatment  butter  
to be the same,  but 70 percent  of them found  it to have superior  spreadability  
characteristics.  Of the full fat spread users 50 percent  or more found the 
treatment  butter  to be superior  in terms of colour  and taste whereas  only 21 
percent  found it superior  in terms of spreadability.  Overall,  in terms of 
general  acceptability  44 percent  of butter users and 47 percent  of full fat 
spread  users found the U'eatment  butter  to be better  or much better  than their 
usual product.  Fifty eight percent  of butter users and 60 percent  of full fat 
spread users said that they would be willing to change  to the treatment  
product.
The results  of this survey  show  that butter  produced  from  the milk fat of FFR 
fed cows  is a very  acceptable  product  with superior  spreadability  characteristics  
than existing  butter.  The extra  cost of producing  this product  in the peak milk 
production  months  of April,  May and June,  due to the additional  supplementa ­
tion, would  be about  14p per 545g (lb) of butter.  This is equivalent  to an extra  
1.2p per litre of milk produced  during  this three-month  period  .
Conclusions
Milk fat high in monoun.saturated  fatty acids (C18:l)  and spreadable  at 
refrigeration  temperatures  is produced  by the cow when  given a supplement  
containing  1.65kg  of FFR per day. Other  studies  have shown  that similar  milk
fat can be obtained  from the cow if full fat soya,  whole  sunflower  seed  or maize  
distillers  grains  are fed at the appropriate  level. Butter  and cheese  have been  
manufactured  from  this milk  and consumer  acceptability  studies  with the butter,  
in both Ireland  and Germany,  have given  very positive  results.

In recent  years,  milk payment  schemes  have involved  milk protein  concen ­
tration  as one of the elements  which  determine  milk price. Because  of the 
declining  value of milk fat, protein  is now more important  than fat in price  
determination  in many  payment  schemes.
Irish milk protein  concentrations
Irish milk  protein  concentrations  for the last ten years  are shown  in Figure  1. 
There has been a decline  from levels  around  33g/kg  in the early 1980 ’s to 
approximately  32g/kg,  where  they appear  to have stabilised  now. Average  EC 
levels  in 1990  were  32.4g/kg,  ranging  from 29.9g/kg  in Italy to 34.5g/kg  in the 
Netherlands.

Figure  2 shows  that there is much  variation  from  month  to month within these  
annual  figures  with values  from under  29g/kg  for some  years  during  March  to 
above  36g/kg  in October.
MONTH
Figure  2 - Irish  Monthly  Milk Protein  Levels
Most  of this variation  is due to lactational  effects:  cows  reach  a minimum  in 
protein  concentration  6-8 weeks  post calving.  Most Irish cows calve in early  
spring and most, therefore,  reach a lactational  minimum  in March which  
coincides  with the minimum  level recorded  in March.  Inadequate  nutrition  
before  turnout  at this period  of high  yields  will further  depress  the level  measured  
in March. Milk protein  concentration  rises rapidly  when  cows  go to grass  and 
this is the reason  for the rapid rise during  April-May.  After that, levels arc 
relatively  constant  for the rest  of the summer  but they start  to rise again  in autumn  
as cows  enter  late lactation.  The fall in November  and December  is due to early  
lactation,  low protein  milk from autumn  calving  cows making  up a substantial  
portion  of the total milk supply  during  this period.
Calving  cows  late in spring  and thus turning  them  out to grass  earlier  in their  
lactation  means  that they  get die lift in protein from  grass  sooner  and the very low 
levels  6-8 weeks  after calving  arc avoided.  Dillon  and Crosse  (1992)  reported  
higher  lactation  milk protein  concentrations  for late .spring  calving  herds  com­
pared  to an early spring  calving  herd.
Increasing  milk protein  concentration
Apart  from  changing  calving  date,  there  arc two strategics  towards  increasing  
milk protein  concentration,  namely  breeding  and nutrition.  This paper  is con­
fined  to nutritional  aspects  but breeding  should  not be ignored.  lncrca.scd  milk 
protein  concentration  through  breeding  requires  the use of bulls with high 
PD82 ’s for protein  percentage  for breeding  replacements  (and even where  this 
is done progress  will be slow).
Nutritional  effects  on milk protein  concentration
1. Concentrate  feeding  level
Table  1 shows  the results  of an experiment  carried  out at Moorepark  over  two 
years. Milk protein  concentration  was increased  significantly  as concentrate  
feeding  level increased.

However,  while  a very strong  positive  relationship  exists,  feeding  levels  are 
usually  predetermined  by considerations  of silage  quality,  milk and feed price,  
and quota  restrictions,  not by considerations  of milk  protein  concentration.  Thus,  
while  concentrate  feeding  level is not an economic  means  of increasing  milk 
protein  the cpmpiosition  of the concentrate  can be altered.  The effects  of 
alterations  on milk protein  concentration  are examined  in the next section.
2 . Protein  ingredients  in concentrates
Protein  concentfation  in concentrates  has little  effect  on milk  protein  concen ­
tration  (Butler,  Gleeson  and Morgan,  1983).  However,  it is often argued  that 
sources  of protein  high in undegradable  protein  (UDP)  would  be beneficial  for 
milk yield and milk protein  concenU'ation.  Fishmeal  and maize  distillers  are the 
only two conventional  protein  sources  with higher  UDP  levels  than soyabean  
meal.
Fishmeal  supplementation  at levels  in the concentrate  from  8 to 13.8%  (giving  
feeding  levels  of 450-966  g/day)  has given  an average  response  of 10% in milk 
protein  yield in trials  at Moorepark.  The  effect  on milk  protein  concentration  has 
been small  and variable  but generally  positive.  However,  with  current  prices  for 
fishmeal  and milk, the economics  of its use are marginal.
Maize  distillers  grains  is a cheaper  and more widely  used protein  source.  
Table  2 shows  the results  of an experiment  where  a barley/soyabean  concentrate  
was compared  to a barley  maize  distillers  one.
Maize  distillers  grains  dccrea.sed  protein  concentration  and while protein  
yield was not affected  in this experiment,  where  maize  distillers  were fed at 
higher  levels  in the concenpate,  milk  protein  concentration  was so depres.sed  that 
milk protein  yield was also dccrca.sed.

Concentrate  feeding  level  in the experiment  in Table  2 was  7 kg/day  and maize  
distillers  was included  at 49%  of the concentrate.  Where  concentrates  are fed at 
this level, it  is advisable  to keep  the inclusion  rale of maize  distillers  below  50%.
The negative  effect of maize distillers  on milk protein  concentration  is 
probably  related  to its high  oil content  (10-12%)  and the resulting  high oil level  
of concentrates  where  it is included  in large amounts.  Including  tallow  in the 
concentrate  (protected  or unprotected)  was shown  by Murphy  and Morgan  
(1983)  to decrease  milk  protein  concentration.  Concentrates  with high  oil levels  
(6-7%)  are likely  to decrease  milk protein  concentration  although  where  pro­
tected  oil is included,  the type of oil may influence  the response  obtained.
Table  3 gives  the results  of a trial comparing  conventional  protein  sources  
with soyabean  meal. The results are given relative  to the soyabean  meal  
treatment.  There  was no difference  between  the milk  production  of cows  fed the 
different  protein  sources.  The cottonseed  fed group  (a high fibre,  low oil grade)  
had a significantly  reduced  protein  concentration  compared  to the soyabean  meal  
fed group and the groundnut  fed group  also tended  to have  a lower  milk  protein  
but the difference  wasn ’t significant.  There  was no difference  in performance  
between  cows fed rapeseed  and soyabean  meal.  This trial showed  that cheaper  
sources  of protein  than soyabean  can be used for dairy cows with only small  
differences  if any in production.

3. Energy  ingredients  in concentrates
The  inclusion  of wheat  as a high  energy,  high  starch ingredient  in concentrates  
was investigated  in two experiments  in Moorepark.  The effect  on milk protein  
concentration  is shown  in Table  4. In the first experiment,  wheat  inclusion  had 
no effect,  but in the second  protein  concentration  increased  as wheal  inclusion  
in the concentrate  increased.

One  possible  reason  for the lack  of response  in some  situations  could  be a very 
rapid digestion  of the wheat  giving  rise to digestive  upsets.  Caustic  (sodium  
hydroxide)  treatment  of wheat  would  result  in a slower  rate of digestion  and 
might  alleviate  any negative  effects  of a rapid  digestion.  However,  in a trial at 
Moorepark,  caustic  treated  wheat  gave no improvement  in performance  over 
ground  wheat. Therefore,  caustic  treatment  is not the answer  to obtaining  
improved  performance  from wheat  and because  the response  to wheat  is not 
consistent,  the inclusion  should  be based  on its cost relative  to the energy  and 
protein  content.
Other  concentrate  energy  sources  widely  used in Ireland  are beet pulp and 
com gluten  meal.  They  have  been  examined  as replacements  for barley  in trials  
at Moorepark  and the results  are given in Table  5. These  feedstuffs  gave no 
significant  differences  in milk yield  or protein  concentration.

Pressed  pulp and fodder  beet are often  used by farmers  to replace  part of the 
concentrate  portion  of the diet  and thus lower  the concentrate  cost  per unit  of dry 
matter. Table  6 shows  that replacement  rales can be high without  seriously  
affecting  performance  although  it did lend to  be poorer.  Where  they were  fed as 
an extra  feed,  which  is the equivalent  of feeding  extra  concentrates,  production  
was increased  as expected.
4. Forage  quality  and type
Thomas  (1984)  reviewed  6 experiments  examining  the effect  on cow per­
formance  of silage  digestibility  (DMD).  The  average  difference  in DMD  was  6.9 
percentage  units  and the higher  DMD  silage  gave  an increase  in both milk yield  
and protein  concentration,  which  would  more  than outweigh  a decrease  in milk 
fat concentration,  especially  as the importance  of fat relative  to protein  in price  
schemes  decreases  (see Table  7).

With regard  to silage  type, there is currently  a lot of interest  in maize  silage  
as a replacement  for grass silage. Phipps,  Weller  and Siviter  (1990)  found  
approximately  a 9% increase  in milk  protein  yield  for forage  mixtures  containing  
.50 or 75% maize silage  on a dry matter  basis. This was achieved  through  a 
combination  of higher  milk yields and protein  concentrations.  Preliminary  
results  from a trial ongoing  at present  in Moorepark  would  indicate  a similar  
increase  in milk protein  yield,  virtually  all due to increased  milk yield. Maize  
silage  can be regarded  as a forage  which  will increase  milk protein  yield and 
possibly  protein  concentration  provided  its quality  is good.
5. Complete  diet  feeding
Where  concentrates  or concentrate  equivalent  make up less than 50% of total 
dry matter  intake  (i.e. less than 8-9 kg/day),  research  has not  shown  any increase  
in production  from complete  diet feeding.  Where  concentrates  make up more  
than 60% of total dry matter  intake,  i.e. more than 10-11 kg/day),  there were  
improvements  in milk yield  or milk fat concentration  but protein  concentration  
was not altered.
Conclusions
Protein  can be incrca.scd  through  breeding,  though progress  is slow.  From  the 
nutritional  viewpoint,  high quality grass silage will incrca.se  milk protein  
concentration. High  quality  maize  silage  will incrca.se  protein  yield  and po.ssibly  
protein  concentration.  Higher  concentrate  feeding level . will also increase  it but
13
feeding  level  is generally  decided  by other  factors.  Later  calving  in spring  results  
in higher  lactational  milk protein  concentration  by indirectly  affecting  the 
nutrition  of the cow.
With regard  to concentrate  ingredients,  fishmeal  will increase  milk protein  
yield  and possibly  milk  protein  concentration  but the economics  of feeding  itare  
marginal.  Wheat  may increase  milk protein  concentration  but because  the 
response  is uncertain,  the cost of concentrates  should  not be increased  by its 
inclusion .
Finally,  factors  which  decreaseproteinconcentrationareequally  as important  
as those that increase  it. Maize  distillers  grains  at levels  above 50% of the 
concentrate  will reduce  milk protein  as will concentrates  with oil levels  above  
6-7%,  especially  in the form of unprotected  oil.

The 1990 ’srepresentadecadeof  turbulence  and change  in the agrifood  sector  
following  the comparative  stability  of the last  two  decades.  European  community  
membership  in 1973 provided  Ireland  with a large  measure  of policy  stability,  
and the wider  international  political  and market  situation  was  reasonably  predict ­
able in the 1970 ’s and 80’s. Now  however,  the political  changes  in Central  and 
Eastern  Europe,  the completion  of the Single  Market  and the policy  changes  
under  discussion  in the C.A.P.  reform  proposals  and the G.A.T.T.  Uruguay  
round,  all suggest  a more  unstable  and unpredictable  decade  ahead.  The greater  
uncertainty  likely in the future,  with the prospect  of movement  towards  less 
protected  markets,  make  this an appropriate  time  to compare  the Irish  and other  
EC dairy industries.
Milk production  cost comparisons
A detailed  comparison  of milk production  costs  was presented  to the Grass ­
land Conference  in 1991 by Boyle'.  This comparison  showed  that Irish milk 
production  costs  are matched  only by Belgium,  with production  costs for rival 
dairy  industries  such  as Netherlands  and Denmark  being  approximately  35%  and 
70%  higher  (Table  1). A number  of associated  milk  production  cost  comparisons  
were  then  completed  by Boyle,  including  (a) the further  addition  of imputed  land,  
capital  and labour  costs,  (b) the estimation  of costs  at standardised  milk solids  
levels  rather  than actual  solids,  (c) the estimation  of variable  or specific  costs  
rather  than total costs.

Milk price compari.sons
While  milk production  costs may be lower  in Ireland  than most other E.C.
16
countries,  this advantage  could  be counteracted  if the processing  and marketing  
sectors  in other  countries  have  an ability  to pay higher  prices  for milk and can 
sustain  these  advantages  over  time.  In this section  the ability  of other  European  
countries  to pay higher  milk prices  than Irish dairies  is analysed.
Milk  prices  may  be compared  at actual  milk  solids  levels  or on a standardised  
solids  basis,  as in the case of production  costs. Milk  prices  are first outlined  at 
actual  solids  for direct  comparison  with  the milk  production  costs  shown  earlier,  
and then the effect  of adjustment  to standardised  solids  is shown.
In the E.C. milk  prices  at actual  solids  level,  ex farm,  exclusive  of V.A.T. are  
published  each year by Eurostat.  However  an alternative  milk price series is 
available  from the annual  milk price analysis  carried  out by Pitts^.  This latter  
price  series  takes  into  account  a number  of additional  factors  such  as cnd-of-year  
bonuses  and is the more  accurate  series.  Therefore,  the m ilk price  data  assembled  
by Pitts,  which  have been kindly  made  available,  are used for this paper. .
Milk  prices  over  the last five years  show  considerable  fluctuations  and for  this 
reason  it was decided  that a three-year-average  was preferable  to single  year 
prices for comparative  purposes.  The price in 1989 for Ireland  was totally  
atypical,  hence  that year  is ignored  and price  data for 1986-88  is used. The milk  
prices  in actual  currencies  for the different  countries  were  first  converted  to £1R 
per 100 kgs using  the annual average  market  exchange  rates  for each  country.  It 
should  be noted that market  rather  than “green ” rates are being used in this 
conversion  so that gains  or losses  in countries  due to positive  or negative  MC  A’s 
and due to “green ” rate conversions  for intervention  prices,  etc. are included  in 
the prices.  The results  in Irish  currency  terms  for each  country  show  considerable  
differences  between  countries,  with prices in Italy 47% higher  than Ireland,  
Denmark  37% and Netherlands  36% (Table  2).

Milk prices  and competitivenes  in processing  and Marketing
In normal  circumstances  the payment  of a high price  for raw materials  (e.g. 
milk)  would  not be seen  as a critical  indicator  of competitiveness  for an industry.  
Important  indicators  of competitiveness  would  normally  include:
(a) achievement  of economies  of scale  which  minimise  cost, and/or  provide  an 
element  of market  power;
17
(b) product  differentiation;  a strong  brand  identity;
(c) a steady  rate of new product  development,  as older  products  move  to the 
decline  stage  of the product  life cycle;
(d) a satisfactory  rate of investment  in R. and D.
(e) a good  profit  margin  or surplus;
(f) demonstration  of added  value  and vertical  integration.
Given  that the European  dairy processing  sector  is substantially  owned  by 
producer  co-operatives,  milk (or raw material)  price  may be afforded  a higher  
status than normal  as an indicator  of competitiveness.  However,  the other  
indicators  above  are also important.
Comparison  with milk production  costs
These  milk prices  paid to producers  for actual milk supplied,  excluding  
V.A.T  at their own farm may be compared  with the milk production  costs  
estimated  earlier.  From  this it is seen  that counU'ies  with higher  milk  production  
costs  than Ireland  generally  benefit  from higher  milk  prices  so that much  of the 
disadvantage  of higher  milk  production  costs  is negated.  For  example,  Ireland ’s 
margin  over  production  costs  of £5/100  kgs is only in fourth  place  in the ranking  
of eight  countries,  being  between  40 and 70% lower  than Italy, Belgium  and 
Netherlands  (Table  3). Germany,  the U.K.  and Denmark  are substantially  lower  
than the others,  being  little more  than half that of Ireland  in margin  over milk 
production  cost terms.  This comparison  can also be made  by comparing  milk 
production  cost  differences  relative  to Ireland  with  milk  price  differences  (Table
4)-

From this it is seen that Italy  and Netherlands,  with  production  costs  35 - 40% 
higher  than Ireland,  have  this cost  disadvantage  more  than fully  offset  by higher  
milk prices.  Denmark,  Germany  and France,  with production  costs  72%,  54% 
and 15% higher  than Ireland,  have  70-85%  of their  cost  disadvantage  negated  by 
higher  milk prices.  Finally  Belgium  has its small production  cost advantage  
further  supplemented  by a higher  milk price  of 14% (Table  4).

Reasons  for milk price  differences
Many  reasons  can be proposed  for producer  milk price  differences  between  
Ireland  and other  E.C. countries,  with for example  the effect  of 12 different  
reasons  being  quantified  in a milk price  comparison  in the early 1980 ’s.’ Some  
of the main factors  are now reviewed.
Milk  solids  levels
All prices  and costs  discussed  earlier  were for a given  kg. of milk  at actual  
solids  levels.  Milk  solids  levels  vary  widely  among  E.C. countries,  with Irish fat 
levels  of about  3.55%  being  among  the lowest  in the E.C.  and almost  20% lower  
than Denmark  (Table  5). Irish protein  percent  is also relatively  low at about  
3.2%, however  protein  varies much less widely  than  fat with Irish protein  levels  
about  9% lower  than Denmark  (Table  5). The extent  to which  milk solids  levels  
account  for milk price differences  between  Ireland  and other  E. C. countries  
depends  on the valuation  of fat, protein  and other  solids.
In this price comparison,  the ex-farm  milk prices  at actual solids  shown  
earlier  were standardised  at 3.7% fat and 3.3% protein  for all counties.  This 
isolates  theeffect  on milk  prices  of variation  between  countries  in fat and protein.

'Actual  protein  for France
Inevitably  standardisation  for milk  solids  brings  ex-farm  prices  considerably  
closer  throughout  the Community  (Table  6). Sizeable  price  reductions  occur  for 
Denmark  and the Netherlands,  reflecting  their very high fat and protein  levels.  
In contrast  the standardised  prices  represent  an increase  for Ireland.  The  amount  
by which the original  price differences  relative  to Ireland  are reduced  by 
standardising  the milk is shown  in both  absolute  and percentage  terms in Tables  
7 and 8. It is seen that in the case of Netherlands,  Denmark,  Belgium  and 
Germany  between  25 and 40%  of the original  price  difference  is attributable  to 
differences  in fat and protein  levels.  In the case  of France,  standardisation  for fat 
alone  accounts  for over half of the original  modest  price  differences  between  
Ireland  and France.  (The  standardised  milk price  data for Italy seem  unreliable,  
hence  Italy is ignored  in this latter  comparison).

In this analysis  it was decided  to make  price  comparisons  at ex-farm  level in 
order  to remain  as close  as possible  to the final  price  received  by farmers  for milk. 
This may be conu-asted  with the very valuable  annual  review  of milk prices  by 
Pitts^ in which  the precise  definition  of the E.C. target  price for milk is taken 
(3.7%  fat, excl.  V.A.T. delivered  dairy),  prices  are adjusted  to this definition  for

each country  and expressed  as percentage  of the target  price.  While  each price  
comparison  is equally  valid for the purpose  for which it is intended,  it is 
important  to be clear  about  the precise  definition  used in each case .
M.C.A's
While fat and protein  account  for some of the difference  in milk prices  
between  Ireland  and other  countries,  very substantial  differences  remain.  One 
important  factor  is the impact  of MCA ’s. Estimated  average  annual  MCA  rates  
for the period  1986 - 1988 are shown  in Table  9. The estimated  effect  on milk 
prices  shows  that, in the case  of Germany,  Netherlands  and Belgium,  about  20% 
of the difference  in milk price  relative  to Ireland  can be attributed  to MCA ’s in 
the period  studied,  (Table  10). While  this factor  was  quite  significant  in the 1986-  
88 period,  it should  be noted  that MCA ’s have  greatly  reduced  or disappeared  for 
most  countries  now, hence  the effect  on milk price  differences  would  be much  
less.
Combining  the effect  of fat, protein  and M.C.A. ’s it is seen that, with the 
exception  of the U.K.,  about  half  of the original  milk  price  difference  is explained  
by these factors  (Table 11). Fat, protein  and M.C.A. ’s are the most readily  
quantifiable  factors.  Other  possible  explanatory  factors,  which  arc not readily  
quantified  are now discussed.

Capital
Capital  in dairy  firms  or cooperatives  can be obtained  either  from retentions  
of profits  or surplus,  from suppliers  (in the form of increased  share  capital  or 
other  means),  or from  commercial  borrowings.  The approach  to this issue  varies  
among  E.C.  member  slates  depending  on national  laws  and in particular  taxation  
law. For Irish cooperatives,  the retention  of a sizeable  surplus  has been most  
common  up to now, whereas  in the Netherlands,  the unnamed  reserves  in a 
cooperative  are very limited  due to taxation  law. The remaining  capital  require ­
ments  for cooperatives  in the Netherlands,  in addition  to commercial  borrow ­
ings,  arc obtained  from members  by means  of a wide  range  of devices  which  are 
interest  bearing  to differing  degrees.  The consequences  for milk  price  are that in 
the case  of Ireland,  the larger  retentions  result  in a lower  milk  price  being  quoted.  
In contrast,  countries  such as the Netherlands  with much  lower  retentions  will 
have higher  quoted  milk prices,  but supplier  members  will then be obliged  to 
provide  much  of the capital  requirements  through  other  means.
Seasonality
Seasonality,  product  mix, market  location  and scale  economics  arc all linked
22
factors  which  are now discussed  in turn. Manufacturing  milk supply  is highly  
seasonal in Ireland  unlike  other  E.C.  countries . Taking  average  monthly  supply  
as a percentage  of the peak as an indicator  of capacity  utilisation,  Ireland  has a  
utilisation  of about  55%  compared  with  a utilisation  of about  80% for other  E.C. 
countries . There  are two major  consequences  for Ireland  beyond  the farm gate;
(a) due to much  lower  capacity  utilisation,  costs  in processing,  storage,  assembly  
and distribution  are considerably  higher  than other E.C. countries;  (b) the 
product  mix tends to be confin^  to a limited  range of storable  products  . 
Seasonality  essentially  is a choice,  and represents  a major  strategic  question  for 
the Irish dairy industry.

Product  mix is aperennial  topic in discussions  of the Irish  dairy  industry,  with 
many commentators  suggesting  that Ireland ’s dependence  on intervention  
products  or commodities  is a cause  of lower  milk prices  and advocating  a shift 
away  from these  products.
Ireland ’s dependence  on butter  relative  to cheese  has been regularly  high ­
lighted,  withacontinuing  butter:  cheesemilk  allocation  ratioofbetween4:1  and 
5:1 over  the last 20 years  in contrast  with  close  to a 1:1 ratio for all other  leading  
E.C. dairy exporters.  This ratio has persisted  despite  an increase  in European  
Community  cheese  consumption  of 43% from 2.1 to 3.0 mill, tonnes  between  
1973-75  and 1990  in contrast  with  a decline  in butter  consumption  of 25% from 
1.8 to 1.1 mill, tonnes."
Over  the last few years  three  main  product  alternatives  have  been discussed,  
consumer  ready  products,  specialised  food ingredients  and commodities.  An 
initial  problem  has been that definitions  of these  alternatives  have  been unclear,  
hence  the following  are suggested;
(a) Consumer  ready  products;  products  developed  for sale to final  customers/  
consumers  at retail  or catering  level.  These  may be manufacturer  branded,  
own or retailer  branded  or caterer  ready  to use.
(b) Specialised  food ingredients;  products  developed  for further  processing  
which  have  a unique  or semi-unique  specification  and arc sold to meet  the 
requirements  of specific  end users.
(c) Commodities;  products  which  are unbrandcd , sold for further  processing  
and are of a standard  specification.  Commodities  are usually  manufac ­
tured  in large volumes  internationally,  can be sold in a variety  of markets  
and often have public  price  quotations.
Ireland ’s dependence  on commodities  has never  been more  fully highlighted  
than in 1990 and the first half of 1991 where  Ireland  accounted  for about  one-  
third of total E.C. intervention  purchases."  More  critically  intervention  sales  as 
a percentage  of Irish milk deliveries  for Jan-June  1991 were over 40%. If the 
home  market  isexcludcd,  intervention  salesasaproportion  of exportavailabilities  
were of the order of two-thirds  in this period.  Given that consumer  ready  
products  and food ingredients  for export  would require  longterm  customer  
commiunents,  the above  estimate  of two-thirds  of export  availabilities  gives  a 
reasonable  indication  of Ireland ’s dependence  on commodities  .
23
Many  commentators  have argued  that this dependence  should  change.  The 
very  comprehensive  review  of the Agriculture  and Food  Sector  completed  by the 
Agricultural  and Food  Policy  Review  Group  in December  199(P  stated  “in 1990,  
almost  70%  of whole  milk will be made  into butter  and 50% of skim milk into 
skim  milk  powder.  In view  of such  factors  as the declining  consumption  of butter  
and the uncertainty  about future intervention  arrangements  for skim mihc 
powder,  the industry  is clearly  in a vulnerable  position.  While  the absence  of a 
large  domestic  market  is undoubtedly  a factor,  the Irish dairy  industry  has been  
out-performed,  both in terms of product  range and willingness  to invest  in 
marketing  a broader  range of products,  by the industry  of some other E.C. 
Member  States.  As demand  for butterfat  declines  and the role of intervention  
diminishes,  it will be essential  that the Irish dairy industry  devotes  more  effort  
and resources  to developing  and marketing  dairy  products  other  than butter  and 
Cheddar  cheese ”.
With regard  to policy  directions  in relation  to product  mix,  the review  Group  
does not believe  that policy  should  favour  exclusively  any one of these  options  
(i.e. commodities,  food  ingredients,  branded  products).  However  they  conclude:  
“There  should  be a clearly  expounded  policy  in the dairy and beef sectors  in 
particular;  it should  promote  moves away  from selling  commodities,  especially  
intervention  commodities;  the policy  should  not favour  new ‘producer ’s brands ’ 
for export  products  except  where  a market  niche  has been  credibly  identified  or 
where  such factors  as control  over distribution  networks  abroad  bring costs  
within  reasonable  bounds;  it should  take the view that ‘business-to-business ’ 
sales  abroad  are the main area into which  most  of our food firms  should  move  
in the medium  term,  building  a base that would  permit  more  firms  to reach  out 
directly  to the consumer  at a later  stage  with ‘producer  brand ’ products ”. ’ The 
recently  published  “Culliton ” report emphasises  possible  opportunities  for 
cheese  in particular.*'
An important  related  issue to product  mix is the location  of markets.  Since  
European  Community  membership  in 1973 there  has been a long  held ideal  that 
Ireland  should  be supplying  Community  markets  with value added  products  
rather  than  third  countries/intervention.  Despite  nearly  20 years  of Community  
membership  half  or more  of dairy  exports  go to third  countries/intervention,  with 
even  higher  levels  in Jan-June  1991 as outlined  earlier.  While  some  fault  for this 
may  attach  to Irish  companies,  it is also  policy  related.  Ireland  is on the periphery  
of an economic  trading  block which  has a considerable  surplus  of dairy (and 
grass  based)  products.  Despite  quotacuts,  this  surplus  has persisted  and proposed  
import  concessions  to Eastern  European  countries  will only accentuate  the 
Communities ’ exportable  surplus.  Basic  economic  logic suggests  that, given  
Ireland ’s location,  European  Community  exports  or intervention  sales would  
come  from Ireland  in the first instance.  This has been demonstrated  in a recent  
tran.sportation  mcxlel  application  to E.C.  and world  dairy  markets.^  From  a policy  
viewpoint,  the implications  arc that  a policy  of supply  management  which would  
bring  Community  production  and consumption  more  into balance,  would  in turn 
create the environment  for increased  sales of Irish value added  products  in 
Community  markets.  Otherwise,  if large  E.C.  surpluses  continue,  one can expxxt

Economies  of scale
With the advent  of the single  European  Market,  major  merger  activity  has 
been occurring  both in European  dairying  and other  industries.  The motivation  
to merge  springs  mainly  from the desire  for increased  market  power  and the 
achievement  of economies  of scale.  Modern  retailing  is now dominated  by large 
supermarket  chains  with about  20 in the European  Community  now having  a 
turnover  in food  of £1.5 billion  or greater,*  and an  overall  turnover  of at least  £5 
billion.  These  retailing  firms wield very considerable  market  power  which  is 
likely  to extend  furthcras  transnational  retailing  alliances  develop.  As well as the 
desire  for countervailing  market  power,  dairy  and other  food manufacturers  also 
identify economies  of scale  achievable  through  merger,  particularly  in the area 
of marketing  branded  products.  Thus  a “Division  1” of European  dairy  product  
manufacturers  seems to  be emerging  which  docs  not at present  contain  any Irish 
company,  (Table  12). (An Bord Bainnc,  though  not a manufacturer,  would  just 
rank as a “player ” in this league  in turnover  terms).  Although  some  Irish dairy  
cooperatives  of a decade  ago have made  successful  moves  towards  becoming  
internationally  competitive  f(X)d firms,  it is sobering  to think that “it would  take  
a consolidation  of the entire  Irish  food industry  to match  the average  sales  of the 
top 40 competitors  in international  food markets ”’. While  economics  of scale
25
may be a factor  in explaining  milk  price  differences  between  Ireland  and other  
E.C.  countries,  the objective  in any activity  is to achieve  the scale  appropriate  to 
that activity.  International  marketing  of branded  products,  some commodity  
trading  and some manufacturing  processes  require  very large scale,  however  
“niche ” marketing  and many  services  may  operate  successfully  on a small  scale.  
Thus small  dairy  or food firms  can best survive  by identifying  and exploiting  
these opportunities,  rather than attempting  to do the same things  as larger  
companies  on a smaller  scale.  With increased  scale,  issues  of competitiveness  
will become  of even greater  concern  in the future,  and international  dairy  
comparisons  as advocated  by Zwanenberg' “ will have  an important  role to play  
in promoting  competitiveness  .
Conclusions
With inevitable  movement  towards  a less protected  market,  both within  the 
E.C.  and externally,  international  competitiveness  in dairying  will be vital for 
survival.  Irish  milk  production  costs  are lower  than  most  E.C.  countries,  however  
this cost  advantage  is counteracted  to an extent  by lower  milk  prices.  Lower  milk 
prices  arise  due  to lower  fat and protein  levels,  MC  A’s in past  years,  and  a variety  
of other  factors.  It is important  that  the effect  of these  factors  is reduced  wherever  
possible.  With  high levels  of efficiency  in the industry  at all levels,  production,  
processing,  marketing,  the Irish dairy industry  has the potential  to be highly  
competitive  regardless  of policy  change.

Building  Irish  Owned  International  Food  
Companies
J. GILL
Solomons  Stockbrokers,  Dublin.
There  are simple  choices  facing  the future  of the Irish food industry,  and by 
implication,  Irish farmers.  This industry  can evolve  to provide  a range  of basic  
food products,  heavily  reliant  on the machinations  of political  and bureaucratic  
decision  makers  in Brussels,  or it can forge  a presence  on the international  food 
market,  being  active,  expansive,  and progressively  developing  businesses  linked  
directly  to consumer  markets.  In this paper  I will address  some  of the obstacles  
that I believe  stand in the way of developing  a progressive  food indusu^  in 
Ireland.
There  are three leading  characters  in this play (i) Cooperatives  (ii) Irish 
farmers  and (iii) Government.  Each of these  relevant  interest  groups  must  adopt  
clear  policies  on the structure  and direction  of the industry  overall  if success  is 
to be achieved.  I would  define  success  as the establishment  of a number  of 
companies  that rank  as leading  international  players  in the products  which  they  
manufacture.  The product  range  under  their  control  must  be present  in markets  
that offer consistent  growth  in demand  either directly  from consumers,  or 
through  intermediaries  such  as processed  food  companies  or distributors.  Unless  
that is achieved  it is hard to see how the Irish food industry  will develop  as an 
independent  and profitable  industrial  force.
Co-operatives
During  the last seven  years  five  Irish  co-ops  have  employed  the hybrid  co-op/  
pic structure  as a method  of funding  their growth  and expansion.  Although  not 
readily  apparent  this has been a  pioneering  development,  not only in Ireland but 
in the context  of the international  co-operative  movement.  Flexibility  has been 
the hallmark  of the Irish co-op  movement ’s history  and that has allowed  the 
sector  to grow  and prosper.  It stands  in stark  contrast  to the bureaucratic  shambles  
which the  UK co-operative  sector  is in. Further  afield,  continental  EC and US co­
ops could  well be under  resourced  to meet  the challenges  of the future.
These  advances  by Irish co-ops  should  not be surprising.  I would  challenge  
the concept  that co-ops  in Ireland  were  established  in a haze  of lofty  co-operative  
principles.  I do not share  the view of some  revisionist  historians  that the co-ops  
were a symbol  of the pure cooperative  spirit. Rather,  co-ops  were powerful  
economic  tools  employed  by Irish farming  producers  to combat  the control  then 
exerted  by local merchants.  They helped  overthrow  a punitive  system  that 
provided  insufficient  returns  for farmers  - straightforward  enough.  Likewise,  the 
evolution  of co-op/plcs  is a development  designed  to allow  overseas  expansion  
by Irish food businesses  that recognise  the limits of depending  on domestic  
agriculture.  That is a legitimate  concern  and further  advances  need to be made  
in that direction.  Bccau.se  of this, I am convinced  that the 51% limit on co-op
28
shareholdings  in the pics will be relinquished  sometime  in the next  twoyears  as 
these  companies  seek  further  equity  funding  to assist  their  growth.  Furthermore,  
substantial  levels  of  pent-up  valueexist  in those  co-ops  with  majority  shareholdings  
in pics. At some  stage  this will undoubtedly  be released.  That is a logical  and 
valid development  from  where  we stand  presently  and one that farmers  should  
support.
In the event  of this happening  it raises  the question  of whether  or not control  
over Irish food companies  will slip from farmers  hands.  That  will only happen  
if these  businesses  fail to deliver  the performance  demanded  by the investment  
community.  In addition  it would  be wrong  to interpret  a shareholding  below  50% 
as indicating  susceptibility  to predators.  Many companies  have  strategic  share ­
holders  with holdings  ol between  10%-20%  who  effectively  control  the owner ­
ship of their businesses.  Furthermore  in the event  of takeovers  occurring,  the 
possibility  of farmers,  through  their coops,  buying  out domestic  processing  
assets  should  not be discounted.
Aside  from what happens to those  companies  on the stockmarket,  the profile  
of the co-operative  sector  as presently  constituted  has ample  potential  to change  
and restructure  in parallel  with the progress  of the pics. TTie matter  of what  
structure  should  be adopted  by Irish coops  has been thrashed  out regularly  over 
the past  five  years. The arguments  in favour  of consolidation  have  been  outlined  
many  times  and I do not intend  to regurgitate  them again.  It should  however  be 
noted that  no less than  45% of the Irish milk pool has changed  ownership  during  
the last four  years  through  a process  of acquisition  and merger.  I am firmly  of the 
view  that  an unstoppable  momentum  is in progress  throughout  the dairy  industry.  
This is reducing  the number  of co-ops  in the country  and it is a process  that will 
continue  in the future. The changes  in co-op  taxation  after  the Budget  will iuelf  
exert pressure  on those co-ops  largely  dependent  on trading  milk, feed and 
fertilisers.  Such  a trend  is the right  one,  because  if we are serious  about  growing  
Irish owned  food companies,  with the ability  to expand  abroad,  they will have  
to attain  critical  mass  at home  to enhance  profitability  and provide  the resources  
for acquisitions.
Farmers
The direction  of the food industry  in Ireland  is aLso quite  dependent  on the 
direction  given  by the county ’s primary  proces.sors  either  through  their repre ­
sentative  organisations,  through  theirco-ops,  or as private  investors  in the quoted  
companies.  The level  of influence  varies  depending  on which conduit  is chosen,  
but it is undoubtedly  a force  to be reckoned  with.
The role of farmers  in this process  is debatable.  Some  advocate  a minimal  
contribution  to the structure  of the industry,  emphasising  instead  measures  that 
will maximise  the price  of their  output,  and minimise  the cost of inputs.  Others  
believe  that it is farmers  that should decide  in detail  the decisions  taken  by Irish 
agribusinesses.  The answer,  like many  things,  lies somewhere  in between.
Many  har.sh  lessons  have  been  learnt  in the past  about  the problems  associated  
with too much democracy  in the boardroom.  The existence  of boards  with forty 
members  and more must be a thing of the past, as it interfered  with and
29
complicated  the commercial  decision  making  process.  Farming  representatives  
on boards  will have to adopt  an increasingly  commercial  attitude  to the Ward ­
room  and this will be helped  by overseas  expansion.  Parochial  political  issues  
will not be relevant  to investments  in the UK or US. As for maximising  returns  
for producers,  there  is no doubt  that  this factor  will remain  on the agenda  of each 
company/co-op.  The vigilance  of producers  should  ensure  that raw material  
costs will remain  competitive.
In addition  to the level  of authority  that farmers  enjoy  in the sector,  they must  
also be cognisant  of certain  responsibilities.  For instance,  there  are two areas  at 
present  where  I believe  farmers  are neglecting  important  issues;  (i) the beef 
sector  and (ii) Bord Bainne.
Almost  two thirds  of the Irish  beef  industry  has been  put under  examincrship  
in the last eighteen  months.  This is by any measure  a dark cloud  hanging  over  a 
sector  that  represents  almost  forty  per cent  of domestic  agricultural  output.  I have  
been surprised  by the lack of response  by farmers  and their representative  
organisations  to this issue. There is a real prospect  of a sea-change  in the 
ownership  of the industry  over  the next  two years,  yet farmers  have  shown  only  
limited  interest  in the subject.  The  co-operatives  need  to revisit  the industry  and 
consider  reinvesting  in it. Many  farmers  will not warm  to such a concept,  given  
the traumatic  experiences  of the co-op  sector  and beef in the past; Cork  Marts-  
IMP, Clover  Meats,  and NCF ’s experiences  were disappointing.  However,  
lessons  have  been learned.  Committees  of over forty  should  have no role in the 
commercial  decision  making  process  and cattle  prices  cannot  be determined  by 
farmers.  However,  while  the co-ops  were  castigated  for their  inability  to control  
the industry,  the developments  of the past two years show the private  sector  
lacking  in the required  skills  too. A fresh look is required.  That may involve  
some radical  thinking  - for example  payment  on the day may need to be 
reconsidered,  given the voracious  appetite  for working  capital  evident  in the 
sector.  Nonetheless,  it is clearly  difficult  to make  money  in beef  processing  in 
Ireland.  A benign  interpretation  of the Beef  Tribunal  evidence  would  suggest  it 
is extremely  difficult  to obtain  a satisfactory  level of profit from Irish beef 
without  stretching  the regulations  surrounding  the industry.  Something  has to 
give in the industry  and rather  than waiting  for falling  prices,  farmers  should  
adopt  an innovative  approach  to the problem.  Unless  that matter  is addressed,  
what  viable  future  can beef farmers  look forward  to ?
The other  issue  is the future of Bord  Bainne,  which  could  potentially  play a 
part in developing  an internationally  competitive  Irish owned  industry.  Pres­
ently,  Bord Bainne  operates  in a form of corporate  limbo-land,  answering  to a 
group  of incompatible  masters.  On the one hand it is used occasionally  as a 
political  football  by farming  organisations  and member  co-ops  pursuing  agendas  
at variance  with the future  development  of the Bord.  At other  times  it is blamed  
for not providing  the guiding  light to the future  of the industry.  This state of 
affairs  is probably  due to the structure  of the business.  Its capital  structures  limit  
the commercial  value  that co-ops  put on their investment,  while  the presence  of 
farming  organisations  on the board limits  the effectiveness  of that forum for 
corporate  dc' elopment.  It is high time that a clear unequivocal  decision  was
30
made  regarding  Bord  Bainne,  for the sake  of the business  itself  and the industry  
in general.  There  are two stark  choices  facing  its owners.
The company  is given  full commercial  status  with  a board  that  operates  solely  
to maximise  the commercial  development  of the business,  and without  repre ­
sentatives  from what are, after all, political  farming  organisations.  This has 
implications  for the corporate  structure  of the group  too. Ideally,  the Bord  should  
be a conventional  buyer of produce  from the domestic  dairy industry,  its 
shareholding  should  be of value,  and tradeable,  and finally  it should  have full 
freedom  to pursue  investment  and  expansion  policies  that  help  enhance  its value.  
Perhaps  GPA  could  provide  a role model  for such a change.
Alternatively,  the logical  outcome  for the business  is for it to be broken  up, 
with the proceeds  being  distributed  to the existing  shareholders.  Its valuable  
Kerrygold  brand would  then be sold to the highest  bidder.  There  are no in- 
between  solutions  on this issue  because  the sands  on which  Bord Bainne  were  
built,  that is the individual  manufacturing  co-ops,  are shifting  rapidly.  My own  
preference  would  be for the first option  to be adopted  and allow the Bord to 
implement  strategies  designed  to maximise  profits  and value.
Government
The other  major  influence  on the direction  of the food  industry  is the approach  
taken  by Government,  through  its respective  agencies  such as the IDA and in 
specific  instances  such as Greencore.
The IDA has in the past outlined  its policy  of supporting  a small  number  of 
strongly  financed  companies  in its grant-aid  programmes.  It is important  that  this 
policy  is sU'ictly  adhered  too, if our industry,  which  is operating  under  a number  
of serious  disadvantages,  is to succeed.  Every effort must be made by the 
Government  through  its agencies  and the education  system  to support  and 
encourage  our leading  companies.  After  all, intemation^ly,  they remain  min­
nows  in the world  food industry.  If that is to change  and if the Irish  food sector  
is to replicate,  say, what the Swiss have done to the world pharmaceutical  
industry,  substantial  resources  will have to be applied.
In regard  to Greencore,  it is presently  unclear  what  stance  the Government  is 
adopting  towards  the company.  Although  the headlines  have  been  grabbed  by the 
political  controversy  surrounding  the group,  investors  are most  concerned  about  
operational  issues and the Government ’s 30% shareholding.  If it is simply  
waiting  for January  1993 before  disposing  a further  tranche  of shares,  it will be 
difficult  for the share  price  and the company  to make  progress  in the interim.  
Preferably,  the Government  should  commit  itself  to its holding  for at least a 
further  two years,  in order  to regroup  confidence  in the stock.
Given  the range  of issues  1 have  outlined  here, you might  ask what  type of 
industry  would  I like to sec developing  in Ireland. 1 want  to sec the evolution  
of an industry  whose  shareholders  arc primarily  Irish, in the form of private  
investors,  farmers and domestic  institutional  shareholders.  This industry  would  
comprise  eventually  of a handful  of powerful  companies  with  interests  stretching  
across many counU'ies.  An industry  that can provide  opportunities  for Irish 
graduates  on one side and provide  returns  for the state in the form of advanced
31
marketing,  technological  and  corporate  skills,  that  can be used  to further  advance  
the sector. These  are the type of objectives  I would  set. However,  it is the 
producers  who  have  a far greater  say in what  typ)e  of food  industry  does , in reality , 
develop.
Executive  Summary
The two  primary  industries  in Irish  agriculture,  beef  and milk,  are undergoing  
a process  of fundamental  change.  In the course  of the past  five  years,  no less than 
45% of the Irish milk pool has changed  hands  through  a process  of merger  and 
acquisition.  During  the last two years,  almost  two-thirds  of the Irish  beef  indusUy 
was placed  under  Examinership.
A process  of consolidation  will  continue  in the domestic  dairy  sector,  a trend  
that  will probably  be accelerated  by the co-op  taxation  changes  announced  in the 
Budget.
Some  of the co-op/plcs  are likely  to relinquish  the 51% holding  rule that 
presently  piertains.  This  will release  substantial  value  to co-op  shareholders  and 
provide  flexibility  in the funding  options  being considered  by the relevant  
companies.
The beef  processing  sector  is likely to undergo  a process  of restructuring  and 
change  in ownership.  Co-ops  should  consider  re-investing  in the sector  on a 
measured  and controlled  basis,  despite  the harsh  experiences  of the 70s and 80s. 
The profitability  of the industry  has to be addressed  and improved.  A movement  
away from payment  on the day for cattle  may be needed  and farmers  should  
review  their stance  on this issue.
The role of Bord Bainne  in the future  of the food industry  needs to be 
addressed.  It has the potential  to be a progressive  and dynamic  force  in the sector  
but its present  structure  is unsatisfactory.  The Bord  must  be allowed  to pursue  
independent  commercial  strategies,  and its shareholding  should  be tradeable  and 
allowed  to vary in value  with the profitability  of the business.
The Government  should  play an active  role in developing  a group  of Irish  
owned,  internationally  competitive  food companies.  Its grant-aid,  educational  
and support  systems  should  be structured  accordingly.  It also needs  to outline  
clearer  commitments  to its shareholding  in Greencore,  if that company  is going  
to thrive  in the future.  A mere  nine  month  commitment  to holding  the remaining  
30%  shareholding  in the company  will not help  to increase  the value  of the group.

A Farmer's  View
M. MAGAN  
Killashee,  Co. Longford.
As a dairy farmer,  my objective  has always  been to improve  the genetic  
quality  of the herd.  This report  is a summary  of my views  which  have  evolved  
over  a number  of years,  and which  have been rearranged  as a result  of disease.
Farm  background
I farm in partnership  with my now retired  father  and brother  on 73 adjusted  
hectares  (180  acres)  of good  land. We have  a milk quota  of over 1 million  litres  
(237,000  gals.)  after  deductions.  When  I started  to farm in 1971 we had 40 cows  
with 27301  per cow and 25 kg of meal fed per head.  We made  steady  progress  
for the next 10 to 12 years  moving  up towards  200 cows  by 1983.  Over  that time 
we reinvested  all farm profits  back into land development,  buildings  and 
increased  stock  numbers.  We had a totally  closed  herd until 1983 when  we lost 
50 cows  with  TB. That  happened  in April,  when quotes  were  being  established.
We bought  30 head  in the autumn  of that year  which,  combined  with a yield  
increase  from  9001/cow  to 63601  gave  us a reasonable  milk  quota.  I also  availed  
of a unique  situation  in our co-op  area  to acquire  some  extra  quota.  In our last full 
year  of production  ending  in November  1990  we had 150 cows  with an average  
yield  of 7500 1.
The one nightmare  every  farmer  faces  is the possibility  that at some  stage  he 
may lose his entire  herd through  disease.  It happened  in November  1990 with 
BSE.  Having  considered  staying  out of dairying  which  was not practical,  I then  
began the process  of trying to plan our future  with a new herd. Due to our 
favourable  quota  to land  ratio,  high  yield  with  fewer  cows  suits  us. We  also  enjoy  
a winter  bonus  pricing  system  from Lakelands  co-op.  Thus,  all year  round  milk 
production  is an option  open  to us. Most  dairy  producers  farm with  a system  that 
has developed  over a number  of years and one that changes  to reflect  current  
market  trends.
High  milk  price  in the past  helped  us to decide  on additional  farm  expenditure  
which  has now to be funded  at less profitable  times.  We have invested  heavily  
in developing  our farm to make  it user  friendly  and we wanted  to build  a herd  of 
cows that two labour  units  plus relief  help could  run efficiently.
When  planning  the new herd I examined  what  was good  and what  to avoid  in 
the old herd. If fifteen  years of milk recording  at an estimated  total cost of 
£10,000 was not to be a total waste,  I had to undertake  a critical  appraisal.  It is 
worth  noting  that some  countries  have discipline  imposed  on their producers  
whereby  all second  calf  animals  are mated  to test sires.  This  gives  a large  number  
of new  bulls  to select  from  each  year.  The  marketing  strategy  of some  A. I. groups  
at present  seems  to be the sale and distribution  of other  counties ’ semen.  This,  
plus a plethora  of semen  selling  groups/companies,  means  that millions  of 
pounds  are leaving  our dairy industry  each year. This money  is needed  for the
33
development  of a native  bull programme.  High semen  costs  are based  largely  on 
fashion  followed  by the proceeds  of the sale  of ‘Mr. Right  Bull'  into  the promotion  
of the next sufter  bull. The old Irish saying,  ‘Ta adharca  fada ar na bolacht  thar 
lar’ or ‘far away  bulls have long horns ’ was never  more  apt.
Our plan for the future  is to concentrate  on full milk  production  but at as low 
a cost  as possible,  by using  more  grass  and by producing  better  silage  from both  
grass  and maize
As we strive  to reduce  costs  of producing  milk,  essential  costs  such  as, semen  
must  be tightly  controlled.
While  I acknowledge  the importance  of our beef  industry,  it has been  used  for 
far too long  for holding  up the process  of developing  a meaningful  dairy  bull list. 
In the past bulls have been rejected  if their beef shape  failed to meet certain  
criteria  despite  the fact that they were very good for milk production.  I have  
always  been  sceptical  about  the term ‘dual purpose  bull’. To me this implies  only 
half good  enough  at either  job. We all know  of a case of a heifer  breed  for beef 
which  found  its way into the dairy  herd and performed  well. But this cannot  be 
replicated  on a widespread  basis.  Fixing  type  is very  difficult  at the best  of times  
but it is further  complicated  when  breeds  are mixed.  The choice  of a beef  bull is 
ever  present  for any of us at any time but we should  strive  to develop  a generic  
single  purpose  breed  to help us maximise  our efficiency.
Milk recording
Central  to any successful  young  sire test programme  is the need  for having  a 
realistic  percentage  of the national  herd  recorded.  Our  pitifully  low figure  of less 
than 10% is only matched  by the non dairying  mediterranean  countries.  Any 
single  farmer  can make  a case  not to record  but that is leaving  the work  to others.  
We must  find  a way  to reduce  the cost  of m ilk recording  and to attract  more  people  
into the scheme.  I commend  Dairy Gold  on their  promotion  of the ‘ A8’ scheme  
to their  suppliers.  This scheme  is within  5% accuracy  of the more  widely  used 
‘ A4’ scheme.  The  efforts  of a large  dairy  co-op  in increasing  the number  of cows  
recorded  must  be applauded.
In summary,  herd  performance  is progressing  nicely. Fat and protein  produc ­
tion hasaveraged  3.8% fat,  3.35%  protein  for the winter,  giving  usabonus  of 0.9p 
per 1 (4p per gal) in addition  to our winter  bonus  of 4.4p per 1 (20p/gal).
We are using  maize  silage  in the diet but at 20% dry matter,  it may not be 
contributing  anything.  In 1989/90  we brought  in 70 first calved  heifers  into the  
herd,  35 in the spring  and 35 in the autumn.  The  autumn  calving  heifers  averaged  
7300  kg at 3.63%  fat and 3.43% protein,  with the spring  calvers  yielding  6000  kg 
at 3.6% fat and 3.25% protein.  Within  this group  of heifers  we had a wide  range  
of indices  ranging  from  450 to 805. With  very few exceptions  the best  heifers  on 
yield  of milk,  fat and protein  were  the high index  ones.  We had a top yield  of9200  
kg at 3.75%  fat and 3.3%  protein  while  the highest  index  heifer  produced  8000  
kg at 4.14%  fat and 3.66%  protein.  She was also the best looking  heifer  and had 
been  contracted  as a bull mother  for A.1. All animals  received  equal  treatment  as 
we feed the herd on a complete  diet.
The  case  is well  proven  that  h igh index  cows  arc more  efficient  under  any level
34
of input  or management  system  than  cows  of low genetic  merit.  The  long  running  
experiment  at Langhill  in Scotland  proves  this conclusively.  If each index point  
is worth  an extra £1 in profitability  1 believe  that it is necessary  to build the 
highest  index  herd  possible.  We as farmers  use science  as a management  aid in 
many  ways on the farm but have virtually  ignored  it when it comes  to cattle  
breeding.  To me that  is illogical.  1 am also  convinced  that high  index  cows  do not 
necessarily  mean  that we lose functional  type.
1 regret  the lack of a meaningful  genetic  evaluation  trial in this country.  We 
enjoy  the excellent  work  done  by two of the leading  Dairy  Research  Centres  in 
the world  - Moorepark  and Hillsborough.  But unfortunately  very little research  
has gone into this vital area of genetic  improvement.  Nonetheless  I accept  the 
results  of the international  R & D work  on animal  breeding.  So, the challenge  was 
to locate  animals  with superior  breeding.
What  I look for in a cow
1. Functional  type with good  dairy  character,  good legs and feet
2. Capacity  - to facilitate  forage  utilisation
3. Sound  udders  with teats pointing  down
4. Capable  of high production
She must  have her first calf at 2 years  of age, produce  a calf every  year and 
be retained  in the herd long enough  to reproduce  her own replacement.
As we are paid 55% of our milk price  on a protein  basis  we were  determined  
to place  a lot of emphasis  on protein  in the new herd. While  it may be possible  
to influence  protein  percentage  in milk with certain  feeding  practices  it is 
important  to have a good protein  base to start with.  This presented  us with our 
first problem  where  to get good protein  cows  in Ireland?
The very  low number  of cows  milk recorded  in this country  left us with very  
few options.  We located  a small number  of animals  here but if we were to 
complete  the herd with Irish cows  we would  have to compromise  our aims and 
objectives.  After  looking  at a number  of countries,  Denmark  and Canada  were  
the two main sources  from which  I selected  the foundation  of the new herd.
Denmark  has an excellent  disease  free status which means there is no 
quarantine  for cattle  coming  from that country.  Thus,  it was the only country  in 
Europe  that could  compete  on a price basis with Ireland.  Most dairy cows in 
Denmark  are milk recorded  which  gives  a large  selection  of animals  to choose  
from. I selected  106 in-calf  heifers  from Denmark,  the first of which  were  due 
to calve  shortly  after  arrival  in Ireland  in May. Most  of the animals  came  from  
small farms but I felt that they would fit in with our system.  The average  
production  of the dams  which  we selected  in Denmark  was 7400  kgs at 4.00%  
fat and 3.4%  protein.
In Canada  we looked  for cows  that were  a little  different.  We were  aiming  at 
top north  American  genetic  merit,  selected  for depth  of pedigree,  high produc ­
tion, excellent  type  and high index,  in other  words  the complete  package.
The Canadian  group  have formed  the nucleus  herd within  the larger  unit. A 
selected  number  of animals  from the larger  herd are being used as embryo
35
recipients.  We are flushing  the best of the Canadian  cows  to the best available  
bulls  to speed  up genetic  progress  and also to capitalise  on the high investment  
incurred  therein.  We also have  a store  of U.S.A.  embryos  contracted  from some  
of the best  cows  identified  by the U.S. Department  of Agriculture.  This was the 
project  we had embarked  on before  we lost the last herd and unfortunately  the 
first crop was lost when  the herd was disposed  of in November  1990.
Returning  to the subject  of top bull, I await  eagerly  the time when we can 
compare  bulls from different  countries  on a unified  standard  basis.  At present  
‘Top Bull ’ means  a very expensive  bull. I aim fora  bull with  a high RBI of 140 
plus, plus for percentage  protein,  has an acceptable  type scoring  but most  
importantly  has a wide  proof  or a big weighting.  The best way to measure  the 
success  of a national  breeding  programme  is in its international  semen  sales.  
Using this simple  measurement,  the most succesful  countries  are U.S.A.,  
Canada,  Holland,  France,  Germany,  Denmark  and New Zealand,  while  North  
American  genetics  are enjoying  tremendous  success  at present,  I believe  their 
position  will be challenged  by Continental  Europe.
Where  does  all of this leave  Ireland?  I won ’t dwell  on the past  except  to note 
our dismal  performance  in developing  a bull,  even  one bull that can compete  in 
the international  arena.  We must now decide  where  we are going  in the future.  
The  recently  proposed  merger  of the A.l. bodies  into two groups  must  be matched  
by a well defined  disciplined  programme  to test a large number  of bulls for 
extensive  home  use at least  and international  sales  at best. In taking  a leaf  out of 
other  counU'ies  breeding  programmes  I feel that it is vital  to test  bulls  out of cows  
that perform  in an environment  and on a system  that their  daughters  are likely  to 
perform  under.
After  ten months  back  into production  we obtained  a yield  of6000  kg per cow 
- concenuate  usage  was high as the Danish  cows needed  supplementation  at 
grass.  I think  this was  just  a start  up, stress  related  problem  which  I hope  will not 
re-occur  in the coming  season.  The  smaller  nucleus  herd  is performing  very  well 
and looks  set to out-yield  their herd mates  by 20%.  The only concession  made  
to this herd is that they are housed  in a small group to eliminate  space  
competition.

Application  of New Zealand  Dairying  
Techniques  to Irish Conditions
R. RAYNE  and S. HOLMES  
Teagasc,  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
We are two Consulting  Officers  for the New  Zealand  Dairy  Board  working  
in Munster,  funded  by Dairy  Gold,  Golden  Vale  and Kerry  co-ops  with the aim  
of helping  to put more  money  in Irish dairy farmers  pockets.
We’ve found farmers  here  to be very  aware  of the need  to lift farm efficiency  
and to maintain  their  standard  of living  but not so sure on where  to start  or how 
far to go. Much  of the current  focus  of farmers  is on quota,  CAP  and tax, i.e. 
factors  outside  of their control.  Many farmers  are not focusing  on their core 
business;  they  do not have  a clear  objective  of maximising  profit  from their  dairy  
enterprise.
Wide  variation  in costs
NZ farmers  rely solely  on unstable  world  prices,  hence  they must always  
maximise  margins  to survive  when  milk price  is low. Like  Ireland,  NZ depends  
primarily  on grass  to produce  milk.  Within  Ireland  there  is an enormous  range  
in costs from 40 to 90p/gal.  with most farmers  producing  milk at 60-65p/gal.  
Ireland  produces  1000 million  gallons  of milk annually.  A lOp/gal.  saving  on 
farm  costs  would  put an additional  £100  million  pounds  in farmers  pockets.  The 
priority  for most farmers  should  be to lift efficiency  to the level of the best 
operators,  by using  existing  Irish technology.
NZ is producing  milk at a cost of around  18p/gal.  Most  of the difference  
between  Ireland  and NZ are not due to climate  but to the focus  on profit.  The 
entire  NZ industry  has an unshakeable  belief  in low  cost  production  and the key 
principles  that lead to low cost production.  There  is on going research  plus 
extensive  measurement  on farms,  reinforcing  those  key principles  and guiding  
management.
Discussion  groups
One  of the cornerstones  of the NZ dairy  indusU'y  is it’s extension  service,  the 
success  of which is partly  reflected  in the narrow  range  of production  costs.  What  
is extension?  Broadly  speaking,  extension  is helping  people  to help  themselves.  
In NZ the role  of a Consulting  Officer  is to help  lift farm  profit.  We do this mainly  
by working  with farmer  discussion  groups  and focusing  on the key principles  of 
low cost production  .
Discussion  groups  arc a vital extension  method  in NZ. Over 50% of dairy  
farmers  attend  one or more  discussion  groups.  They  enable  each CO to contact,  
on average,  350 farmers  regularly,  providing  a low-cost  and effective  extension  
service  to farmers.
The NZ discussion  group  may be and probably  is fundamentally  different  to
38
the discussion  groups  operating  here in Ireland.  Some  of the key points  that in 
NZ have made  discussion  groups  so successful  are:
* FARMERS  GROUPS:  The farmers  are responsible  for organising  meet ­
ings, activities  and attendance.  It is not a closed  group,  anyone  in the area can 
attend  though  the groups  tend to remain  stable.
* MANAGEMENT  MEETINGS:  They  meet  once  per  month,  during  the day, 
on a farm.  The  farmer  attends  the discussion  group  to help  his business.  Meeting  
during  the day keeps  the group  calibrated  on measurement.
* ROTATING  VISITS:  The group  visits  a different  member  each time.  The 
host  farmer  sets the objectives  for the day. Issues  relevant  to the whole  group  are 
discussed  based  around  the host farm situation.
* OBJECTIVES:  The group  helps define  objectives  more clearly,  gives  
options  and opinions  so that at the end of the day the farmers  make  their own 
decisions  and understand  the basis  for them.
♦DISCUSSION:  The  CO is not there  as an‘expert ’ to give  a lecture  or answer  
farmers  questions;  the ideas  are nearly  always  within  the group.  The CO helps  
keep the discussion  focused  on the key principles  that affect  profit,  adding  
technical  information  where  necessary.  The  group  focuses  on relevant  issues  for 
the time  of year,  for example,  submission  rates and non-return  rates at mating,  
cow  condition  scoring  and feed  budgeting  in the autumn,  grass  dry matter  intake  
and utilisation  throughout  the year.
* ANALYSIS:  The CO helps  the group  analyse  all options,  relating  them  
back  to profit.  Farmers  develop  an ability  to analyse  better  any situation  on their  
farm.
The discussion  group  concept  has been very  successful  in NZ at encouraging  
and helping  farmers  increase  profitability.  As adults  we are self-directed  learn ­
ers, i.e. adult  learning  is initiated,  planned,  directed  and carried  out  by ourselves.  
Professionals  have a relatively  small influence  on farmers  decision  making.  
Other  farmers  are pxtssibly  the most  influential  social  group  for a farmer.
To lift profit  there must be a clear farm objective,  be focused  on the dairy  
enterprise  and understand  the key principles  of efficient  dairy farming.  To 
achieve  this objective  a good  discussion  group  helps  farmers  very significantly.
Key principles
The major  difference  in dairy  technology  between  Ireland  and New  Zealand  
is NZ’s focus  on the farm as a business  and on the key principles  of low cost 
dairying.  We believe  that in Ireland  a similar  focus  on these  critically  important  
principles  would  put more money  into farmers  pockets.  What are the key 
principles  of turning  grass  to milk  at low cost?  They  are: stocking  rate,  calving  
date, cow genetic  merit  and grazing  management.
These  principles  which were  developed  under  the very favourable  conditions  
of Ruakura  have, over the last decade,  been  proven  to be equally  as valid  in the 
cold South  Island  of NZ where  climatic  conditions  arc generally  similar  to the 
south  of Ireland.  The principles  do not change  with  the weather,  soil type  or any
39
other  variable.  We realise  that this winter  has been unusually  mild,  but every ­
thing  we know  about  Ireland  suggests  strongly  to us that these  key principles  are 
just  as relevant  here.  There  is enormous  scope  to increase  profits  on dairy  farms.  
The most  efficient  farmers  here  are producing  milk  at around  40p  per gal. We are 
convinced  that under  normal  Irish conditions  milk  can be produced  at 25p/gal.
How  much  does  it cost  to produce  a gallon  of milk?  Do you know  what  your  
farm profit  margin  is or where  it disappiears  to? Do you really  have a clear  
objective  of maximising  profit  and a strategic  plan  to achieve  that?  Many  farmers  
seem  to concentrate  on increasing  output,  avoiding  tax and end up losing  control  
of costs.
In any business  there  must  bea  clear  objective  of maximising  profit.  Y  ou want  
to build  on your  assets  each year  to provide  a better  quality  of life for yourselves  
and the next  generation.  That  means  re-investing  time  and  profit  in areas  that  will 
give the best return and turning  grass to milk at lowest  cost. To reach this 
objective,  there  must  be a clear  management  strategy.  That  management  strategy  
should  be:
1. Analyse  current  performance  - compare  yourself  with the efficient  farmers.  
What  are your costs of production?  What is your income:  What is your real 
margin?  If you don’t know how to do this, seek help from your advisor  or 
accountant.
Dairy  mis  data  here  show  that farmers  with  lower  costs  of production  are more  
efficient  than average  in all areas i.e. they have better  financial  control  of the 
business.  Tax accounts  provide  very  little  management  information.  NZ farmers  
regularly  make and use cashflows  and budgets  to monitor  and control  their  
business.
2. Concentrate  on the key principles  of low cost production  which are; 
stocking  rate, calving  date and pattern,  cow genetic  merit  and grazing  manage ­
ment.  Use objective  measurement  to monitor  yourself  against  your  targets.  The 
more  grass  used,  the less meal  fed and  the less silage  fed, hence  less to replace.  
High  grass  utilisation  at low cost is dependant  on an adequate  stocking  rate and 
a compact  calving  close  to grass.
Grass  utilisation
How  do you know  how well you’re utilising  grass? The pasture  management  
we observed  last autumn  throughout  Ireland  was succeeding  mostly  in minimis ­
ing growth.  For most  farmers  the aim seemed  to be how soon  could  the farm  be 
grazed  out. The  aim should  have  been  how  to continue  to provide  and utilise  good  
grass  for the cows  to reduce  costs.  The  next  aim should  then have  been  preparing  
for early turnout.
NZ farmers  use simple  techniques,  such as, grass  assessment  and condition  
scoring  to assess  what  is happening  on the farm.  Action  is then taken  to ensure  
pasture  and feeding  targets  are met. These  techniques  would  apply  equally  to 
Ireland.  Grass  assessment  means  measuring  grass  cover  using,  for example,  an 
electronic  probe  or plate meter.  These  indicate  kilograms  of grass dry matter  
available,  grass  growth  rates,  and grass left after grazing,  hence  utilisation.
As a balance,  cows  arc regularly  condition  scored  to ensure,  firstly , that  young
40
cows  dry off  early  enough  to reach  Irish  score  3 before  calving,  and secondly,  that 
the feeding  level  is maintaining  the condition  of older  cows  at around  score  2.5 
up to calving.  Expensive  winter  feed is wasted  on overfat  cows  and  by not giving  
priority  to young  cows  which  could  give a payback  on extra  condition.
Calving  date
While  stocking  rate determines  how much  grass  is eaten,  calving  date and 
pattern  determine  when  it is eaten.
In Ireland  milk bonuses  and the chase for extra money  from beef calves  
confuses  farmer  thinking.  An example  of this is the Curtins  farm trial, where  a 
later  calving  close  to grass  lifted  profits  by a whopping  lOp/gal.  Yet few farmers  
are making  a significant  effort  to do this. Reasons  given  for not calving  closer  to 
grass  are usually:
- loss of milk bonuses,
- lower  calf prices,
- worry  about  late calvers  going  even later.
Many  farmers  begin  calving  in January  and are still calving  cows in April,  
May  or even  J une.  Few  are actually  analysing  their  situation  to see if later  calving  
will lift profits  on the farm,  or examining  why the calving  is spread,  or, how a 
compact  calving  pattern  can be achieved.  Moorepark  has researched  and 
developed  practical  systems  for getting  cows in calf compactly.
Compact calving
In NZ mating  time for the herd is one of, if not the most  important,  period  in 
farm management  Compact  calving  close to grass matches  grass supply  and 
demand  more  closely  and, as Curtins  farm has shown,  lifts profit.  Achieving  a 
compact  calving  takes  time and effort.  Good  calving  records  will help,  and for 
example,  recording  all heats  for 3-4 weeks  prior  to maung  will show  up problems  
before  mating  commences.  NZ farmers  aim to have  a 90%+  submission  rate  and 
a 70% conception  rate. They monitor  and record  exactly  what is happ)ening  
throughout  this p)eriod.
NZ researchers  have also researched  and develop)ed  practical  systems  for 
getting  cows  in-calf  comp)actly.  In contrast  to Ireland,  these  techniques  have  been  
taken up  by the majority  of commercial  farmers.  Tailpainting  is a good  example,  
simple  and highly  effective  if used propterly.  Ninety  ptercent  of NZ farmers  use 
tailpaint  compared  with 10% of Irish farmers.  The net result  is that in NZ the 
majority  of farmers  will target  and succeed  in having  a compact  calving.
Breeding  policy  on the farm
The two objectives  of mating  are:
a. Getting  cows  in-calf  on time;
b. Breeding  sufficient  high RBI replacements.
Far too few cows  in Ireland  are mated  to high  RBI  sires  because  of a pjcrceived  
drop  in value  of the calf  and the p)crcei  vcd lack  of benefits  under  a quota  situation.  
Replacement  rates and use of high RBI sires is so low that the national  herd is 
probably  going  backwards.  In addition,  milkfat  and protein  pxMcentages  have
41
changed  little  in Ireland,  while  the rest of European  fanners  have  been  success ­
fully breeding  to increase  the value  of their milk.
In the chase  for a few extra  pence  per gallon  from calf and beef  sales,  costs  
are driven  up and income  driven  down  by inefficient  cows.  Profit  is suffering  and 
the trend  according  to Al usage  last season  is still downwards.
Calf  and cull sales  in Ireland  contribute  the same  proportion  to dairy  income  
as in NZ Yet NZ farmers  still aim for 20-25%  replacement  rate of high RBI 
heifers  each year. In addition,  nearly  all commercial  dairy fanners  in NZ use a 
simple  system  of recording  the breeding  index  of their  dairy  animals  and are able 
to monitor  the genetic  progress  with the herd.  Similarly,  nearly  all commercial  
dairy  farmers  in NZ mate  at least  3/4 of the herd to proven  high breeding  index  
sires.  Why?  Trials  and farmer  experience  worldwide  have  repeatedly  confirmed  
that under  all conditions  and management,  high genetic  merit  cows  out perform  
their herd mates  of lower  genetic  merit.  For example,  translating  the results  of 
the NZ breeding  index  trials to Ireland  would  suggest  that a lift of 25% in the 
herds  B1 could  drop milk production  cost by 10/gal.
In NZ, calves,  heifers  and cows are now largely  sold on the basis of their  
Breeding  Index.  The animal  value  increases  relative  to the basis  of their Bl. In 
Ireland,  the same  market  is beginning  to develop  where  higher  prices  will  be paid 
for higher  RBI replacements.
But how do you know if your breeding  programme  is going forwards  or 
backwards,  if your  cows  are Incoming  more  or less efficient?  How  do you go 
about  raising  genetic  merit?  A high replacement  rate of high RBI sired heifers  
will give  the most  rapid  lift. Use  proven  sires  and keep  good  records  so you know  
where  you are going,  because  in all animal  based  industries,  increas^  genetic  
merit  lifts profits.
Summary
There  is enormous  scope  to increase  profits  on dairy  farms  in Ireland.  Do you 
want  more money  in your  pocket?  If you do then set a clear  farm objective  of 
maximising  profit.  Concentrate  your  management  on the dairy  enterprise  and on 
the key principles  of low cost milk  production,  which  are; stocking  rate,  calving  
date and pattern,  cow genetic  merit  and grazing  management.

Low Cost Dairying  in a Colder  Climate
J. ROADLEY
Ashburton,  South  Island,  New Zealand.
The base  of the New  Zealand  economy  is pastoral  agriculture.  Fifty  per cent 
of NZ exports  are grass  based.  We view  our farms  as grass  farms  first,  and dairy  
farms  second.  Decades  of farm  production  research  have  been  aimed  at increas ­
ing the quality  and  quantity  of the herbage  grown  and utilization  of that feed  with 
higher  genetic  merit  cows  at the lowest  possible  cost. The focus  of this paper  is 
on our experience  in moving  from the traditional  dairying  areas  of New  Zealand  
and beginning  a new land use in the South  of New Zealand  and the techniques  
developed  to farm there.
Reason  for moving
In the late 1 970’s we believed  our future  as dairy  farmers  was in doubt  - we 
had an average  size operation  in the North Island  with reasonable  levels  of 
production  but I was worried  about  the ability  of that farm to provide  for our 
families  future.  We began  investigating  the feasibility  of moving  farms  from the 
North  Island  to the South  Island.  The South  Island  of New  Zealand  had certain  
appeal.  There  were a few dairying  enthusiasts  who believed  that there was 
potential . This  belief  was  supported  by the Dairy  Board  Consulting  Officer  of the 
time.  The sceptics  in both  the traditional  areas  and the South  Island  all said it  was 
impossible  to successfully  dairy  farm there  because  of the cold winters  and low 
pasture  growth  that ensued.  Certainly,  the climatic  data  showed  much  lower  soil 
temperature  and the pasture  production  data  showed  much lower  winter  growth.
The  dairy  industry  that had been  strong  in Canterbury  and Southland  declined  
rapidly  over  the 1950’s and 60’s. Many  of the remaining  dairy  farms  had systems  
that depended  on massive  winter  inputs  from 7 to 10 tonnes  silage  per cow. This 
was ten times  that being  used by us in the North.
Despite  that, I was optimistic  about  the South  Island.  It appeared  to me as if 
farm management  practices  lacked  the benefit  of applied  research.  It appeared  
as if no effort  was being  made  to enhance  winter  grass  growth.  The remainder  
of the season  had a very reliable  and predictable  pasture  production  pattern  
guaranteed  by irrigation  in Canterbury.  My vote went  with the enthusiasts.
In 1980  we purchased  a sheep  and crop farm  and immediately  converted  it to 
dairying.  The first season  was not as easy as I thought  - there were local 
differences  and we did not know all the answers.  The small band of local 
dairymen  with the support  of the Dairy Company  and the local Ministry  of 
Agriculture  and Fisheries  (MAF)  decided  that we needed  some  applied  research  
to identify  that limiting  factors  for achieving  high levels  of low cost production  
- the theme  was “Can  Canterbury  achieve  500 kg milkfat  per ha”?, equivalent  to 
1200 gal per acre at 3.6% fat corrected  milk. The dairy experts  from Ruakurs  
were invited  to lead the effort  and fortunately  at that time the funding  was 
available.  It was decided  to monitor  local data against  similar  information  from
43
the Ruakura  No. 2 Dairy.  After  the first  season  when  information  was collected  
from  three  farms  in the region  it was decided  to target  more  detailed  information  
from one farm. We were to be the guinea  pigs! Critical  measurements  were:-  
pasture  growth  - pasture  utilised  - stocking  rate - calving  spread  - cow  condition/  
health  - milking  machine  efficiency
Our first season  in the South  Island  yielded  315 kg milk fat per ha. At the 
conclusion  of the three year monitoring  project  production  reached  520 kg 
milkfat  per ha.
Dairy  herd expansion  on South  Island
The results  excited  the dairy  farmers  of New  Zealand.  Interest  in dairying  in 
the South  Island  was  stimulated.  The  7 dairy  farms  in our  county  in 1980  has now 
grown  to 77 - mostly  people  moving  from other  areas  of New  Zealand  bringing  
their cows with them as land use pressures  from horticulture,  racehorses  and 
urban  subdivision  made  the South  Island  attractive.  Now  Southland  is experienc ­
ing the surge  in farm conversions  as people  rediscover  dairying  in the region.
Today,  as in 1980 we seek greater  efficiency,  greater  profitability,  - that is 
what  drives  our farm strategic  plan.  Research  has identifi^  four  critical  factors  
that require  major  policy  decisions  on each farm:-
1. Stocking  rate - The number  of cows  per hectare.
2. Calving  date - The planned  starting  day.
3. Calving  spread  - How fast the herd calves.
4. Cow quality  - Genetic  ability.
Farm  management  policy  
On our farm the policy  is:-
* Stocking  rate 2.9 cows  per ha
* Calving  date August  10
* Calving  rate targets: -
PS-MP  15 days
MP - Last Cow  2Q days
Total  45 days
Those  policies  create  a feed  demand  curve  which  can be applied  to the supply  
curve  and identify  the periods  of likely  deficits  and surplus.  Two significant  
options  available  to us are:
1. Strategic  use of nitrogen,  regular  autumn  application  of 20 kg N per ha are  
used as the volumes  of irrigation  water  applied  over summer  leave soil 
nitrogen  depleted.
2. Off farm winter  grazing  is an ongoing  strategy.  Taking  the herd  off the farm 
for 60 days adds a different  dimension  to the demand  curve  and it is from  
such  basic  data that we fine tune the operation  to exploit  our farms  ability  to 
produce  grass  and our herds  ability  to produce  milk.
Focusing  on the late autumn/winter/early  spring  periods  we begin  with  a feed 
budget,  a statement  of what is available  by way of feed stuff  - grass  on the farm 
(average  cover),  likely  growth  and supplements  according  to herd demand  for
44
maintenance,  production  and weight  gain. A predictive  picture  is then  generated  
of what happens  to the average  cover  on the farm and targets  for that very 
important  yardstick  are set. The low point  for the year is what  drives  the whole  
decision making  process.  This  point  represents  the time  that we run out of feed.  
Obviously  the closer  we can get this point  to the date that  daily  growth  exceeds  
the herd demand  the better  - the ‘magic  day’.
In our operation  the target  level and the target  date are set six months  in 
advance  and  we work  backwards  using  the feed  budget  predictions  to set the next 
target  point,  this being  when  the first  cow calves,  then to the point  that the herd 
returns  to the farm from winter  grazing,  and finally  the most flexible  and 
probably  the most  important  date of all - drying  off date.
Six to eight  weeks  prior  to likely  drying  off we develop  a target  average  cover  
graph.  Weekly  monitoring  of the whole  farm  gives  an actual  line which  is plotted  
against  the target.  Provided  that the actual  average  cover on the farm falls 
between  tolerance  levels  on the graph  we will continue  milking.  The only  other  
factor  influencing  drying  off decisions  is cow condition.  Our feed  budgets  have  
assumed  a weight  gain  requirement  and  cow  condition  must  not be allowed  to fall 
below  target  levels.  We dry individual  cows  or groups  of cows  off early  on this 
liveweight  (condition  score)  criterion  regardless  of production  levels.
Autumn  management
Pasture  management  during  autumn  is aimed  at encouraging  a sward  that  will 
maximise  winter  growth.  Intensifying  the farm subdivision  with temporary  
electric  fence  reels  can increase  the daily  stock  density  thereby  forcing  cows  to 
graze  lower  and clean  out any rough  patches  that have  developed  over  summer.  
Thus the grazing  rotation  is lengthened  giving  more  time between  grazing  as 
daily  growth  rates fall. This limits  cows ’ intakes  and slows  the reduction  in the 
farm ’s average  cover.  Some  supplements  are commonly  fed at this point  usually  
in the form of silage  or crop residues  which  are readily  available  in our region  
- barley  or grassed  straws  which  increase  the bulk of feed offered  and preserve  
cow condition,  thus adding  a few days to the lactation  length.
Winter
At drying  off, the herd will be in a condition  that will allow  them to reach  
target  condition  score  at calving  with the feed available  both on the grazing  off 
property  and the home  farm.  The average  cover  on the farm  will be at the level,  
given that predicted  growth  rates  over  winter  reach  the target.  Pasture  composi ­
tion will be such  as to give  greatest  winter  growth  - dense,  vigorous,  leafy  pasture  
allowing  maximum  sunlight  interception  and penetration.
Regular  monitoring  against  our targets  all winter  allows  for constant  fine 
tuning.  Greater  than predicted  winter  growth  rates  could  allow  for higher  winter  
feeding levels  and the herd  arriving  back  on the farm  a few days  earlier  and a bit 
heavier.  Less than predicted  growth  rates could  require  the opposite  or the use 
of nitrogen  to boost  grass  growth  in early  spring.
Calving  season
Planned  start  of calving  will be 6 to 8 weeks  before  the “magic  day” i.e. the
45
day growth  equals  demand.  This is our most hectic  period  on the farm. With  
many mobs of cows requiring  differing  feeding  levels  i.e. late calvers,  early  
calvers,  freshly  calved  cows  and milkers.
However  the objectives  do not change:  careful  feed allocation,  good  utiliza ­
tion,  monitoring  the resource  of  average  cover  and  daily  growth,  measuring  daily  
milk  production.  Usually  one complete  rotation  of the farm is achieved  from the 
beginning  of calving  to the point  when  daily  supply  exceeds  demand.  There  can 
be some  tolerance  of underfeeding  of the herd  at this point  as our high Bl cows  
will bounce  back  after  a short  period  of underfeeding,  say 10 days.
Rotation  length  and pasture  quality
The rotation  length  will remain  at about  30 days until grass  growth  acceler ­
ates. At that point  we adopt  a fast grazing  round  -10 to 12 days in an effort  to 
control  pasture  and maintain  a high quality  sward.  Research  indicates  there is 
litde long  term advantage  in one rotation  length  over  another  once  daily  growth  
rate is ahead  of herd demands.  The objective  must  be to fully  feed the cows  and 
maintain  a high quality  pasture.
We find that by following  this process  we are able to identify  management  
targets.  Questions,  such  as: Can we calve  a little  earlier?  Can we lift the stocking  
rate? can be answered  with some  logic.
Conclusion
Although  this paper  is targeted  at our pasture  management  techniques  it must  
be emphasised  that the herd ’s concentrated  calving  pattern  is a major  key to 
successful  seasonal  dairy farming.  It is a major  management  issue and takes  
precedence  over  everything  during  that time. With the total herd being  dry for 
90-1- days  the importance  of having  every  cow  calved  as soon  as possible  after  the 
planned  start is the only way of gaining  lactation  days.
The results  of these strategies  are measured  in our production  and our 
profitability.
Production  for this season  will be 207 kg milkfat  per cow (all milk  counted),  
giving  600 kg milkfat  per ha (1012  kg fat and protein  per ha).

Making  Silage  a Less Variable  
Feedstuff
P. O’KIELY  and T. KEATING  
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
On typical  calf-to-beef  or spring-calving  dairy farms, grass silage now 
accounts  for about  24%  of the annual  intake  of feed  diy matter  (DM),  with  grazed  
grass and concentrates  contributing  approximately  66 and 10%, respectively.  
The significance  of silage  becomes  more important  when one considers  that 
those quantitative  contributions  from silage,  grazed  grass and concentrates  
represent  about  36, 30 and 35% of the annual  feed bill, respectively.  Conse ­
quently,  the yield  and quality  of silage  are of major  importance  on all livestock  
farms,  both in terms of the reliability  with which they can be consistently  
achieved  and the cost of feeding  animals  with silage.  The purpose  of this paper  
is to quantify  how variable  grass  silage  is on Irish farms,  and identify  ways  of 
making  it a less variable  feedstuff.  This is addressed  in the form of four 
questions:
1. How variable  is silage?
2. Why is silage  so variable?
3. Does  the variability  matter?
4. How can silage  be made  less variable?
1. HOW  VARIABLE  IS SILAGE?
The yield of silage  per hectare  can be very  variable.  Where  typical  first-cut  
yields  of 5 tonnes  grass  DMAia  are achieved  on May 24, this can vary by 20% 
from  year to year  on the same  farm . Variation  in grass  yields  in July and August  
may  be considerably  greater.  When  grass  yields  are expressed  on a fresh  (green)  
basis,  the magnitude  of variation  is enlarged  further,  with  first-cut  yeilds  on May 
24 ranging  fromn  20 to 50 tonnes  per hectare.  The scale  of variation  in silage  
quality  is shown  in Tables  1 and 2. On a national  basis,  considerable  variation  in 
silage  composition  occurs  from year to year,  and among  cuts within  years.  For 
example,  first-cut  silages  were  drier  and had better  preservation  and  digestibility  
in 1991/92  than 1992/93,  while  the reverse  held for second-cut  silages.  Looking  
at first-cut  silages  in 1991/92,  the maximum  and minimum  values  recorded  
among  samples  analysed  by Grange  Laboratories  were  dry matters  of 350 and 
120g DM/kg,  pH values  of 8.2 and 3.5,  crude  proteins  of250  and95 g CP/kg  DM 
and dry matter  digestibilities  of 840 and 340 g/kg DM, respectively.
Silages  also vary widely  in their aerobic  stability  upon exposure  to air at 
feeding  time.  Among  84 farm silages  evaluated  for their  aerobic  stability  under  
controlled  conditions  (10 days),  quantitative  dry matter  losses  ranged  from 0 to 
575 g/kg  and qualitative  losses  in dry matter  digestibility  ranged  from  O to 248  
g/kg DM (O’Kiely,  1989).

2. WHY  IS SILAGE  SO VARIABLE?
Variable  weather  conditions  have a large effect on silage-making.  Irish 
climatic  conditions  differ  widely  from those in most of northern  and western  
Europe.  Keane  (1988)  has shown  that solar radiation  and the incidence  of 
consecutive  rain-free  days are lower  in Ireland,  and vary widely  within  and 
between  years, while Thram  and Broekhuizen  (1965)  showed  that relative  
humidities  are higher  in Ireland.
48
Yield
Grass  dry matter  yields  are affected  by a number  of factors  such  as soil fertility  
and nutrient  supply,  sward  botanical  composition,  season,  growth  interval,  
environmental  conditions,  etcetera.  Weather  conditions  immediately  before  and 
during  harvesting  significantly  influence  the dry matter  concentration  in grass,  
and therefore  the yield  of fresh (green)  grass.  For example,  if a 25 tonne/ha  crop  
of 200 g dry matter/kg  received  a rainfall  such as to reduce  its dry matter  
concentration  to 170 and 140 g/kg, the fresh  yield  would  increase  to 29 and 36 
tonnes/ha,  respectively.
Rate of decline  in digestilility
As grass  develops  from the  vegetative  to inflorescence  phases,  the proportion  
of leaf decreases,  lignification  increases  and the digestibility  declines.  The 
initiation  of this process  is significantly  influenced  by day-length  (Jones,  1988)  
and therefore  tends to be predictable  from year to year. However  the rate of 
digestibility  decline  can be altered  by factors  such as drought  which  causes  the 
proportion  of leaf to decrease  more  rapidly  (Jones,  1988),  while  high tempera-

tures increase  the rate of lignification  and the rate of senescence  of the lower  
leaves  (Deinum,  1984).  Severe  crop lodging  during  wet weather  also increases  
the rate of decline  in digestibility  (O’Kiely  et al. 1987)  and, in some  circum ­
stances,  plant  diseases  may also be important.  Experiments  are in progress  at 
Grange  to determine  if grass  growth  during  mild  winters  reduces  the digestibility  
in late May due to the accumulation  of dead  vegetation  at the base of the crop.
Silage  fermentation
The principle  of preserving  grass  as silage  is based  on storing  it in an oxygen-  
free environment  which will inhibit  plant enzymes  and undesirable  micro ­
organisms.  This is usually  accomplished  through  the fermentation  of sugars  in 
the crop to lactic  acid by lactic  acid bacteria  (Figure  1).
Due to the low dry matter  concentration  in Irish silages,  they normally  
undergo  an extensive  fermentation  (Wilson  and  O’Kiely,  1990).  However,  since  
a myriad  of management,  environmental  and crop factors  interact  to determine  
the type of fermentation  (Pitt, Muck  and Leibensperger,  1985),  and many  of 
these factors  vary considerably  and are outside  the farmers  control,  it is not 
surprising  that the fermentation  characteristics  of farm  silages  are so variable.  
Most  of the procedures  undertaken  in silage-making  aim to facilitate  lactic  acid  
bacteria  to dominate  the fermentation.  However,  even  where  lactic  acid  bacteria  
are dominant,  the fermentation  of unwilted  grass on farms is still relatively  
unconUolled  compared  to industrial  fermentation  processes  where  ingredient  
composition  and environmental  conditions  are strictly  controlled.
Water  soluble  carbohydrates  (WSC).  Non-structural  carbohydrates  such 
as glucose,  fructose,  sucrose  and fructans,  which  are soluble  in cold water,  are 
energy  sources  for lactic  acid bacteria  during  silage  fermentation.  The amount  
of WSC  present  in the grass  at harvesting  is critical,  since  sufficient  lactic  acid 
must be produced  during  fermentation  to reduce  the pH from about 6.0 to 
approximately  4.0. The WSC  content  is a balance  between  the sugars  anabolised  
during  photosynthesis  and those catabolised  during  respiration  or used for 
growth.  Temperature  has an effect  on this balance,  with lower  temperatures  
tending  to restrict  respiration  more than photosynthesis,  the result  oeing that 
WSC  levels  increase  (Deinum,  1984).  Solar  radiation  correlates  positively  with  
grass WSC values  (Deinum,  1984).  Deinum ’s studies  therefore  suggest  that 
WSC levels in grass DM are highest  when plants are grown  at high light 
intensities  and low temperature  and lowest  in shade and high temperature.  
McGrath  (1988)  has shown  that within  WSC,  the balance  of individual  sugars  is 
influenced  by both season  and climate.
Grass  WSC,  expressed  as g/1 aqueous  phase,  vary considerably.  Weather  
(Figure  2), together  with grass species/cultivar  and fertiliser  (Table  3) have a 
major  effect,  while season,  physiological  growth  stage and time of day have  
lesser  effects.  The major  diumd  effect  is that of dew. Rainfall,  by wetting  the 
crop,  clearly  lowers  the WSC  content  in the aqueous  phase.  Consequently,  if a 
crop  of200 g dry matter  (DM)/kgandl50g  WSC/kg  DM  received  a rain  fall such 
as to reduce  its DM content  to 170 g/kg or 140 g/kg, the WSC  content  in the 
aqueous  phase  would  decrease  from 37.5 g/1 to 30.7 or 24.4 g/1, respectively.

Figure  2 demonstrates  the variation  in grass WSC during  May to July in 
successive  years  when  both the crop and management  practices  were  constant  
(O’Kiely et al 1987).  Most of this variation  was weather  related,  tending  to 
decrease  during  wet, overcast,  warm  conditions.  If 30 g WSC/I  is taken  as a 
threshold  above  which  the grass  should  be relatively  easy to preserve  as silage,  
the ensiiabiiity  of grass was very variable  and was strongly  influenced  by 
weather.  However,  the entire  fermentation  process  can interact  with ambient  
temperature.  O’Kiely  (1991- unpublished  data) has shown  that  by increasing  the 
ambient  temperature  at which  autumn  harvested  grass  was  stored  during  ensilage
51
from  7°C to 18°C,  mean  silage  pH, ethanol,  acetic  acid  and propionic  acid levels  
increased  from  4.2 to 4.7,25  to 70 g/kg DM,  21 to 91 g/kg  DM and 0.4 to 8.5 g/ 
kg DM respectively,  while  lactic  acid decreased  from 83 to 19 g/kg DM. This 
difference  probably  reflects  the dominance  of Enterobacteria  rather than 
lactic  acid bacteria  due to the changed  environmental  conditions  in that experi ­
ment.
Buffering  capacity. The buffering  capacity  of grass  is its ability  to resist  a 
change  in pH and is expressed  as milli equivalents  (m.eq)/kg  DM required  to 
reduce  the pH from 6.0 to 4.0. It can be quite  variable  in grass  and is influenced  
by protein,  organic  acids, chlorides,  orthophosphates,  nitrates  etc. (Muck,  
O’Kiely  and Wilson,  1991a;  Muck,  Wilson  and O’Kiely, 1991b).  It tends to 
decrease  as grass  develops  into  the inflorescence  phase  (Muck  et al., 1991a)  but 
can also be influenced  by grass  species/cultivar,  fertiliser  and weather.  Typical  
values  for the primary  growth  and subsequent  summer  regrowths  start  at 400 to 
450 m.eq./kg  DM and decline  linearly  by about  20 m.eq./kg  DM/week.  Buffer ­
ing capacities  remain  high in autumn  grasses  (Muck  et al., 1991a).  Muck  and 
Walgenbach  (1985)  showed  that  buffering  capacities  in alfalfa  are higher  in leaf 
than stem and decrease  more  rapidly  in stem than leaf. Consequently,  climatic  
influences  on the leaf  to stem  ratio  could  indirectly  influence  buffering  capacity.  
The data  of Muck  and Walgenbach  (1985)  also suggest  that the uptake  of Zn, Fe, 
Cu and Al, and to a lesser  extent  K and Mn, increases  buffering  capacity  - their  
uptake  could  also be related  to climatic  conditions.
Microflora.  The lactic  acid  bacteria  of most  importance  in silage  production  
include  Lactobacillus,  Pediococcus,  Streptococcus  and Leuconostocs.  Moran  
and O’ Kiely  (1989)  monitored  counts  of total  lactic  acid  bacteria  (LAB)  on grass  
grown for silage between  May and September.  Much higher  counts  were  
obtained  in Ireland  (5.50 log 10 CFU/g  grass;  s.d. 1.26) (Moran  and O’Kiely,  
1989) than in many other countries  (Pahlow,  1991).  This was attributed  by 
Moran  and co-workers  to the lower  influx  of ultra violet  radiation,  the higher  
humidity  and less variable  temperature  than other  countries,  as well as to the 
dense  crops  of grass  grown  for silage.  In addition,  Pahlow  (1991)  has proposed  
that in Ireland  LAB  are less likely  to enter  a somnicell  phase  (i.e. dormant)  as a 
result  of stress  caused  by climatic  conditions  than in other  countries,  thereby  
explaining  the higher  counts  of viable LAB cells found on Irish grasses.  
However,  O’ Kiely  (1989  - unpublished  data)  has found  very  low LAB  counts  on 
grass in very dry and sunny weather  in a very sparse  crop. Clostridia  and 
Enterobacteria  are two of the main undesirable  bacteria  found in silage.  Soil and 
animal  manure  contamination  arc the main sources  of inoculation.  With good  
silage-making  practice  their effects  should  be reduced.  Nevertheless,  to permit  
efficient  recycling  of nuU'icnts,  slurry is normally  spread  on the bare gra.ss  
stubble.  In the absence  of rainfall  in the days after spreading,  the likelihood  of 
contamination  carrying  through  to harvesting  is increased.  This is shown  in 
Table  4 where  the increased  content  of butyric  acid suggests  the activity  of 
saccharolytic  Clostridia.

Field drying.  Solar radiation  - radiant  energy  falling  on the crop - is the 
primary  driving  force  for moisture  evaporation.  Drying  rate is also  influenced  by 
the temperature  and the humidity  of the ambient  air (vapour  pressure  deficit),  
moisture  content  of the soil and thickness  of the swath.  Mechanical  and  chemical  
treatments  can speed  field-curing  under  good  drying  conditions,  but they cannot  
compensate  for poor drying  weather  (Bolsen,  Brent and Dickerson  1991). 
Shown  in Table  5 are the hours  required  to dry alfalfa  from 80% down  to 20%  
moisture,  under  constant  weather  conditions  (Rotz  and  Chen,  1985).  These  range  
from 12 to 48 hours.  Because  environmental  conditions  rarely  remain  constant,  
particularly  when  the drying  period  extends  overnight,  actual  fieldcuring  times  
are longer. They  would  be considerably  slower  if weather  conditions  were  wet.

Partial  field drying  of grass  is sometimes  used prior to ensiling  as a mecha ­
nism to reduce,  or prevent,  effluent  production  and to facilitate  good  preserva ­
tion.  The mean  dry matter  (DM)  contents  of grass  at cutting  or after  6 or 24 hours  
wilting  in 13 experiments  at Grange  between  1980  and 1985 were  208,223  and 
268 g DM/kg,  respectively.  In each case wilting  conditions  were good.  Simul ­
taneously , wilting  experiments  planned  for pre-selected  dates  were  postponed  on
53
15 occasions  due to wet weather  and on four other occasions  wilting  was 
attempted  and failed.  In a separate  series  of experiments  where  field  wilting  was 
carried  out,  it was  shown  that tedding  grass  to achieve  full ground  cover,  together  
with frequent  turning,  was essential  to maximise  drying  rates (Table  6). Rain  
reduced  DM  and WSC  concentrations  more  immediately  after  it fell on an uncut  
rather  than a mown  untedded  crop (O’Kiely,  1988/89a),  but the standing  crop 
also dried more  rapidly.

Additives.  The type of silage additive  recommended,  if any, is strongly  
influenced  by weather  conditions,  with preservatives  such as acid or sugar  
additives  being  preferred  where  ensiling  conditions  are difficult  (Table  12) and 
inoculants  of LAB where  ensiling  conditions  are good (Table  13). Whatever  
additive  is used, the application  rate is expressed  per tonne  harvested  grass.  In 
the absence  of weighing  facilities  on farms,  the rate of harvesting  is difficult  to 
identify  when  expressed  as tonnes/hour  but not when  expressed  as hectares/hour.  
However,  as a crop  gets  wetter  during  rain the yield  of fresh  grass  per hectare  can 
readily  rise by 60% (Table  14), thereby  necessitating  a corresponding  increase  
in additive  application.
Rate of achieving  anaerobiosis.  When  anaerobic  conditions  are achieved  
quickly  after  harvesting,  good  preservation  (Wilson  and Flynn,  1979)  as well as  
enhanced  aerobic  stability  at feeding  time  (Honig  1991),  are facilitated.  Very  wet 
weather  at harvesting  can retard  the speed  with  which  the silo is filled  and thereby  
detrimentally  prolong  aerobic  conditions.
Aerobic  deterioration
Since  ensilage  is by necessity  an anaerobic  process,  silage,  once it comes  in 
contact  with air at feeding  time,  is inherently  unstable.  Silages  vary  enormously  
in their instability  when  exposed  to air, the rate of deterioration  depending  on 
management  factors  (based  on minimising  the duration  of exposure  to air), 
weather  and  silage  microbiological,  physical  and  chemical  composition  (O’Kiely,
54
1989).  Higher  ambient  temperatures  increase  the rate of aerobic  deterioration  of 
silage  (Table  7), as do dark and humid  conditions  (O’Kiely,  1988/89b).

Grass  ensiiabiiity  in 1992
Over  1000  grass  samples  from  farms  were  analysed  by Grange  Laboratories  
during  1992,  as part of a service  to help farmers  estimate  the ease  of preserving  
grass  as silage. The results  are summarised  in Tables  8 and 9 and show  low and 
variable  WSC  and dry matter  concentrations  while  both  the first  and second  cuts 
were  being  harvested.  However,  average  buffering  capacities  of first-cut  grasses  
were  extremely  high  (compared  to data  of Muck  et al, 1991  a) until  mid  June.  The 
low WSC  concentration  and high  buffering  capacity  meant  that  these  grasses  had 
poor  ensiiabiiity  characteristics  and would  be very  difficult  to preserve  properly.
3. DOES  THE  VARIABILITY  MATTER?
The variability  in the yield,  digestibility,  preservation  and aerobic  stability  of 
silage  have  a major  impact  on the cost  of producing  silage  (Table  10) and on the 
feed cost per unit of animal  production.
The following  can be deduced  from  Table  10;
(a) The yield  of grass  dry matter  is the most important  silage  characteristic  
influencing  the cost of producing  silage.  Assuming  a fixed harvesting  cosl/ha  
and constant  DM and DMD  concenuations,  the relative  cost (£/tonne  silage  
digestible  DM) is highly  sensitive  to DM yield, with light crops being very 
expensive  to produce  and heavy  crops  much less expensive  -the lowest  to the 
highest  values  differ  by more  than a factor  of two.
(b) Assuming  a constant  yield of harvested  DM, the wetter  the grass in a 
direct-cut  or unwilted  silage  system,  the more  expensive  silage  digestible  DM 
becomes.  This is due to greater  in-silo  losses  (especially  effluent  and fermenta ­
tion) and requirements  for preservative  (applied  per tonne fresh grass)  with 
wetter  grass.
(c) At a constant  yield  of dry matter  and a constant  DM concentration,  higher

digestibility  silage  has a lower  relative  cost  compared  to low digestibility  silage,  
even allowing  for the likelihood  of greater  use of preservative  with leafy  grass.
(d) Delayed  harvesting,  corresponding  with a rapid increase  in yield  and a 
decrease  in DMD,  results  in a decrease  in the relative  cost of silage  digestible  
DM. However,  to fully  compare  silages  of differing  DMD,  the relative  feed  cost/  
kg carcass  gain  or milk  production  should  be calculated,  with  the largest  benefits  
from high DMD  being  obtained  at lower  levels  of concentrate  supplementation.

4. HOW  CAN  SILAGE  BE MADE  LESS  VARIABLE  - MORE  
RELIABLE?
Weather  patterns,  both  directly  and indirectly,  impact  in a very  major  way  on 
the yield,  dry matter  concentration,  digestibility,  preservation  and unit cost of 
silage.  Consequently,  there is a clear  limit on the extent  to which  any of these  
factors  can be reliably  controlled.  It may not always  be possible  to reduce  
variability  and when  it is possible,  it will often  depend  on the ability  to reactor  
respond  quickly  and with flexibility  to particular  circumstances  that arise  due to 
weather.  This ability  to respond  is often difficult  to achieve,  especially  if it is 
remembered  that 80% of silage is harvested  by contractors,  so a farmers  
flexibility  may be constrained.
Yield
Assuming  that soil fertility,  structure,  drainage  and nutrient  supply  are 
satisfactory,  the yield  of  a particular  sward  is substantially  dependent  on weather.  
At that stage,  the main  mechanism  for achieving  a given  yield  is by altering  the 
harvesting  date. However,  delaying  harvesting  date  to increase  yield  is normally  
accompanied  by a decrease  in digestibility.  The correct  balance  between  yield  
and quality  will depend,  among  other factors,  on the type and intensity  of 
enterprise  on the farm and the relative  costs  of forage,  concentrates  and animal  
product.  However,  relative  variability  in dry matter  yield may be reduced  by 
harvesting  the first-cut  in the final week of May rather  than in mid May. The 
major  problems  emanating  from variable  yields  usually  occur  in July/August  
harvests.  On farms  that are prone  to severe  drought  this may be an insurmount ­
able problem  with grass  swards.
To assist  achieving  consistent  yields,  soil analysis  each  5 years  should  be used 
to determine  the P, K and lime status  of the silage  fields.  Appropriate  fertiliser  
inputs  should  be based  on these  results,  together  with replacing  what the crop 
removed  and what was supplied  by slurry.  Maintenance  of high fertility  is 
important  as it leads  to less fluctuation  in yield  from  yeario  year  (Murphy,  1992).  
Nitrogen  should  be applied  at least  6 weeks  pre-harvesting  and, in some  cases,  
sulphur  should  be applied  in mid-season.  Slurry  should  be applied  only  onto  bare 
stubble  - this should  be completed  by March  for first-cut  silage  and immediately  
after the previous  cut for regrowths  (see next section  on preservation).
Dry matter
Grass  dry matter  concentrations  impact  on the fresh yield,  effluent  losses  and 
the ease  of preservation.  The progression  in grass  dry matter  concentration  from 
200 g DM/kg  to 180,150  and 120 g DM/kg  reflects  the effects  of dew,  a heavy  
rain shower  and several  days rain, respectively.  Clearly,  the ideal option  to 
reduce  variability  in DM  concentration  is to harvest  grass  when  the dew has gone  
and in the absence  of rain. This is often not feasible.
58
Digestibility
Normally,  to achieve  a pre-specified  digestibility  for the first-cut  of a 
particular  sward  depends  on selecting  the correct  harvesting  date. This can be 
achieved  by using  mono  cultivars  or alternatively  mixtures  of cultivars  of similar  
heading  date. The onset  of a decrease  in digestibility  is normally  regulated  by 
changing  day length,  which  is predictable,  and the rate of decline  is mediated  
through  the relative  development  of leaf and stem,  the rate of lignification  and 
the emergence  of the inflorescence  (seed head).  However,  dominance  of the 
sward  by early  maturing  poor  quality  grasses  (e.g. meadow  foxtail),  the duration  
and rate of wilting,  bad silage  preservation,  excessive  losses  via effluent  and 
possibly  the accumulation  of dead or decayed  vegetation  due to, for example,  
crop lodging,  can magnify  the rate of decline.  Consequently,  having  ryegrass  
swards  whose  constituents  are of similar  digestibility,  only wilting  where  rapid  
drying  is likely,  ensuring  good  preservation  and harvesting  grass  once  it lodges  
can help achieve  a more  predictable  digestibility.  As mentioned  before,  some  of 
these  require  flexibility  in the time  and method  ofharvesting,  which  is not always  
possible  in practice.
Preservation
As mentioned  before,  the process  of silage fermentation  is not nearly  as 
controlled  as industrial  fermentations,  such as are involved  in beer or yoghurt  
manufacture.  In the latter,  ingredient  composition,  temperature,  duration  etc. are 
highly  controlled,  thereby  producing  a predictable  and consistent  product.  In 
silage  production  on the other  hand,  grass  type  and composition,  weather,  filling  
speed  etc. vary  enormously,  so the extent  of control  over  the precise  end quality  
of silage  is relatively  poor. Current  good silage-making  practice  therefore  
seeks  to promote  the likelihood  of a lactic  acid fermentation,  at a modest  
cost,  without  being  able to control  the precise  final  composition.  Guidelines  
to achieve  this include:
1. Fast filling  and perfect  sealing  of the silos  - this is the single  most  important  
factor.
2. Ensile  only clean grass,  free of all sources  of contamination.  Guidelines  
describing  the factors  determining  the correct  timing  and rate of application  
of slurry  are contained  in the accompanying  paper  at this conference  by 
Carton  (1992).  Cattle  slurry  should  be spread  at not more  than 33 t/ha (3(XX)  
gal/ac)  and 17 t/ha (15(X) gal/ac)  for first  and second  cuts,  respectively.  Rates  
in excess  of these  can increase  the risk of poor fermentation.  For firstcuts,  
slurry can  be applied  up to mid-March  provided  crops  arc not advanced.  For 
second  or third-cuts  it should  be applied  immediately  (2 to 3 days  maximum)  
after the previous  cut - it should  never  be applied  after  swards  have  greened  
up.
3. Ensure  added  niU'ogen  is spread  early and at the appropriate  rate. Murphy  
(1992)  recommends  that permanent  swards  of grass should  receive  total 
nitrogen  inputs  of 100 to 125 kg N/ha (80 to 100 units N/aere)  in a single  
(first) cut system  and 110 to 140 kg N/ha  (90 to 110 units  N/acrc)  and 75 to 
100 kg N/ha  (60 to 80 units N/acrc)  for first  and second  cuts,  respectively  in
59
a two cut system.  In some  circumstances,  higher  rates  may be justified  (e.g 
reseeds  or after  continuous  cereals).  The  above  rates  will need  to be reduced  
where  other  potential  sources  of nitrogen  such as slurry  are applied  - cattle  
slurry  applied  for firstcuts may supply  5 to 8 kg N per4500  litres  (10 to 15 
units  per 1000  gallons)  and for second-cuts,  depending  on weather,  supply  
0 to 5 kg N per 4500 litres. Murphy  (1992)  estimates  that for fertiliser  N 
applied  to the primary  growth,  the daily  utilisation  of N will be about  1.3 kg/ 
ha (1 unit/acre)  until  late March  (e.g.  24 March)  and about  2.5 kg^a  (2 units/  
acre)  thereafter.  The  rate  of uptake  can be many  times  more  rapid  than  the rate 
of utilisation,  leading  to a bansient  high concentration  of non-protein  
nitrogen  in grass.  This can be associated  with reduced  dry matter  and sugar  
concentrations  and increased  buffering  capacity  and nitrate values.  For 
second-cuts  daily uptake  of about  2.5 kg N/ha  would  be expected.  The rates  
of uptake  for the primary  growth  or regrowth  assume  normal  grass  growth  
patterns  - the uptake  may  stop  during  intervals  of very  restricted  growth  such 
as happens  during  very cold or dry weather.  Murphy  (1992)  stresses  that it 
is important  that N is spread  early, both to achieve  the maximum  yield  
response  and to avoid  any negative  effects  on grass  ensiiabiiity.  In the case 
of the primary  growth  the aim should  be to have  N applied  by mid March,  if 
possible.
4. Where  high inputs  of P and K fertiliser,  or application  of lime,  are necessary,  
they should  be spread  in the autumn.
5. Gr^s  should  be analysed  for its ensiiabiiity  immediately  before  harvesting.  
This should  include  dry matter  and water soluble  carbohydrate  (WSC)  
concentrations  and buffering  capacity  at a minimum,  and possibly  also 
nitrate  concentrations.
6. Wilting  should  only  be carried  out  during  good  drying  conditions,  and should  
not be attempted  in large,  narrow  rows  (see  Table  11). At a minimum,  where  
a large  mower  conditioner  is being  used,  the gates  at the back  of the mower  
should  be opened  wide to allow the grass be spread  in a wider swath  
(Forristal,  1992). Successful  wilting  can produce  excellently  preserved  
silages  capable  of supporting  high animal  performance.  However,  animal  
performance  and productivity  are still usually  inferior  to what is achieved  
with well preserved  unwilled  silage  (O’Kiely etal.,  1988,  O’Kiely,  1992b).

7. Where  successful  wilting  (above  250g DM/kg)  is achieved  quickly,  addi­
tives are not normally  justified.  In the absence  of successful  wilting,  it is 
appropriate  to use a silage  additive  (Figure  3). The correct  type of additive  
varies,  with preservatives  (P) being  appropriate  under  difficult  conditions  
and enhancers  (E) appropriate  under  good conditions.  Each year Teagasc  
publishes  a Directory  of Silage  Additives  which  lists  the products  on the Irish 
market,  categorises  them and, if sufficient  information  is available,  rates  
them as preservatives  or enhancers.

of silage  additive.
Teagasc considers  that the primary  role for preservatives  is under  conditions  
where  silage  made  without  additive  would  preserve  poorly.  Under  these  difficult  
ensiling  conditions,  the even application  of adequate  preservative  should  pro­
duce satisfactory  preservation  (Table  12). On the other  hand,  grass frequently  
preserves  well even  when  no additive  is used  and it is under  these  conditions  that 
enhancers  have been shown  to be capable  of enhancing  the feeding  value of 
silage  (Table  13). The decision  on whether  to use a preservative  or an enhancer  
will be based  either  on experience  or on a grass ensiiabiiity  test. The choice  
within either category  of additive  then depends  on applicator  availability,  
harvesting  system,  the requirement  to absorb  effluent  or indirectly  supply  
concentrates  to cattle  (e.g. beet pulp)  and, of course,  price.
Due to the vagaries  involved  in controlling  silage  fermentation,  a strong  
theoretical  case  has often  been  made  for preserving  grass  by preventing  fermen ­
tation and achieving  a low pH by adding  large amounts  oforganic  acids  (i.e. 
4 to 61 formic  acid/tonne  grass).  However,  in spite  of its theoretical  attractions,  
the economic  and practical  benefits  are much  less compelling.
One  major  practical  problem  when  applying  preservatives,  having  decided  on 
the correct  application  rate,  is achieving  that  application  rate.  The  recommended  
application  rate is per tonne  fresh  grass  harvested.  Consequently,  if grass  is wet, 
the fresh tonnage  harvested  per ha is much  higher.  An example  of this is given  
in Table  14 where  the effect  of the weuiess  of a crop  on its fresh  yield  per ha is 
shown.  The progression  in dry matter  concentration  from 200 g DM/kg  to 
180,150  and 120 g DM/kg  simulates  the effects  of dew,  a heavy  rain shower  and 
several  days  rain,  respectively.  Clearly,  if the desired  rate of preservative  is to be 
applied,  it is essential  for silage-makers  to get an accurate  estimate  of the 
tonnage  of grass  in trailers  (weigh  trailer  loads  of grass  or measure  strips  of cut 
grass)  and the time  taken  to fill ihe trailers  or harvest  a hectare. It is also important  
to verify  that the applicators  are adding  the required  rate.

8. Ryegrass  swards  are m uch easier  to preserve  than  old swards  with  low  ryegrass  
content.  It is also easier,  where  the maturity  span of the constituent  grasses  
in the mixture  is narrow,  to attain  a more  consistent  digestibility  (Keating  et 
al., 1990).
Aerobic  spoilage
Silage,  whether  well preserved  or badly  preserved,  is inherently  unstable  and 
on opening  the pit it begins  to deteriorate  (O’Kiely,  1989).  This can be seen as
62
heating,  increased  waste  or refusals  and in severe  cases,  visible  mould  growth.  
The presence  of any of these  when  a pit is first opened  indicates  that there  was 
not complete  exclusion  of air (oxygen)  during  storage.  Properly  sealed  silage  
(i.e., air having  no access  to silage  during  storage)  will have  no waste,  heating  
or mould  when  it is first  opened.  Mouldy  silage  should  not  be offered  to livestock.
The three  main  factors  affecting  aerobic  deterioration  once  silos  are opened  
are (1) management,  (2) weather,  and (3) silage characteristics.  Of these,  
management  is the most  important.  Management  practices  must  aim to minimise  
the contact  time between  silage  and air. This involves:
- Moving  through  the silage  face quickly.
- Presenting  trough-fed  animals  with  only as much  silage  as they can eat in a 
day.
- Keeping  the silage  face as undisturbed  as possible  - rough  or careless  
removal  of silage  from  the silo leaves  behind  a tattered  silage  face  into  which  
air can penetrate  deeply.
- Keeping  polythene  on top of the pit fully weighted  down  and taut as far as 
the front  of the silage.
- Not covering  the silage  face with  polythene  at feeding  time  as this creates  a 
“mushroomhouse ” environment.
There are no chemicals  available  for treatment  of the silage face which  
effectively  prevent  aerobic  deterioration.
It has b^n shown,  in Grange  experiments  (Table  7) that warmer  weather  
increases  the susceptibility  of silage  to aerobic  deterioration.  Consequently,  the 
above  mentioned  management  practices  are crucially  important  during  periods  
of mild  warm  weather,  as deterioration  is more  extensive  in such  conditions.  The 
economic  penalty  for aerobic  spoilage  depends  on the extent  of deterioration  and 
is normally  severe.  High  losses  from aerobic  spoilage  can result  in over 10% of 
the conserved  grass  not being  available  for consumption  by animals.
CONCLUSIONS
Grass silage is the dominant  conserved  fodder  in Ireland,  and underpins  
ruminant  nutrition  during  the winter  on almost  all intensive  commercial  farms.  
It fulfills  this role because  it integrates  into existing  farming  systems  quite  well 
and,  across  a broad  range  of conditions,  because  it delivers  sufficient  w inter  feed 
of adequate  quality  and acceptable  cost compared  to alternative  feedstuffs.  On 
a minority  of farms  at present  this may not be the case. Grass  silage  dominates  
the winter  fodder  scene  despite  handicaps  such  as variability  in yield  and quality,  
the occurrence  of silage effluent,  the cost of concrete  silos, etc. With the 
anticipated  decrease  in the cost  of conccnU'atcs,  the cost  competitiveness  of grass  
silage  may  become  less attractive.  Consequently,  it is important  that,  where  grass  
silage  is used,  it is a reliable  feedstuff  produced  at a competitive  cost.
A large number  of factors  determine  the magnitude  and consistency  of 
important  characteristics  of silage  such as yield,  digestibility,  preservation  and 
aerobic  stability.  All of these are significantly  influenced  by our changeable  
weather  conditions.  However,  clear guidelines  are available,  and have been
63
presented  in this paper,  showing  how high yields  of good  quality  silage  can be 
produced  with reasonable  reliability.  Firstly,  good  grass  production  and silage ­
making  practices  must be used consistently.  Secondly,  our changeable  and 
unpredictable  weather  will impose  variation  on the yield  and quality  of grass  
silage,  just  as it will with many  other  crops.  The  key to responding  to this source  
of variation  depends  on the ability  to operate  a flexible,  adjustable  silage-making  
system  (ie. ability to alter harvesting  date, select preservative  or enhancer  
additives  as appropriate  and apply  them evenly  and at the correct  rate) and to 
know  the changing  status  of factors  such as soil fertility,  grass  ensiiabiiity  and 
grass yield (or harvesting  rate). In the longer  term, reseeding  with jjerennial  
ryegrasses  of similar  heading  characteristics,  helps  reduce  variability  consider ­
ably.  Where  the above  mentioned  guidelines  are possible,  and many  commercial  
farms  currently  achieve  these  targets,  the variability  in silage  can be reduced  in 
most  cases,  but not prevented.

Causes  and Prevention  of 
Hypomagnesaemic  Tetany
P. A. M. ROGERS
Teagasc,  Grange  Research  Centre,  Dunsany,  Co. Meath.
This  paper  summarises  the research  results  on hypomagnesaemia,  its causal  
factors,  factors  which  influence  magnesium  (Mg) absorption,  dietary  Mg re­
quirements  for lactation,  effects  of hypomagnesaemia  and the times  of high  risk.
Hypomagnesaemia  means  low blood  Mg level.  Normal  levels  are 1.7-3.0  mg 
per decilitre.  Levels  between  1.2-1.69  mg are hypomagnesaemic  and below  1.2 
mg are severely  hypomagnesaemic.  In tetanic  cases,  plasma  Mg is usually  0.2- 
1.0 mg per dl.
Causes  of hypomagnesaemia
A normal  level of plasma  Mg depends  on adequate  day-to-day  absorption  of 
Mg. Plasma  Mg falls if the amount  of Mg absorbed  is less than  2.5g  plus  that lost 
in milk  (0.12  g per 1 milk).  Removal  of Mg supplement  during  high-risk  periods  
can be followed  by a severe  fall in plasma  Mg and tetany  within  1-2 days.
The net amount  of Mg absorbed  is reduced  by any of the factors  which  reduce  
feed intake,  reduce  the Mg content  of the fe^, or reduce  the availability  of 
dietary  Mg. If Mg requirements  for maintenance  and for milk  production  exceed  
the net amount  absorbed  from  the digesta,  the cow  goes  into  negative  Mg balance  
and hypomagnesaemia  follows.  Severe  stress  activates  adrenalin  release  and fat 
mobilisation.  This can reduce  Mg and Calcium  (Ca) levels in blood.  Stress  
superimposed  on hypomagnesaemia  can trigger  an outbreak  of tetany.
Mlagnesium  absorption
The amount  of Mg absorbed  per day depends  on two factors:  (a) total daily  
intake  of Mg and (b) net availability  of dietary  Mg.
Intake  of Mg by cows  depends  on feed DM  intake  and the Mg content  of the 
feed DM. Mg level in feeds can vary widely,  for example,  herbage  DM may 
contain  0.13%  - 0.26%  Mg and the DM of mangel  tops may contain  1.00%- 
1.43%  Mg. Table  1 shows  the Mg content  of some  common  forages  and feeds.  
On unsupplementcd  grass  or grass  silage.  Mg intake  can range  from  below  20 to 
more  than 40 g per day.
In winter,  intake  by calved  diary  cows  fed silage  and concentrates  is about  15 
kg DM per cow per day (Table  2). If the silage  and concentrates  contain  0.20%  
and 0.35%  Mg respectively,  total  Mg intake  would  be about  38 g per cow  per day.
In May,  on good  grass  alone,  DM intake  by cows  on grazed  pasture  may be 
up to 3.5%  of liveweight,  i.e. about  19 kg per day. At 0.19%  DM,  Mg intake  from  
spring  grass  is about  36.6  g per cow  per day (Table  2). However,  lush  grass  often  
has Mg levels  in the range  0.13-0.19%  DM, thus Mg intakes  from such grass  
could  be 25 g per cow per day or lower.

falling,  DM intake  may  fall to 3% of hveweightbut  herbage  Mg may rise to 0.25%,  so that Mg intake  may  be 
1.3 g per cow (Table  3). DM intake  by calved  suckler  cows  on sparse  winter  
p^tures  may be as litUe as 2% of liveweight.  Even  if a supplement  of 2 kg hay 
DM per head  per day is fed,  their  total Mg intake  from grass  + hay may be below
27.5 g per cow.
The net availability  of dietary  Mg can vary from 5%-35%  of ingested  Mg. In 
of dairy  radon  and silage,  net availability  of Mg may be 20%-  
iU/c.  b^ific  Mg-antagonistic  factors  in lush grass  (high-K,  high-N,  high  fatty 
acid)  reduce  net availability  to 5%-20%.  Also,  lush  grass  passes  quickly  through  
the animal  thereby  reducing  the absorption  of Mg and trace-elements.  The net 
absorption  of dietary  Mg may  be halved  (Tables  2 and 3) in spring  (5.5 g per cow 
per day)  compared  with  summer  (12.4  g per cow  per  day.  Availability  of Mg may 
also be low  in lush autumn  aftermath.  Therefore,  Mg intake  must  be doubled  to 
maintain  the same  daily  absorption  of Mg on lush grass.
In mid-summer,  net availability  may be 20-35%.  On winter  pasture  with 
energy  deficits,  availability  may be less. The net absorption  of dietary  Mg may  
be halved  (Table  2) on winter  pasture  (6.9 g per cow per day) compared  with 
surnmCT  (12.4  g per cow per day).  Therefore,  Mg intake  on winter  pasture  must  
be doubled  to maintain  the same  daily  absorpdon  of Mg.
forages  are often deficient  (below  0.15%  
DM) for Iactating  cows.  Apart  from adverse  effects  on Ouid balance  and milk 
yield,  Na deficiency  can reduce  Mg absorption.  The provision  of salt helps.
68
Dietary  magnesium  requirement
Mg levels in feed for Iactating  cows should  exceed  0.20%  DM. If Mg- 
antagonists,  energy  deficits  or stress  are present.  Mg levels  in feed may  need  to 
be 0.30%-0.35%  DM or more.  Lush  grass  often  contains  less than half  of those  
levels.
Daily  absorption  of Mg from the digesta  is needed  to maintain  normal  blood  
Mg levels  in adult  ruminants.  To remain  in zero  Mg balance,  cows  must  absorb
2.5 g Mg for their  own  tissues  plus  0.12  g Mg per 1 milk.  Thus,  cows  giving  301 
milk  need  to absorb  (2.5 + 3.6) =  6.1 g Mg per day. As can be seen from  Tables  
2 and 3, net Mg absorbed  can be less than  the requirement.  In times  of acute  Mg 
shortage,  the Mg reserves  of adult  ruminants  can not be mobilised  effectively . In 
that case, release  of Mg from bone is inadequate  to maintain  plasma  Mg. 
Hypomagnesaemia  may follow  within  2 days.
Effects  of hypomagnesaemia
Apart from increasing  the risk of tetany,  hypomagnesaemia  influences  
productivity  in other  ways.  It may reduce  fe^ intake,  causing  a drop in mean  
milk  yield in dairy  herds. It reduces  turn-over  of Ca from  bone  in late pregnancy  
thereby  increasing  the risk of hyp)ocalcaemia,  milk fever  and uterine  inertia  at 
calving.  Therefore,  one should  aim to keep  blood  Mg levels  as normal  as possible  
throughout  the year.  This needs  more  Mg supplement  than is required  to reduce  
tetany  incidence.
Risk periods
Herd or flock hypomagnesaemia  is usually  confined  to Iactating  females  
especially  those  at peak  milk  production  or those  suckling  young.  The main risk  
periods  are: 1. Spring,  for 6-8 weeks  after  calved  cows  or lambed  ewes  go to grass  
2. Autumn,  in winter-milk  herds  on lush aftermath;  September  to March  in out- 
wintered  suckler  cows calving  in that jjeriod;  for 2-3 days after weaning  in 
suckler  cows.
Herd hypomagnesaemia  occurs  occasionally  with Cu deficiency  in suckler  
calves  from  3-6 months  of age. It is rare in older  dry-stock  but may  arise  if serious  
errors of feed formulation  occur. Once tetany is confirmed,  all susceptible  
animals  in the group  should  be fed Mg supplements.  To prevent  relapse  after  a 
tetany case is treated,  oral Mg supplements  are recommended  at twice the 
preventative  rate (see below)  for 2-3 days after treatment.
Mg supplements  alone  may fail to control  an outbreak  of winter  tetany  in 
suckling  cows.  In that  case  it is best to house  all calved  cows  and to increase  their 
feed supply  as well as providing  Mg supplements.
Prevention  of hypomagnesaemia
Prevention  is discussed  under  three  heading:  Mg supplements,  stress  and Mg 
antagonists.
1. Magnesium  supplements
Mg supplementation  does not build  up a usable  reserve  of Mg. Omission  of
69
the supplement  for 1-2 days during  risk periods  can leave  the herd at risk from  
tetany  if stress  factors  arise.
Calcined  magnesite  contains  about  85% magnesium  oxide (Mg 0) which  
contains  60% Mg. Thus,  calcined  magnesite  contains  (85 x 60/100)  = 51%  Mg.
A supplementof  6-14  g Mg per  cow  per  day reduces  tetany  incidence  in spring  
and autumn.  However,  much  larger  doses  (20-60  g Mg per day) are needed  to 
maintain  group  mean blood  Mg in the normal  range.  This may be essential  to 
maintain  p)eak  milk  yield  in dairy  cows.  Even  then, some  cows  in the group  may 
have  moderate  to severe  hypomagnesaemia.  Even  30-60  g Mg per day may fail 
to maintain  normal  plasma  Mg and prevent  tetany  in beef  cows  suckling  calves  
on winter  pasture.
The three best methods  of preventing  grass tetany are feed medication,  
pasture  dusting,  water medication.  All three methods  are equally  efficient.  
However,  even with the best methods,  10-20%  of treated  animals  may have  
plasma  Mg levels  below  1.7 mg per dl (mild  hypomagnesaemia)  but well above  
those usually  associated  with tetany.
Provision  of 30 g MgO  per cow per day in the last month  of pregnancy  can 
reduce  the risk of milk-fever.  TTie supplement  is effective  if sprinkled  on easy-  
feed silage.  Alternatively,  100 g of a pre-calving  mineral  mix, high in Mg (15% 
Mg),  or water  medication  with a 15 g Mg per cow per day as a soluble  Mg salt 
is effective.
Cows  may consume  112 g (40z)  MgO  without  side effects  but 168 g (60z)  or 
more can cause scouring,  drop in milk yield and urinary  stones.  Under  no 
circumstances  should  high-Mg  feeds for cows be fed to calves,  dry-stock  or 
sheep;  severe  scour,  urinary  stones  and death  can result.  Also,  high-Mg  ewe nuts 
should  not be fed to lambs.
(a) Pasture  dusting
MgO  is available  in two forms,  fine powder  and granular.  Only  the powder  
form is suitable  for pasture  dusting;  granular  MgO  falls to the  soil and does  not 
dust the leaf. Dusting  requires  a good  quality  fertilizer  spreader.  Grass  height  
must  be at least 10 cm. The dust  can not adhere  if there  is inadequate  leaf  surface  
to carry  it. Dusting  must  be even because  given  the chance,  cows  prefer  to graze  
undusted  strips.  Lowgrade  magnesite  or dolomitic  limestone  has too litUe Mg to 
be of use. Soluble  Mg compounds  (sulphate,  chloride,  acetate)  are unsuitable  
because  rain can wash them off the grass.
Pasture  dusting  with 17-20  kg per ha of MgO is an effective  preventative.  
Sufficient  paddocks  can be dusted  to supply 1 week ’s grazing.  Set-stocked  
systems  need 34 kg MgO  per ha, repeated  every  2 weeks.  The cows  are kept  on 
treated  pasture  until the risk is over. Dusting  is economical  at stocking  rates  of
2.5 cows  or more  per ha. It is expensive  at low stocking  rates.
(b) Magnesium  supplements  in feed
Calcined  magnesite  is the cheapest  source  of Mg. It costs £145-£185  per 
tonne. Feeding  an extra  30-50  g Mg per day (60-100  g calcined  magnesite)  in the 
concentrate  ration  usually  maintains  normal  plasma  Mg in cows.  Farmers  who
70
mix their own rations  may include  those amounts  in the daily allowance  of 
concentrate.
Dairy  concentrates  from  a given  commercial  source  usually  have  a fixed  rate 
of Mg inclusion.  This can be a mistake  because  one formulation  cannot  suit 
widely  varying  levels  of concentrate  feeding.  For example,  a dairy  ration  with 
1.0% added  Mg would  supply  30-50  g Mg per cow per day (adequate)  if fed at 
3-5 kg per cow  per day but would  supply  70-90  g Mg (excessive)  if ffcd at 7-9 kg 
per cow pter day. A ration with 0.5% added  Mg would  supply  15-25 g Mg 
(inadequate)  if fed at 3-5 kg per  cow  per  day  but would  supply  35-45  g (adequate)  
if fed at 7-9 kg per cow per day. To cater for variation  in feeding  rates,  
compounders  may need to sell rations  with two levels  of Mg inclusion,  one at 
double the inclusion  rate of the other.  The “double  strength ” ration  may be fed 
at low levels  and the “half  strength ” ration  fed at high levels  e.g. a ration  with 
0.5%  Mg inclusion  fed at 7-9 kg per head  per day,  and one at 1.0%  Mg inclusion  
fed at 3-5 kg per cow per day. Fanners  feeding  6 kg of ration  could  feed 50/50  
of both rations.  In this way, the Mg intake  is kept within  the range  30-50  g per 
head per day at all levels  of concentrate  feeding.
This “ double  strength  and half strength ” principle  applies  to all mineral  and 
vitamin  additions.  If compounders  can be persuaded  to adopt  the principle  the 
feeding  of major  elements  (Ca, P, Mg, Na), trace  elements  (Cu, Co, Se, I, Mn, 
Zn) and vitamins  (A, D3, E) to stock  will  become  much more  precise  than is the 
case today.
If no concentrates  are fed and Mg is needed  indoors,  for example,  by suckler  
cows housed  on silage  after  an outbreak  of winter  tetany,  the correct  amount  of 
calcined  magnesite  can be sprinkled  over  the silage,  half  in the morning  and half 
in the afternoon.  If dry forage  (straw  or hay) is used, the forage  should  be 
dampened  before  sprinkling  with magnesite  to prevent  it from falling  to the 
bottom  of the feeders.
(c) Magnesium  supplements  in a palatable  carrier
After  turnout  to grass,  cows  may not be fed concentrates.  However,  a small  
amount  of carrier  may be fed to carry  the 60-100  g calcined  magnesite.  If 0.5 kg 
per cow  per day is fed, the Mg content  should  be 6-12%;  if 1.0 kg per cow per 
day is fed,  the Mg content  should  be 3-6%.  The composition  of the carrier  is not 
important,  as long  as it is palatable  and is fed daily.  The  carrier  can be commercial  
magnesium  nuts, cakes or cobs. These  are used widely  in Scodand  and the 
Netherlands.  Commercial  carriers,  such as, molasscd  beet-pulp  nuts are used in 
Ireland.  Home-mixed  carriers  include  rolled  barley  or beet-pulp,  grass-meal,  
pollard etc, to which 6%  molasses  is added.  Feeding  in the parlour  is preferable  
to group  feeding  as shy cows may consume  little or none if trough  space is 
limited.
(d) Magnesium  supplements  in water
MgO is largely  insoluble  in water  and is unsuitable  for water  medication  
unless  an agitation  system  is used to keep the MgO  in suspension.
Tlie common  soluble  salts  of Mg are the chloride  and the sulphate  which  are
71
both hydrated  and both 10% Mg, and a dehydrated  chloride  (25% Mg). The 
acetete  may  also  be available  but may  be more  expensive.  Water  medicaUon  with 
20^0  g Mg per cow per day as soluble  Mg salts (chloride,  sulphate,  acetate)  
eltectively  controls  and prevents  tetany  in spring  and autumn.  Medication  with 
more  than  40 g Mg per cow per day as Mg sulphate  may  cause  scouring.  Higher  
levels  of methcation,  up to 60 g Mg per cow per day, as Mg chloride  can be 
tolerated  without  scouring  but there is litUe if any extra benefit  as regards  
improved  blood  Mg status  over the lower  level of medication.
There  should  be no other  water  source  except  the medicated  water.  Medica ­
tion should  be confined  to water  offered  to Iactating  cows  or recently  weaned  
suclder  cows.  Water  medicaUon  with 10-15  g Mg per cow per day can also be 
used  m milkfever  prevention  (see  below).  Water  for calves  and dry-catUe  should  
not be medicated  unless  hypomagnesaemia  is diagnosed  in these  cattle.
Water can be medicated  by two methods:  dispensers  and pumps.  The 
dispenser  consists  of a 4-201 plastic  drum with a special  nozzle.  The daily  
allowance  of Mg is set at 20-30  g per cow per day. The required  amount  of Mg 
salt for the herd is calculated  as follows:
salO (kg/day)  = (number  of cows  x 20 x 100)/(1000  x Mg% in the
Examples:
(1 ) The dose  of Mg sulphate  (Epson  salts, 10% Mg) for a 50-cow  herd is (50 
X 20 X 100)/(1000  X 10) = 10 kg per day .
(2) If Mg stock soluuon  is used (Brand  X, 7% Mg), the amount  of Brand  X 
solution  for a 50-cow  herd  is (50 x 20x 100)/(1000  x 7) = 14.3 kg per day.
Half  the dose is given  in the morning  and half in the afternoon.  Half  of the 
day s dose  of Mg salt is dissolved  in water  in the dispenser^  or half  of the day’s 
dose  of commercial  Mg soluUon  is poured  in. Leave  7-12  cm of an air cap in the 
dispenser.  The nozzle  is attached  and the dispenser  is floated  upside-down  in the 
trough.  To ensure  that the trough  is emptied  by the cows  at least  once  per day 
water  volume  in the trough  should  be reduced,  using  concrete  blocks  or sand so' 
that  the watercapacity  in the trough  isabout4.51  percow.  Evenon  wetdayscows  
will usually  drink  a minimum  of 5-10 litres  of water  per head.  Thus  the trough  
of water  and its Mg dose must  be consumed  by the herd each day.
In the case of Mg sulphate,  while  20 g Mg per cow per day is satisfactory,  
higher  levels  cause  scouring,  drop in milk yield and other  problems.  If cows  
refuse  to drink  sulphate-medicated  water,  dilute  the trough  with 1-2 times  the 
volume  of fresh  water  and skip the next  halfday ’s dose;  then conUnue  as before.
It they  still refuse  to drink,  it may be  necessary  to reduce  the dose  but blood  Mg 
can not be maintained  in the normal  range  if the dose  is below  20 g Mg per cow 
per day. ® ^
Mg chloride  solution  (5% Mg) is available  commercially.  When  added  to the 
water  supply  at doses  of4(X)- 1200  ml percow  per day the chloride  solution  is safe 
and palatable  and causes  no depression  of water  intake  or scouring.
Pumps  medicate  the water  at a fixed  concentration,  dcpiending  on the setting  
of the dosc/watcr  ratio conpol.  They arc plumbed  into the water  pipe system,
72
either  near  the trough  or centrally  in the farmyard.  Plumbing  in at the farm-yard  
is not advisable  if young-stock  must drink  from medicated  troughs.  Accurate  
mechanical  pumps  operating  off water-mains  pressure  are available.  Most  
pumps  are expensive.
Water  intake  by cows  can vary from 10 litre  per  cow  per day on cold  wet  days  
to 73 litre (on hot sunny days). Therefore  herd intake  of Mg from pump-  
medicated  water  can vary  more  than  7-fold  from  day to day unless  the output  ratio  
knob  is adjusted  frequently  to compensate  for that All pumps  need  careful  day- 
to-day  adjustment  of the settings  if one is to compensate  for day-to-day  variation  
in water  and Mg intake.  However,  some  commercial  pumps  are used at fixed  
setting.  Yet they seem  to control  blood  Mg levels  effectively  in spite  of day-to-  
day variation  in water  intake.
Dispensers  are preferable  to pumps.  They  are cheaper  and they  ensure  a more  
accurate  day-to-day  supply  of Mg to the cows.
(e) Magnesium  in mineral  licks,  blocks,  mixes
For  adequate  prevention  of tetany  using  ad libitum intake  of blocks  and licks,  
the farmer  needs  to know  the Mg concentration  in the product,  the average  intake  
of product  per  cow  per  day  and the variation  in intake  between  cows  and between  
days.  Products  which  contain  too litUe  Mg or whose  intake  is low or variable  are 
not safe. The Mg intake  (g per cow per day) is calculated  by mulUplymg  the Mg 
level (g per kg product)  by die maker ’s figure  for intake  of product  (kg product  
per cow per day).  Products  which  supply  less than 30 g Mg per cow per day are 
not recommended.
Intakes  of 30-50  g Mg per cow per day in molassed  mineral  mixes,  blocks  or 
licks including  home-mixed  50:50 molasses:  MgO, usually  are effecUve  in 
preventing  tetany  but may fail to maintain  blood  Mg as effectively  as the more
controlled  systems  of Mg supplementation.
A home-made  50:50 molasses:  MgO mix can be offered  m tubs or halt-  
barrels,  one half-barrel  per  20-25  cows.  Twenty  kg molasses  + 20 kg MgO  would  
supply 50 cows  for 1 week.  Intake  averages  about  114 g mix  = 57 g MgO  - 28.5 
g Mg per cow  per day. The mix needs  sUrring  1 -2 Umes  per day; MgO  setUes  out 
especially  if rain dilutes  the mix.  This  allows  pooling  of molasses  on top and the 
intake of MgO  falls. Cows  can be trained  to the mix for 1 week  before  the risk 
period  This is done  by offering  a 5:1 molasses:MgO  mix at the start,  gradually  
increasing  the strength  to 1:1 over 5-7 days. Variants  include,  cattle  
minerals:MgO:Molasses  1:1:2 fed in tubs,  or molasses:MgO  m raUos  of 3:1 to
10:1 fed in ball feeders.  j , cn.cn
While  group  mean intake  pier day of palatable  molassed  blocks  or 3U.5U  
molasses : MgO  mix may  be adequate,  wide  variation  in individual  intake  of Mg 
supplement  is a basic problem  with all free-choice  systems.  Cow-to-cow  
variation  in Mg intake  can be up to 30-fold  on a given day and day-to-day  
variation can be large  also. Some  cows  consume  little  or none;  others  consume  
too much and may develop  side effects  e.g. scouring,  drop in milk yield,
subclinical  urinary  calculi.  ■ -ui
In suckler  herds or low-yielding  dairy herds grazed in inaccessible  or
73
marginal  are^,  methods  (a) to (d) may not be practicable.  Free  access  systems  
may be considered;  they are more  effective  than Mg bullets.
(0 Magnesium  bullets
Mg bullets  for cows  release  1 g Mg each  per day. Compared  with  30 g Mg per 
day from 60 g calcined  magnesite,  4 bullets  release  only 4 g Mg per day. Two  
bullets  may  not prevent  tetany  in cows,  although  they may  reduce  the incidence  
somewhat.  Even  4 bullets  may  fail to maintain  normal  blood  Mg in cows  but  they 
may  be the only  practicable  way  to reduce  tetany  risk in suckler  cows  on marginal  
land.  If they must  be used,  suckler  cows  need  at least  4 bullets  every  5 weeks In 
suckler  calf tetany,  2 bullets  may suffice.
(g) Soil fertilisation
Fertilisation  withMgisnotreliableasameansofpreventinghypomagnesaemia.
It IS ineffective  in raising  plant  Mg sufficiently  high  to overcome  low availability  
of herbage  Mg in spring  or on autumn  aftermath.
2. Stress  reduction  and feeding
Climatic  stress  can be reduced  by housing  during  periods  of harsh  weather.  
Planting  fast-growing  trees  or hedges  provide  useful shelter  for stock  at pasture.  
In some  countries  cows  at pasture  in spring  and autumn  are provided  with  cheap  
but effective  blanker  to protect  against  cold and damp. Rough  handling,  
unnecessary  use of sticks  and dogs  can be avoided.
Cattle,  including  dry-stock,  sometimes  “faint ” when restrained  in a crush.  
Hereford  catUe  are espiecially  susceptible.  The restrained  animal  may bellow,  
tremble  and smuggle  before  going  down  in a complete  faint. “Crush  tetany ” or 
fainting  may be confused  with grass  tetany  but most  cases  are simply  a form  of 
fear, unrelated  to hypomagnesaemia.  Releasing  the head-restraint  may suffice  
If not, pouring  cold water  over the animal ’s head and helping  it to its feet may  
suffice.  If this does not work,  grass  tetany  induced  by stress,  may be suspected  
and specific  treatment  should  be given  immediately.
The  intake  of grass  DM by freshly-calved  cows  at pasture  and the intake  from 
winter  pasture  can be well below  the cow ’s needs.  The DM intake  of a cow at 
grass  is about  3-4%  of body  weight. The quality  of winter  pasture,  or of pastures  
which  have  been  managed  badly  can be below  that  of spring  and summer  pasture.  
Supplementary  feeding,  especially  extra energy,  may be needed  where  DM 
intake  or quality  are suboptimal.
Suckler  cows  arc given  little if any supplementary  feed at grass.  In the case 
of outwintercd  suckler  cows the provision  of adequate  energy  and shelter  is 
crucial.  Many tetany  outbreaks  in out-wintered  cows fail to respond  to Mg 
supplements  but can be controlled  by housing  and provision  of more feed or 
better  quality  feed.
Many  winter  forages  need  to be supplemented  with  Mg. Diets  based  on silage  
straw  or poor  hay may contain  0.10-0.19%  Mg in the DM, levels  which are too 
low for cows in late pregnancy  or in lactation.  Forages  may also need to be 
supplemented  with other  minerals  (salt, phosphorus,  trace elements)  and vita­
74
mins  (especially  Vit A and  E). Winter  feed  analyses  for quality  and minerals  will 
indicate  whether  specific  supplements  are needed.
3. Reducing  Mg-antagonists  in the diet
Reduction  of Mg-antagonists  reduces  the severity  of hypomagnesaemia  and 
the risk of tetany.
As K fertilisers  have been used for many years now, some farms have  
excessive  K in soil in the grazing  areas.  Soil tests for K at 3-year  intervals  can 
be used to monitor  soil K. High levels  of K in the diet increase  the risk of 
hypomagnesaemia  and tetany.  Omission  of K fertiliser,  when  indicated  by soil 
K levels,  can save money  as well as reduce  the risk. Autumn  application  of K 
reduces  luxury  uptake  of K in spring  herbage.
Maximum  output  of pasture  DM  depends  on heavy  use  of fertilisers  (chemical  
or organic)  and on tight grazing.  High DM yields  have negative  and positive  
implications.  Intensively  grazed  pasture  tends  to be very lush.  The  adverse  effect  
of lush pasture  on the availability  of Mg and of many  trace  elements  has been  
discussed.  In addition.  Mg levels  in rapidly  growing  grass  are often  low,  less than 
0.20%  DM.  Heavily  lactating  cows  and  ewes  need  much  more  than  that  when  Mg 
antagonists  are present.
Heavy  use of slurry,  farmyard  manure,  poultry  litter should  be avoided  on 
grazing  land. Apart  from producing  lush grass,  they can reduce  herbage  palat-  
ability,  DM intake  by cows  and milk yield.
If hypomagnesaemia  is due to excessive  fat in the concentrates,  the fat level  
should reduced.
SUMMARY
Grass  tetany  is a clinical  disorder  of cattle  and sheep.  Signs  include  nervous ­
ness,  staggering,  recumbency , convulsions,  coma  and death.  Tetanic  animalscan  
die within  1 hour. Times  of high risk are:-
1. Spring,  for 6-8 weeks  after lactating  cows  or ewes  go to grass
2. Autumn,  in winter-milk  herds  on lush aftermath
3. September  to March  in out-wintered  suckler  cows  calving  in that period
4. For 2-3 days after weaning  in suckler  cows.
Grass  tetany  is associated  with hypomagnesaemia,  low blood magnesium  
levels.  There  is a genetic  component  in the control  of blood Mg level. Some  
animals  need  much higher  Mg intakes  than others  to maintain  normal  blood  Mg.
Stress  can trigger  hypomagnesaemia.  Tetany  is rare in dry-stock  but may  arise  
from  serious  errors  of feed formulation,  e.g. inclusion  of more  than 6% fat in the 
ration.  It can occur  with Cu deficiency  in suckler  calves  from 3-6 months  old.
Normal  plasma  Mg levels  in cattle  and sheep  are 1.7-3.0  mg per dl. In tetanic  
animals,  blood  Mg levels  arc very low (0.2-1.0  mg per dl) and the mean  plasma  
Mg level in the group is usually  below 1.3 mg per dl. Grass tetany and 
hypomagnesaemia  are usually  confined  to lactating  cows  or ewes.
Hypomagnesaemia  may  be clinical,  subclinical  or non-clinical.  Clinical  signs  
are those  of grass  tetany.  Subclinical  signs  are; reduced  feed intake;  reduced  herd 
yield in high-yielding  dairy herds;  reduced  release  of calcium  from bone and
75
increased  risk of milk fever  in dairy cows.  In non-clinical  hypomagnesaemia  
there  are no obvious  signs  of ill-heal^  or lower  productivity.  Many  animals  with 
plasma  Mg below  1.0 mg per dl do not develop  tetany  or other  signs. Many  
apparently  healthy  groups  may have  moderate  to severe  hypomagnesaemia.
Magnesium  is required  daily.  A low Mg intake,  compounded  by a low net 
availability,  greatly  reduce  the amount  of Mg absorbed  per day. Adult  ruminants  
depend  on daily  absorption  of Mg from  the feed,  as they  are poorly  able  to release  
Mg from their bone reserves  in times of Mg shortage.  Withdrawal  of Mg 
supplement  in high-risk  periods  can precipitate  tetany  within  2 days.
The prevention  of hypomagnesaemia  depends  on: Mg supplementation  in 
periods  of risk,  reduction  of stress,  and reduction  of Mg-antagonists  in the diet.
Mg supplements  for cows  include:  pasture  dusting  with powdered  calcined  
magnesite;  feeding  30-50  g Mg per day as calcined  magnesite:  water  medication  
with 20-40  g Mg per day as soluble  Mg salts  such  as, chloride,  sulphate,  acetate;  
access  to 30-50  g Mg per day in mineral  mixes,  blocks  or licks. Daily  supple ­
ments  for ewes  are about  10% of the daily  cow supplement.
Mg bullets  for cows  release  1 g Mg each  per day.  Compared  with 30 g Mg per 
day from  60 g calcined  magnesite,  4 bullets  release  only 4 g Mg per day.  Even  
4 bullets  may  fail to maintain  normal  blood  Mg in cows  but they may  be the only 
practicable  way to reduce  tetany  risk in suckler  cows  on marginal  land. If used,  
suckler  cows  need  at least  4 bullets  every  5 weeks. In suckler  calf  tetany  2 bullets  
may suffice.
The costs  of Mg supplements  vary widely.  Calcined  magnesite  (MgO)  is the 
cheapest  source  of Mg. MgO  in the feed  is the cheapest  and most  reliable  method.  
Home  mixed  50:50  molasses:magnesite  is the next  cheapest  but is less reliable.  
Commercial  products  for water  medication  and Mg bullets  are the most  expen ­
sive methods.
The reduction  of stress  and proper  feeding  reduces  the risk of tetany.  Tetany  
in outwintered  cows may not respond  to Mg supplements  alone;  provision  of 
adequate  energy  and shelter  are crucial.
Reduction  of Mg-antagonists  reduces  the severity  of hypomagnesaemia.  
Lush grass  passes  quickly  through  the animal,  thereby  reducing  the absorption  
of Mg and trace  elements.  It also  contains  specific  factors,  especially  high  levels  
of N, K and fatty acids  which reduce  Mg absorption.  If soil tests  indicate  a need  
for K fertiliser,  it is good  practice  to apply  it in autumn  rather  than in spring.  This 
reduces  luxury  uptake  of K in spring  herbage.  Reduction  of the fat level  in the 
diet is necessary  if hypomagnesaemia  is due to excessive  fat intake.  Supplemen ­
tary salt is needed  if sodium  levels  are low in feed.

The Impact  of Cap Reform  on Feed  Costs  
in Beef  Production
W. DUNNE
Rural  Economy,  Teagasc,  Dublin.
The decisions,  finalised  on May 21 1992, on the reform  of the Common  
Agricultural  Policy  (CAP)  sketch  the broad  outline  of the institutional  arrange ­
ments  within  which  the b^f industry  will be operated  in the 1990 ’s. Since  the 
changes  affect both the input and the output  side of beef production,  the 
adjustments  by farmers  are necessarily  complex  and this renders  an accurate  
assessment  of the outcome  rather  difficult.  Although  the adjustment  path will 
also be influenced  by many  of the detailed  operational  regulations  which  have  
yet to be finalised  the general  framework  is now largely  defined.  This paper  
examines  the impact  of CAP  reform  on:-
1. The evolving  relationship  between  commodity  support  prices.
2. Concentrate  feed costs.
3. Composition  of costs and returns  in beef  production.
4. The relationship  between  concentrate  costs  and the value  of silage.
The evolution  of commodity  support  prices
As in the original  CAP,  the market  arrangements  for cereals  occupy  a pivotal  
position.  An outline  of how  institutional  support  prices  for the main  commodities  
will evolve  over  the next  few years  is shown  in Figure  1. The institutional  prices

BEEF PIQMEAT MILK BEEF S NET
Fig. 2 - Price  support  levels  - livestock  to cereals  ratio
for cereals  are projected  to decline  by about  30%  and, while  it is not formalised,  
the intention  is that pigmeat  prices  will track those  of cereals.  Also there is a 
planned  reduction  of 15% over three  years  in the normal  intervention  price  for 
beef. However,  the level of reduction  in “safety  net” intervention  for beef is 
similar  to that for cereals.  The adjustments  to the support  price for milk are 
modest  compared  with those for meat  and cereals.
Livestock  product  to cereal  price  ratio
In all livestock  production  systems,  animal  feed is the main input  cost item 
and is a major  factor  affecting  profitability.  Cereal  prices  are the main  determi ­
nant of animal  feed costs. Hence,  some appreciation  of how the economic  
returns  from the various  livestock  production  systems  might  evolve  can be 
gleaned  from examining  how livestock  support  prices  evolve  relative  to those  
for cereals  (Figure  2). For milk  production  the indications  are that the profitabil ­
ity of feeding  concentrates  will increase  over the next few years.  For beef  the 
profitability  of feeding  concentrates  will increase  if beef  prices  are supported  by 
the intervention  price.  However,  if beef  prices  are dependent  on the “safety  net” 
for support  then the changes  in the profitability  for feeding  concenuates  will be 
marginal.  Since  it was assumed  that institutional  support  for pig prices  would  
decline  in line with cereal  prices,  the profitability  of pig production  would  be 
largely  unchanged.
Meat  price  ratios
The consumer  demand  for the different  typtes  of meat  is highly  dependent  on 
their  relative  prices.  The evolution  of the relationship  between  the institutional  
support  prices  for beef  and pigmeat  is presented  in Figure  3. If beef  prices  are
78
— BEEF  INTERVENTION  —F- BEEF  S NET
Fig. 3 - Price  support  levels  - beef to pigmeat  ration
supported  by the general  intervention  level it would  appear  that there  has been  
a decline  in the competitiveness  of beef  relative  to pigmeat  and this  could  decline  
even faster  in the future.  Figure  3 shows  that beef  prices  would  need  to decline  
in line with safety  net intervention  for beef  to remain  competitive  with  pigmeat.  
These  tentative  conclusions  can be garnered  from an analysis  of the changes  in 
the relative  supjxrrt  prices  of the various  commodities.  However,  it is difficult  to 
anticipate  with accuracy  what will happen  in practice  because  many of the 
detailed  rules  are not yet in place.  Furthermore,  market  prices  in the future,  as in 
the past, will also be influenced  by the relevant  EC Market  Management  
Committee ’s assessments  of the actual  market  situation  and the decisions  and 
actions  arising  from these  assessments.
Implications  for beef  producers
In Ireland  a profile  of beef  producers  encompasses  a range  varying  from  full­
time  commercial  beef  farmers  to various  “full” and “part-time ” farmers  who  are 
in beef production  for social as well as economic  reasons.  In fact there is 
considerable  evidence  that many of the farmers  who, either voluntarily  or 
compulsorily,  have  opted  out of other  farm  enterprises  continue  to produce  beef.  
For these reasons  beef production  is almost  as much influenced  by factors  
affecting  other  enterprises  as the factors  directly  affecting  the economics  of beef 
production.  Even  within the beef  sector  the changes  resulting  from CAP  reform  
arc many and varied  because  they affect  both costs, revenue  and volume  of 
production.
Implications  for cereal  policy
Significant  changes  in costs  and cost structure  arise  as a result  of the reform
79
of cereal  policy.  The main  changes  are summarised  in Charts  1 and 2. While  the 
reformed  system  will be phased  in over three years the transition  period  is 
ignored  to simplify  the presentation.  Under  the existing  CAP  policy  the income  
of  cereal  producers  is supported  by a relatively  high  cereal  price  and  the incentive  
is to maximise  output,  expand  the resource  base.  There  is also  free entry  into  and 
exit  from the sector  (Chart  1). In the “reformed ” system  the support  price  will be 
much  lower  and incomes  will be maintained  through  an area-related  payment  
which  will be conditional  on land being  taken out of cereals  (ie setaside).  In 
addition  the size of the area payment  will be conditional  on a National  or 
producer  area  quota.  Under  the new regime  the incentive  for the cereal  producer  
will  be to minimise  costs  and  possibly  to change  crop  mix and/or  to reduce  inputs.  
It is also  likely  that entry  into  cereal  production  will be restricted  by area  quotas.  
Quotas,  set-aside  and possible  future  quota  reductions  for cereals  all indicate  that 
more surplus  cereal  land” will become  available  for alternative  uses.  Tradition ­
ally, beef  production  has been the preferred  oudet  for this surplus  land.
Concentrate  feed prices
Under  the existing  CAP system  for cereals,  the price  of animal  feeds was 
primarily  determined  by the intervention  price for cereals  and this made  
concentrate  feeds  expensive  (Chart  2). This  in turn  provided  the incentive  to find 
cheaper  feeds  either  in the form of cereal  substitutes  and even  protein  feeds  or 
forages.  Under  the reformed  system,  the intervention  price  for cereals  will be 
considerably  lower,  cereals  and consequently  concentrates  will be a much  more  
competitive  livestock  feed.  For bovine  livestock  feeders  this raises  the possibil ­
ity of a new optimum  feed mix resulting  from the change  in the price ratios  
between  cereals,  cereal  substitutes,  protein  rich feeds,  grass  silage  and possibly  
even grazed  grass.
Teagasc  research  shows that concentrate  ration formulations  are highly  
sensitive  to the relative  price  of cereals,  cereal  substitutes  and protein  rich feeds
This study  also shows  that the sensitivity  of ration  formulation  to changes  in 
the relative  price  of ingredients  varied  greatly  between  countries  and for ration  
typ)es.  Ration  form  ulations  for The  Netherlands  provide  substantial  evidence  that 
the price  of cereal  substitutes  is pitched  at a level  to maximise  their  inclusion  in 
compounds.  This  would  indicate  that  under  the reformed  CAP  the existing  cereal  
to cereal  substitute  price  ratio will be largely  maintained  to ensure  maximum  
inclusion  of substitutes  in feeds. It is also likely that cereal substitutes  will 
continue  to be attracted  into the EC as long as there is a significant  difference  
between  the EC and the world  price  for cereals
Recent  Teagasc  research  indicates  that as the EC attempts  to align  its cereal  
prices  with world  prices,  feed ingredient  prices  in the EC will become  more  
volatile This in turn will increase  the variability  in the livestock  to feed price  
ratio and is likely to precipitate  the classical  pig cycles  and variable  meat  
prices'* ’’^.
The maize  silage  subsidy
There  were several  Teagasc  published  reports  over the last decade  which
80
outlined  the significance  of the declining  concentrate  feed prices in the 
Community  for the competitiveness  of grass  based  beef  and milk  production  in 
Ireland In the recent  CAP reform  agreement  the link between  the lower  
support  price for cereals  and the reduced  value of forage was recognised  
explicitly  when the area  payment  for cereals  was extended  on a pro rata  basis  to 
maize  silage  (Chart  1). As noted  by Dunne  1992,  the same  logic  would  equally  
apply  to the entire  grass  crop in Ireland It is certainly  difficult  to understand  
why the maize  silage  subsidy  does not equally  extend  to the "harvested  grass  
crop ” as this at least  would  be administratively  feasible.  The implications  of this 
for the economics  of feeding  grass silage  will be examined  later.

Some  implications  of the changes  in beef  policy
The existing  CAP  support  system  for beef  resulted  in beef  being  expensive  
for the consumer  and there was a financial  incentive  to switch  to "white  meats ” 
Chart  3). Under  the reformed  beef  regime  the price  of beef  could  be considerably  
i^uccd  for the consumer.  However,  cheaper  beef  does  not necessarily  mean  that ^f  secures  a greater  share  of the meat  market  if beef  is still expensive  relative  
to other  rncats.  If we accept  the earlier  scenario  that the reduction  in white  meat  
prices  will track the reduction  in cereal  prices,  then beef  prices  would  have to 
decrease  in line with safety  net prices  in order  to maintain  the present  beef to 
whitcmcat-  ratio  (ic a reduction  of about  30%. The implications  of this for beef 
producers  will be evaluated  later.
existing  CAP system,  the beef producer ’s income  is supported  
mainly  by the intervention  price for beef and this has been supplemented  in 
rrcen years  by premiums  for suckler  cows  and a single  premium  for male  cattle  
(Chart  3). Like all other CAP products,  there was no formal  restriction  on 
entering  or casing  beef  production.  In fact, the main incentive  was to increase  
the resource  base and maximise  output.  Under  the reformed  CAP  the interven ­
tion price  will be considerably  reduced  and "hcadage"  payments  substantially  
inertased  with the objective  of maintaining  producers  incomes.  However  
suckler  cow and catdc  numbers  will be constrained  by quotas.

The beef  producer ’s response
There  is limited  information  available  on the likely  response  by beef  produc ­
ers to this change.  Any  analysis  of the response  is complicated  firstly by  the fact 
that the "headage" will form  a large  proportion  of the producer ’s revenue  and the 
method  and timing  of the payment  of the premiums  are not yet finalised.  
Secondly,  beef  production  in Ireland  consists  of a series  of almost  autonomous  
sub systems  which  will also  respond  to the methods  of paying  the premiums  and 
the changes  in the relative  cost of concentrate  feeds.
Under  the reformed  CAP  further  expansion  in beef  production  is constrained  
by quotas  and the major  incentive  will be to minimise  costs (Chart  4). Since  
headage  payments  will be a major  component  of the beef  producer ’s revenue  it 
is likely  there  will be a change  in the production  mix. As a consequence  of the 
changes  in the method  of paying  the beef  producer  and the changes  in the animal  
feed cost structure  there  will be a new optimum  balance  between:-
a) the value  of “keeping  the animal  alive ” and the value  of its carcass,
b) the cost and returns  from animal  maintenance  and growth,
c) the cost and value of animal  performance  at grass compared  with 
overwintering.
Finding  the new optimum  mix is rather  complex  because  there  are a number  
of variables  involved  and some  of which are not easy to quantify.  Furthermore,  
the introduction  of quotas  and possible  quota  reductions  for most  of the main  land 
based  enterprises  has resulted  in “surplus ” land  and altered  the opportunity  cost 
of land.
Costs  and returns  post CAP  reform
As outlined  above,  CAP  reform  affects  both the input  costs  and the revenue  
composition  in beef  production  and this complicates  the analysis  of future  trends  
of costs and returns.  In the future,  quotas  will be the major constraint  on 
production  expansion.  Milk and beef cow quotas  (other  things  being equal)  
constrain  the number  of calves  which is the primary  raw material  in beef 
production.  In the future,  farmers  will optimise  their  costs  and returns  based  on

The estimated  output,  costs  and gross  margins  per suckling  cow arc shown  in

under  CAP  reform  but the increase  would  be marginal  if beef  prices  decreased  
by 30 %. The reduction  in cereal  prices  causes  a reduction  in direct  costs  but it 
is small  due to the low level of concentrate  used. Interest  charges  also decline  
mainly  as a result  of the decline  in the value of the animals.  The estimated  
changes  in gross  margins  per suckling  cow is highly  sensitive  to the price  of beef

and to a lesser  extent  the level of interest  rates on capital.  Should  beef prices  
decline  by 30 percent,  the increase  in gross  margin  will be small  and will mainly  
benefit  beef  producers  with  moderate  efficiency  operating  on borrowed  capital.
Changes  in revenue  composition
The estimated  composition  of the revenue  received  by beef producers  is 
examined  in Figure  5. Under  the existing  CAP  arrangements,  headage  payments  
account  for less than 15% of producer ’s revenue  but under  CAP reform  these
88
payments  could  account  for almost  40% of revenue,  especially  if beef prices  
decline  by 30%. This has interesting  implications  for future  input  and output  
relationships  in beef production.  As the market  value of the finished  animal  
declines,  production  costs become  more important.  In the short  term the only 
costs  that are under  producers'  control  are direct  costs.  Should  the price  of beef 
decrease  by about  30% then  direct  costs  as a percentage  of the carcass  value  will 
increase  by about  20 percentage  points  (Figure  6). Indeed,  if interest  charges  are 
included  with direct costs for the excellent  producer  these costs would  be 
approximately  equal  the value  of the carcass.  For the moderate  producer  these  
costs would  actually  exceed  the value  of the carcass  by almost  30% .
Feed costs  and carcass  value
Since  animal  feed  costs  are the main  component  of direct  costs  it is appropri ­
ate to examine  feed  costs  in more  detail.  The  estimated  relationship  between  feed 
cost and the value  of the carcass  is shown  in Figure  7. Under  CAP  reform  feed 
costs  could  amount  to over  60%  of the value  of the carcass  and this in turn would  
focus  attention  on the cost  of winter  fodder  in particular.  Also,  the value  of winter  
fodder  (silage)  is coming  under  pressure  from  concentrates  as a result  of the CAP  
reform  for cereals.
Changes  in concentrate  prices
Under  the CAP,  the market  support  arrangements  for cereals  relate  primarily  
to wheat  prices.  Therefore,  the cost of obtaining  feed energy  from concentrate  
feeds  is mainly  related  to the price  of wheat.  When  CAP  reform  for cereals  is fully  
implemented  the intervention  buying-in  price  for wheat  will decrease  (assuming  
no change  in green  currency  rates)  from the current  level  per tonne  of £129.63  
to £87.88,  a price  decrease  of 32%.  The  actual  reduction  in feed  prices  is difficult  
to predict  as allowance  must  also be made  for changes  in the balance  between  
cereal supply  and demand,  transport  and processing  costs. Nevertheless,  the 
price  decrease  for processed  feed wheat  could  be of the order  of £50,  a decrease  
from about  £160 to approximately  £110 per tonne.  The evidence  from other  
studies  would  indicate  that there would  be a pro rata reduction  in the price  of 
energy-rich  concentrates.
The value  of silage
The breakeven  cost of obtaining  feed energy  from wheat  and grass  silage  of 
three different  dry matter  digestibilities  is shown  in Figure  8. It is clear  that as 
the price  of wheat  declines  the derived  value  of grass  silage  decreases  rapidly  and 
there is also a reduction  in the value  differential  between  average  and excellent  
silage.  For  example,  if wheat  costs  £160  per tonne  then silage  of 20% dry matter  
(DM) and 72% dry matter  digestibility  (DMD)  is worth  £28 per tonne  whereas  
when wheat  costs £110 the same silage  is only valued  about  £19 per tonne.  
Similarly,  the value  of silage  of 20% DM and 62% DMD declines  from a value  
of about  £24 to only  £16 per tonne.  It is noteworthy  that, the difference  in value  
between  the two silages  is about  £4 per tonne  when  the wheat  costs  £160,  but it 
declines  to £3 per tonne  when  wheat  is £110 per tonne.  Figure  8 shows  that as

the cost  of cereals  declines  the overall  reduction  in the value  of the silages  is of 
the order of £8 to £9 per tonne, this could be considered  the grass silage  
equivalent  of the maize  silage  subsidy  discussed  earlier.  Indeed,  future  investi ­
gations  might  interestingly  compare  the impact  on the seasonal  cost  of producing  
beef of such a grass silage subsidy  with that of the current  spring  slaughter  
premium.
It is obvious  from Figure  8 that under  the current  CAP system  cereals  and 
concentrates were  very expensive  relative  to grass  silage.  However,  in the post 
CAP  reform  situation  the cost differential  between  concentrates  and silage  has 
narrowed  considerably  with  an estimated  upper  limit  on the value  of silage  of the 
order  of £16 to £18 per tonne  depending  on its quality.
On Irish  farms  the cost  of making  silage  varies  enormously  depending  on the 
specific  circumstances.  For example,  the costs could  be extremely  low in a 
situation  where  crop  yields  are high  and the extra  costs  of growing  the grass  may 
only be the cost of the fertiliser  and the opportunity  cost of labour,  harvesting  
equipment  and land  are also  low.  On the contrary,  costs  could  be very  high  when  
land is rented,  grass  yields  are low and full contractor  charges  are incurred.  It is 
in this latter  situation  that  concentrate  feeds  are most  likely  to be competitive  in 
the future.

Selection  of Bulls  for Merit
A. J. GROGAN
Department  of  Agriculture  and Food,  Dublin
The conditions  under which  the Irish beef farmer  must now operate  his 
business  have changed  dramatically  in recent  years.  These  changes  have  been  
particularly  significant  under  the recent  modifications  to the common  agricul ­
ture policy. Intervention  prices are projected  to fall by 15% and will be 
compiensated  for by directly  paid premia.  Intervention  will account  for a much  
lower  proportion  of our overall  production  of beef in future.  In addition  the 
quality  aspects  of beef will demand  even greater  attention.  The production  of 
hormone/additive  free beef  of best quality  in terms  of fat levels,  conformation,  
and meat quality  must now be the priority  for every  farmer.  Producers  must  
therefore  develop  their  production  enterprises  to optimise  their  returns  under  the 
new EC support  regime  and evolving  consumer  demands.  Due  regard  will have  
to be given  to managing  quotas  and stocking  rate  limitations  to maximise  returns  
from premia,  however  significant  attention  to efficiency  and quality  of produc ­
tion will still be required.
This  paper  addresses  some  of the areas  relating  to the potential  for improve ­
ment  in the efficiency  and quality  of beef  production.  In particular  it will deal 
with the importance  of variation  within  breed and the potential  it offers  for 
improvement  in growth,  quality  and efficiency  which  are the traits  of primary  
economic  importance.  The relative  merits  of the different  breeds  for each trait 
are well  known.  For many  traits  there  is a significant  overlap  in the genetic  merit  
of the different  breeds  which  is not immediately  apparent  from breed  mean  
comparisons  but which  the farmer  should  be fully aware  of.
The genetic  basis  of phenotypic  performance
The appearance  and performance  of an animal,  its ‘phenotype ’, is governed  
by two factors:
- the genes  it inherited  from its parents,  its ‘genotype ’, and
- the extent  to which  that ‘genotype ’ is influenced  by the environment  
in which  the animal  is reared.
Although  significant  short-term  improvements  in performance  have  resulted  
and will continue  to result  from changes  in environmental  influences  such as 
housing  and nutrition,  improvements  resulting  from  changes  in the genotype  are 
in contrast  cumulative  and are passed  on from generation  to generation.  These  
genetic  improvements  are maintained  at no further  cost while non-genetic  
improvements  may continue  to require  ongoing  increased  costs in order  to be 
maintained.
Two  types  of traits  are of interest  to the farmer. TTie first,  the qualitative  traits  
such as coat colour  are governed  by one or at most a few genes and their  
phenotypic  expression  conveys  their genetic  basis or genotype.  The more  
important  group  however  are the quantitative  traits such as growth  rate, food

conversion  efficiency  and killout.  These  traits  are controlled  by many  genes  each 
contributing  small  components  with some  often  acting  antagonistically  to one 
another.
As already  stated  phenotypic  variation  is composed  of a genetic  and an 
environmental  component.  A trait for which a large component  of its total 
variation  is genetic  in origin,  is said to have  a high heritability  and will respond  
well to selection.  Table  1 includes  some  typical  heritability  estimates  for traits  
of economic  importance.  Also included  are estimates  of phenotypic  variation.
Figure  1 graphically  depicts  the variation  of a typical  trait which  follows  the 
normal  distribution  curve.  Most  of the animals  are concenffated  around  the mean
93
Fig. 3
or average.  Variation  in a trait  is usually  expressed  in units  of standard  deviation.  
An animal  whose  value  for a trait is over  one standard  deviations  from the mean  
comes  from the top 15% of the population.  Similarly  66% of the population  of 
animals  will lie between  plus and minus  one standard  deviation  from the mean  
of the population.  Thus for each trait, all breeds  will have means  and standard  
deviations  which  may be different  from each other.
Figures  2 and 3 compare  400 day performance  test final weights  and food 
conversion  efficiency  respectively,  averaged  for the continental  and non-conti ­
nental  breeds.  Differences  in genetic  variation  and means  are highlighted  in these  
figures.  It is important  to note that there  is a significant  area of overlap  between  
the two distributions.  This overlap  demonstrates  that there are significant  
numbers  of animals  in the breed  with higher  mean  values  which  are genetically  
poorer  than a large  proportion  of animals  in the breed  of lower  mean  value.  The 
message  would  be that once having  selected  a breed,  then select  the best from  
within  that breed  for economic  worth.
Genetic  improvement
Genetic  improvement  is primarily  concerned  with selection  for traits of 
economic  importance.  The response  to selection  is given by the following  
formula.
Response  = Intensity  X Heritability  X Standard  deviation  (ih^op)
Luckily  the traits of economic  importance  are highly  heritable  and have  
significant  levels  of genetic  variation.  It is therefore  under  the breeders  control  
to exploit  this potential  by applying  intensive  selection.  His objective  should  be 
to produce  animals  which  are likely  to have  a combination  of genes  which  will 
maximise  the efficiency  and quality  of overall  production.  He does this each 
season  when  he makes  choices  on what sires he will use to breed  to his cows.  
These  choices  can have very important  economic  consequences  for the beef
94
fanner  as they can significantly  influence  the final carcase  value  and costs  of 
production  of his beef  enterprise.  The opportunity  for selection  on the female  
side  is limited  because  of the high  replacement  rates  required  simply  to maintain  
the herd. This  restriction  does not apply  on the male  side especially  where  AI is 
used.  Thus  the farmer  has much  more  discretion  on what  bulls  he may use in his 
herd to sire the slaughter  generation  and thus exploit  the genetic  potential  
available  to him.
Genetic  evaluation
Over  the last  few decades  but  in particular  the last  fifteen  years,  the procedures  
by which  the genetic  merit  or brewing value  of a bull can be determined  have  
improved  dramatically.  As stated,  abull ’s visual  performance  is a function  of his 
genetic  make-up  and the environment  in which  he is managed.  In order  to make  
fair comparisons  of the genetic  merit  of different  bulls,  corrections  must  be made  
for these  non-genetic  factors  so that bulls  can be compared  on a standard  basis.
A bull’s breeding  value  can be estimated  with varying  degrees  of accuracy  
using  information  from;-
- parents ’ performance;
- the animal ’s own performance  (Performance  Test  Results);
- performance  of progeny  (Progeny  Test Results).
Currently  the Department  of Agriculture  and Food operates  the national  
evaluation  programme  for beef cattle. This programme  is carried  out in co­
operation  with the breed societies  and the AI stations. The important  
components  of the programme  are:-
- the on-farm  weight  recording  scheme  which  records  performance  in pedi­
gree herds;
- central  performance  testing  in the Tully  performance  test station  of young  
pedigree  bulls selected  mainly  through  the weight  recording  scheme;
- central  progeny  testing  of bulls  in AI centres  for beef  traits  on the basis  of the 
performance  of random  samples  of their progeny  and calving  ease deter ­
mined  from a survey  of over 2(X) calvings.
Beef trait and calving  survey  evaluations  are published  each spring  while  
performance  test results  are reported  at the end of each completed  test at the 
cennal  performance  test station  at Tully.
An ANIMAL  MODEL  BLUP  (Best  Linear  Unbiased  Predictor)  system  of 
genetic  evaluation  would  allow  the genetic  value  of bulls to be estimated  more  
accurately.  This is possible  because  the information  on all relatives  including  
their genetic  relationships  are built into the system.  This allows  performance  
records  on all relatives  to be used to estimate  the breeding  value of each 
individual.  It is hoped  to introduce  such an animal  model  BLUP  system  here in 
the near future.
Selection  for more  than one trait
A farmer  is generally  interested  in improving  a number  of traits  at the same  
time. Thus  some method  of combining  a bulls  evaluation  for the different  traits

into a single  figure  is essential.  Selection  Index  theory  provides  the solution  to 
this problem.  Using  relative  economic  values,  heritabilities  and genetic  and 
phenotypic  correlations  which  relate  traits together,  an index of merit  can be 
calculated.  The use of a selection  index  significantly  improves  the rate of genetic  
progress  in economic  terms  when  compared  to the alternative  methods  such as 
truncation  selection.  A new selection  index  for Tully  Performance  Tested  bulls  
to be known as the BEEF  MERIT  INDEX  will be published  from  January  1993.
Beef  Merit  Index  for Tully  performance  tested  bulls
In deriving  the index,  the most  important  economic  traits  to be improved  were  
considered  to be-
• final weight:
• food  conversion  efficiency;
• conformation  score  (EURO  grading  system);
• fat score  (EURO  grading  system).
As the bulls  are not slaughtered,  conformation  scores  and fat scores  must  be 
estimated  indirectly  through  other  traits such as eye muscle  area, fat area and 
muscling  which  are genetically  related  to them  and  can be measured  directly.  The 
traits therefore  used to calculate  the index  are:-
• final weight;
• food conversion  efficiency;
• eye muscle  area (ultrasonic);
• fat area (ultrasonic);
• height;
• fleshing  score.
In deriving  the appropriate  weights  to apply  to these  traits,  it was necessary  
to
• calculate  the economic  values  for the traits to be improved  (Table  1)
• estimate  heritabilities,  standard  deviations  and genetic  and phenotypic  
correlations  between  the different  traits (Table  2);
• apply  selection  index  theory  using  the above  economic  values  and parameter  
estimates  to compute  the weightings  for the different  traits.
• avoid  the need for two main indices  (ie one for measured  traits and one for 
visual  assessment)  and so it was decided  to include  visual  assessment  in the 
overall  beef  merit  index assigning  it a weighting  corresponding  to 25% of the 
overall  index  variation.

The relative  importance  of final  weight,  FCE  and beef  quality  traits  and visual  
assessment  in the beef  merit  index are approximately  the same.  In addition  four 
sub-indices  for growth,  feed conversion  efficiency,  carcase  merit and visual  
assessment  score  are calculated  (Figure  4). These  sub-indices  allow  the breeder  
to easily  establish  how good a bull is for each of the component  traits. Bulls  
scoring  110 or greater  for all indices  are from the top 15% of the population  and 
bulls scoring  90 or less come  from the bottom  15% of the population.

AI beef progeny  proofs  are currently  reported  separately  for growth  rate,

growth  rate will transmit  half  of this to his progeny  thus increasing  the average  
performance  of his progeny  by 5% of the mean  for that trait.
Calving  ease evaluations  are also published  for AI bulls. The figures  are 
estimates  of the values  expected  when the bulls are mated  to Friesian  cows.  
While  in theory  such evaluations  could  be included  with other  traits in a beef 
merit index, the determination  of the economic  cost of calving  difficulties  
presents  problems.  Accordingly  truncation  selection  is normally  practised  for 
ease of calving.
Summary
By choosing  a bull from the top of its breed  a producer  can expect  to increase  
his overall  profitability  by either  reducing  costs  or increasing  carcase  value.  A 
bull contributes  half the complement  of genes  to its progeny.  Thus  a bull with a 
breeding  value of plus 10% can be expected  to produce  progeny  which  on 
average  will be 5% above  the mean  of the population.  Such  potential  improve ­
ment  in one or more  traits  offers  a great  opportunity  for improved  profitability  
in beef production.  Use of the BEEF  MERIT  INDEX  for performance  tested  
bulls and individual  breeding  values for progeny  tested bulls is therefore  
advocated  in order  to optimise  genetic  progress  and maximise  profitability.

Quality  Control  of  Animal  F eedingstuffs  - 
Legislation
A. GARGAN
Department  of Agriculture  and Food,  Dublin.
1. INTRODUCTION
There  have  been  significant  changes  in Irish feed legislation  since  we joined  
the EC in 1973.  The  legislation  in force  at that time  was  concerned  primarily  with 
the manufacture,  marketing  and  labelling  of straight  and compound  feedingstuffs  
and mineral  mixtures.  In the meantime  practically  all of this legislation  has been  
replaced,  and to a large extent  supplemented,  by various  EC Directives  and EC 
Regulations.
The main objective  underlying  EC legislation  is to harmonise  existing  
legislation  within  Member  States  in order  to facilitate  trade,  while  at the same  
time taking  cognisance  of the purpose  for which  the legislation  was initially  
introduced  (to provide  information  on quality  and use, to prevent  fraud or to 
protect  animal  and human  health).  The  essential  difference  between  a Regulation  
and a Directive  is that a Regulation  is binding  in its entirety  and directly  
applicable  in all Member  States,  while  a Directive  is binding  in each Member  
State as regards  the result  to be achieved  but leaves  the choice  of form and 
methods  to the national  authorities.  Hence,  Member  States have somewhat  
greater  flexibility  regarding  the manner  in which  a Directive  is enforced.  All EC 
Directives  on feedingstuffs  are given effect  in Ireland  by means  of national  
Regulations  introduced  under  the European  Communities  Act, 1972  (S.I.  No. 27 
of 1972).
The  intention  of this  paper  is to provide  an outline  of our legislation  governing  
the marketing  of straight  and compound  feeds, feed additives,  undesirable  
substances  and products  in feedingstuffs,  bioproteins,  medicated  feeds  and the 
heat treatment  of poultry  feed. The various  national  Regulations  relating  to 
animal  feed are listed  in Appendix  1.
2. MARKETING  OF  STRAIGHT  AND  COMPOUND  FEEDINGSTUFFS
The Directives  on the marketing  of straight  (77/101/EEC)  and compound
feeds  (79/373/EEC)  and subsequent  amending  Directives  have  been  given  effect  
in Ireland  under  a number  of Regulations  (7,12,14,23).  This legislation  deals  
essentially  with the labelling  of feedingstuffs;  the aim being  to provide  farmers  
with accurate  and meaningful  information  on the nature,  use and analytical  
composition  of the feedingstuff  to the extent  that this can be determined  using  
methods  of acceptable  accuracy  and precision.
2.1 Straight  feedingstuffs
Scope  of regulations
National  legislation  on straight  feedingstuffs  applies  to all single  feedingstuffs  
sold to farmers  and also to materials  sold as feed ingredients  to compound  feed
99
manufacturers.  The Directive,  on the other hand, only applies  to straight  
feedingstuffs  sold to farmers.  However,  we availed  of a derogation  allowing  
Member  States  to adopt  similar  provisions  for feed ingredients.
The Schedule  to the Regulations  contains  a list of 152 materials  authorised  as 
straight  feedingstuffs  together  with  a description  and the analytical  parameters  
required  or allowed  on the label in each case. The particulars  contained  in the 
Schedule  for eight of the more common  straight  feedingstuffs  are set out in 
Appendix  2. Materials  not listed  may  be marketed  as straight  feeds  provided  they 
comply  with  the general  requirements  applicable  to all straight  feedingstuffs,  i.e. 
they must  be wholesome,  unadulterated  and of merchantable  quality,  and must  
not be harmful  to animal  or human  health  or marketed  in a manner  liable to 
mislead.
Quality  standards
Implementation  of the composition  requirements  (min.  crude  protein,  max.  
crude  fibre,  etc) set out in the Directive  is optional  to Member  States.  These  were  
not incorporated  in our national  legislation  as it was felt they could cause  a 
significant  increase  in the price  of straight  feeds  sold  to farmers  for home  mixing.  
Community  standards  were  however  fixed  for botanical  purity  (95%)  and sand 
and silica,  which  is determined  as ash insoluble  in HCl (2% in DM).  Materials  
sold to farmers  may not exceed  these  levels  but the standards  may be exceeded  
in the case of feed ingredients,  provided  the level is declared  on the label.
Labelling
A general  feature  of EC feed  legislation  is to prescribe  not only  the particulars  
which  must be indicated  on the official  label but also those  particulars  which  
manufacturers  mav indicate.  Other  information  is allowed  on the bag provided  
it is clearly  separated  from the statutory  information.  In the case of bulk, the 
statutory  information  m ust be provided  on a document  accompanying  each  load.
The compulsory  and optional  labelling  particulars  are set out in Appendix  3. 
The names  prescribed  for straight  feeds  are intended  to provide  some  indication  
as to quality  and feeding  value  (e.g. partly-decorticated  cotton  seed  expeller)  and 
this name  must  be used  if the materi^  complies  with  the description  given.  Terms  
like “Fatty maize ” are not acceptable.
The compulsory  and optional  analytical  declarations  vary depending  on the 
material.  In general,  the main analytical  parameters  influencing  the nutritional  
value  of the feed  must  be indicated.  For many  feeds  the full traditional  chemical  
analysis  is required  (protein,  oil, fibre and ash).
When declaration  of an analytical  parameter  is required  on a feed, the 
legislation  always  provides  for a tolerance  to allow for inherent  variation  in 
sampling  and analysis  and also some batch to batch variation.  The analytical  
tolerances  applicable  to straight  feeds  are set out in Appendix  4.
2.2 Compound  feedingstuffs
A licence  is required  to manufacture  compound  feeds  and mineral  mixtures  
for sale. To obtain  a licence  a manufacturer  must have suitable  premises  and 
equipment  and possess  a rca.sonable  knowledge  of animal  nutrition  and the
100
legislation  governing  the manufacture  of feedingstuffs.  Approximately  120 
firms  are currently  engaged  in the manufacture  of compound  feeds  with  about  10 
specialising  in the production  of mineral  mixtures/premixtures,  mainly  for 
licenced  compounders.
The Regulations  apply to compound  feeds marketed  for all domesticated  
animals  including  pets. Definitions  of the various  types  of compound  feeds  are 
provided  (complete,  complementary,  molassed  feeds,  mineral  mixtures  and milk 
replacers).
Labelling
All of the statutory  particulars  required  or allowed  on a compound  feed  must  
be indicated  either  in a display  panel  on the bag or on a label  attached  to the bag. 
In the case  of bulk  the particulars  must  always  be provided  on an accompanying  
document.
Details  of the information  required  on the label  are set out in Appendix  5. In 
addition  to providing  information  for the farmer  the indication  of the type  of feed 
has legal  significance  in determining  acceptable  levels  for additives  and, in some  
cases,  tolerances  for undesirable  substances.  Maximum  dose  levels  for additives  
are fixed  on the basis  of complete  feeds  and these  levels  may be exceeded  for 
complementary  feeds  but  only  in proptortion  to the amount  of the feed  in the daily  
ration.  In this country  compound  feeds for  pigs and poultry  are usually  complete  
feeds,  while  all compounds  for ruminants  are classed  as complementary  feeds.
Ingredient/category  declarations
The declaration  of ingredients  in compound  feeds has been a contentious  
issue,  both at EC and national  level,  for a number  of years.  As far as control  is 
concerned,  the main difficulty  is the analysis  of samples  with an acceptable  
degree  of accuracy  and precision.  The standard  laboratory  technique  used is 
microscopic  analysis  and years  of experience  is required  to provide  meaningful  
results.  The Member  States with most experience  in this area are Denmark,  
Germany  and the Netherlands  since,  for many  years,  their  legislation  required  a 
quantitative  declaration  of all ingredients  in a compound  feed. However,  a ring  
test, conducted  by the Commission  in 1987 to determine  the competence  of 
laboratories  experienced  in this area,  gave  very  disappointing  results.  In the case 
of qualitative  analysis,  the majority  of laboratories  could  detect  all ingredients  
contained  in the sample  although  some  laboratories  reported  false  negatives  and, 
worse  still, a few reported  false  positives.  However,  very variable  quantitative  
results  were  reported,  with errors  of + 100%  common  for a large  proportion  of 
laboratories.
A compromise  was subsequently  reached  between  those  Member  States  who 
supported  a quantitative  declaration  of ingredients  and those  who  opposed  any 
declaration,  whereby  manufacturers  must either declare  each ingredient  in 
descending  order  of its proportion  by weight  or declare  the categories  to which  
the ingredients  belong.  Categories  of ingredients  have recently  been agreed  at 
EC level and these apply in all Member  States  (Appendix  6). In drafting  the 
categories,  account  was taken  of the need to indicate  the origin  of the ingredients
101
within  a category  and also  provide  some  information  on nutritive  value.  Never ­
theless,  the list is a compromise  between  proposals  for as many  as 21 categories  
and for as few as eight.
Cereals  and oilseeds  were each subdivided  into processed  whole  seed and 
fractional  products  derived  therefrom,  as this was felt to be the most  meaningful  
split  for farmers.  A maximum  crude  fibre  standard  of 25% was set for a number  
of categories  in order  to prevent  the masking  of ingredients  of low nutritive  value.  
Ingredients  which  fail to meet  this standard  fall within  the category  “High  fibre  
materials ” and must  be declared  as such.  An exception  was made,  however,  for 
ingredients  which  contain  either  high  oil (> 5%) or relatively  high  crude  protein  
(> 15%),  as this was considered  to compensate  to some  degree  for the excess  
fibre.  The standard  for crude  ash (50%)  in the categories  “Land  animal  products ” 
and “Fish products ” is intended  to divert  ingredients  with excess  ash into the 
category  for minerals.  Minerals  containing  more  than 5% sand and silica  must  
be declared  separately.  This also applies  to any ingredient  used which  does not 
fit into one of the established  categories.
Analytical  declarations
The analytical  declarations  required  and allowed  on compound  feeds  are set 
out in Appendix  7. In addition  to the normal  proximate  analysis  for all compound  
feeds, lysine  is required  on pig feeds and methionine  on poultry  feeds. The 
declaration  of magnesium  above  0.5%  is intended  to provide  information  on the 
suitability  of the diet to prevent  grass  tetany  and this  should  be expressed  as total 
elemental  magnesium.
Energy  declarations
Although  discussions  started  in the early  80’s on the adoption  of a harmonised  
Community  system  for declaring  energy  in compound  feeds  for poultry,  pigs  and 
ruminants,  to date  agreement  has only  been  reached  on a model  for poultry.  Some  
progress  was made in developing  an equation  for pigs but discussions  were  
abandoned  by the Commission  several  years  ago due to priorities  in other  areas  
and lack of resources.  A common  system  for ruminants  was never  discussed  in 
any depth  and we are unlikely  to see much  if any progress  in this area  for several  
years,  considering  the current  legislative  position  whereby  Member  States  may  
adopt  their own national  systems  for labelling  purposes.
While  declaration  of energy  on poultry  diets is optional  for manufacturers,  
any declaration  made  must  be in accordance  with the EC system  (Appendix  8). 
For pigs and ruminants,  the Directive  provides  for an optional  declaration  of 
energy,  estimated  in accordance  with  official  national  methods.  Since  no official  
methods  have been  incorporated  in our national  legislation  (24), this means  that 
it is illegal  in this country  to declare  energy  on the feed label for these  species.  
The legislation  does not however  prevent  manufacturers  from referring  to the 
energy  content  of their  diets in advisory  or promotional  literature.
The EC poultry  equation  (Appendix  8) is the result  of pooled  data on 189 
compound  feeds  fed to adult  birds  at five poultry  research  centres  (DK,  G, F, NL 
& UK). The low residual  standard  deviation  (rsd) indicates  the precision  with
102
which  the equation  predicts  the in vivo  ME  of the trial diets,  while  the co-efficient  
of determination  (R^) indicates  the high  proportion  of the total variation  in the in 
vivo ME accounted  for by the equation.  The absence  of an intercept  has the 
advantage  that  the equation  can be applied  equally  to data  on a dry matter  as well 
as an  “as fed” basis.
Tolerances
The tolerances  to be applied  to analytical  data  on compound  feeds  are set out 
in Appendix  9. Unlike  straight  feedingstuffs,  tolerances  are fixed in both 
directions  i.e. when  the amount  found  on analysis  is greater  than  or is less than  
the declared  content.  However,  except  for  energy,  the magnitude  of the tolerance  
is not the same in both directions;  tolerances  for deviations  of less nutritional  
significance  (e.g. low crude  fibre) are set at 2 or 3 times  the equivalent  tolerance  
in the opposite  direction.
Prohibited  ingredients
Our national  list of prohibited  ingredients  has been replaced  by an EC list 
(Appendix  10). For a material  to be included  in the EC list it must  pose  a risk for 
animal  or human  health. Very  low nutritive  value  is no longer  adequate  grounds  
to prohibit  a material.
3. FEED  ADDITIVES
The additives  which  may  be used in feedingstuffs  and their  conditions  of use 
are specified  in the Regulations  (15,20)  giving  effect  to the Council  Directive  
on additives  in feedingstuffs  (70/524/EEC).  Community  legislation  in this area 
has reached  a good degree  of harmonisation,  since Member  States  may only 
allow  the use of additives  specifically  listed  in the Annexes  to the Directive  and 
then only subject  to the conditions  laid down.  To obtain  authorisation  in the 
Directive,  a manufacturer  must  compile  a dossier  in accordance  with  established  
guidelines,  setting  out the identifying  characteristics  of the additive  and the 
studies  undertaken  to demonstrate  efficacy  and safety for the target  species,  
consumers  and the environment.  An additive  is only approved  following  a 
rigorous  assessment  of this data at EC level.
Categories  of additives
The  various  types  of feed  additives  authorised  under  the Regulations  are listed  
in Appendix  11. The inclusion  of medicinal  additives  (growth  promoters  and 
antibiotics  for growth  promotion  purposes,  coccidiostats  and anti-blackhead  
drugs)  in the same list as nutritional  and technological  additives  may appear  
artificial  at first sight,  given their similarity  to medicinal  substances  used for 
prophylactic  and therapeutic  purposes.  However,  they were included  in the 
Directive,  which  was the first piece  of feed legislation  adopted  at Community  
level,  due to their  widespread  use in animal  feed and the absence  of Community  
legislation  on medicated  feedingstuffs.  The technological  additives  authorised  
have much greater  significance  in the manufacture  of pet foods than in
103
normal  compound  feeds  for farm animals,  with the possible  exception  of milk 
replacers.
Conditions  of use
The  conditions  of use for the various  categories  of additives  varies  depending  
on the possible  effects  of misuse  and the need to protect  animal  and human  
health.  Hence,  strict  conditions  of use are specified  for all medicinal  additives  
which  include  the category  of animal  for which  the additive  is authorised,  the 
maximum  age to which  the additive  may be fed, minimum  and maximum  dose  
levels and withdrawal  periods  where necessary.  On the other hand, most  
technological  additives  are allowed  without  any  restrictions  on use. The  situation
is somewhat  intermediary  for nutritional  additives  (trace  elements  and  vitamins).
Where  minimum/maximum  dose  levels  are laid down,  these  are fixed  on the 
basis of the complete  feed. Higher  dose levels  are allowed  for complementary  
feeds,  provided  the feeding  rate is specified  on the label and the amount  of the 
additive  in the total daily ration  does not exceed  the level fixed for complete  
feeds.
The mixing  of additives,  with  the exception  of medicinal  additives,  from the 
same  category  or different  categories  is flowed  provided  the components  are 
physically  and chemically  compatible.  Medicinal  additives  within  a category  
may  not be m ixed unless  the mixture  is specifically  authorised  in the Regulations  
(Two  or more  growth  promoters  or two or more  coccidiostats,  etc.).
Minimum  conditions  for the manufacture  of medicinal  additives,  and also 
premixtures  and compound  feeds  containing  medicinal  additives,  are set out in 
Schedule  3 to the Regulations.  Depending  on the type  of product,  manufacturers  
must have suitable  premises  and equipment  and employ  trained  staff. A moni ­
toring  programme  adequate  to ensure  the identity,  dose level,  homogeneity  and 
stability  of the medicinal  additives  used,  must  be undertaken.  Stability  testing  is 
not required  for compound  feed manufacturers.  Medicinal  additives  and 
premixtures  must be stored in a manner  which facilitates  identification  and 
avoids  confusion  between  batches  and in a dedicated  area of the plant  which  is 
locked  when  not in use. Detailed  records  covering  the intake  of raw materials  and 
the manufacture  and distribution  of all products  must  be maintained.
A licencing  system  has been introduced  for manufacturers  who  comply  with  
these requirements.  This system  facilitates  the distribution  of medicinal  addi­
tives which  may only be supplied  to premix  manufacturers  and, when  incorpo ­
rated in a premixture,  to licenced  compound  feed manufacturers.  Medicinal  
additives  or premixtures  containing  medicinal  additives  may not be supplied  to 
farmers.
Labelling
Detailed  labelling  requirements  are laid down  for additives,  premixtures  and 
compound  feeds.  In the case  of additives  and to a lesser  extent,  premixtures,  the 
level of all active substances  must be declared.  The requirements  for the 
declaration  of additives  in compound  feeds  are set out in Appendix  11. The level 
to be declared  is the amount  of active  substance  added to the feed. Normally  this
104
will be the total  amount  present  except  in the case  of trace  elements  and vitamins  
which occur naturally  in feed ingredients.  For these nutrients  the declared  
amount should  be interpreted  as the minimum  amount  present.
4. UNDESIRABLE  SUBSTANCES  AND PRODUCTS
The Regulations  in this area (16, 19, 22) cover  a range  of substances  and 
products  that occur  naturally  in feed ingredients  but which  can endanger  animal  
health,  or human  health  due to their  presence  in livestock  products.  Since  such 
substances  cannot  be totally  eliminated  from feedingstuffs,  their presence  is 
tolerated  at levels  known  to be safe or, failing  this, at the level of determination  
of the analytical  method.
Maximum  permitted  levels  are fixed for straight  and compound  feeds in 
respect  of each  of the substances  and  products  set out in Appendix  12. Unlike  the 
marketing Regulations,  the term straight  feeds  only applies  to materials  sold to 
farmers.  Feed  ingredients  for the compounding  industry  are not  covered  with  the 
exception  of aflatoxin  B, in specified  ingredients  (2(X)ppb)  and cadmium  in 
phosphates  (15ppm).  However,  discussions  are in progress  with a view to 
adopting  harmonised  Community  provisions  for feed  ingredients.  At this stage  
it appears  that, rather  than fixing  tolerances  as was done for straight  feeds,  a 
declaration  of the content  in the ingredient  will be required  when  it exceeds  the 
tolerance  fixed  for the corresponding  straight  feed.
Normally  the compound  feed industry has little  difficulty  in complying  with 
the tolerance  levels  laid down.  However,  in the case of aflatoxin  B1 great  care 
needs  to be taken with certain  feed ingredients  to ensure  compliance  with the 
tolerances,  particularity  in dairy  rations  (5ppb).  This  tolerance  is set at a very  low 
level in order to minimize  residues  of the metabolite in milk, as this 
metabolite  has been shown  to be carcinogenic  in laboratory  animals.
5. NEW  SOURCES  OF PROTEIN
These  Regulations  (13,18)  give  effect  of the provisions  of Council  Directive  
82/471/EEC  which  deals  with non-traditional  sources  of protein  use in animal  
nutrition.  The Directive  was adopted  in the early  80’s, primarily  to control  the 
marketing  and use of single  cell proteins  (SCP)  in animal  feeds.  In the 70’s the 
high price  of soya  and other  traditional  protein  sources  stimulated  considerable  
expenditure  in research  and development  on SCP ’s. However,  the price  differ ­
ential  dropped  significantly  in the 80’s leaving  SCP ’s uncompetitive  although  
the technology  is now  available  to produce  these  products  on a commercial  scale  
should  this become  economic.
The basic  provisions  in this Directive  are quite  similar  to those  for additives  
in that only products  listed  in the Annex  may be authorised  for use in Member  
States.  Manufacturers  must  demonsU'ate  the efficacy  and safety  of their  products  
to obtain  authorisation  in the Directive.
Products  which  fall within  the scope  of the Regulation  are SCP,  non-protein  
nitrogenous  (NPN)  compounds  (e.g. urea and ammonium  salts),  by-products  
high in NPN and amino  acids.  The only SCP to obtain  approval  so far is the BP 
product  “Prutecn ”. However,  this product  has never  been marketed  commer ­
105
cially  for economic  reasons.  Similarly  the use of NPN  compounds  in ruminant  
nutrition  has disappeared  in recent  years  due mainly  to the relatively  low price  
of vegetable  proteins.  Amino  acids  are the only prt^ucts  authorised  which  are 
currently  used by the compound  feed industry.  Several  sources  of methionine,  
lysine, threonine  and tryptophan  have been approved  and also two 
hydroxyanalogues  of methionine.
6. MEDICATED  FEEDS
Although  the Directive  on medicated  feeds  (90/167/EEC)  has not yet been  
incorporated  in our national  legislation,  it is possible  at this stage,  due to the 
nature  of its provisions,  to outline  the main requirements  as they will apply  in 
Ireland.
1. Compound  feed manufacturers  will require  a licence  to manufacture  medi ­
cated  feeds.  To obtain  a licence,  manufacturers  must  comply  with  minimum  
conditions  similar  to those  already  indicated  for medicinal  additives.
2. Only authorised  medicated  pre-mixtures  may be used to manufacture  
medicated  feeds  and only in accordance  with the conditions  on the product  
licence.  Member  States  still retain  the right to evaluate  and approve  medi ­
cated pre-mixtures;  the National  Drugs  Advisory  Board  is the competent  
authority  in Ireland.
3. A medicated  feedingstuff  may only be supplied  to a farmer  on presentation  
of a veterinary  prescription  which is only valid for one treaunent.  A 
veterinarian  may  only  issue  a prescription  for animals  under  his professional  
care and only in respect  of such quantities  of feed as are necessary  for the 
purposes  of the treatment,  subject  to any maximum  amount  specified  in the 
product  licence.
4. Medicated  feedingstuffs  must  be supplied  directly  from  the manufacturer  to
the farmer  and, in the case of productive  animals,  the quantity  must not 
exceed  that  specified  in the prescription  and the material  must  not  be supplied  
in batches  exceeding  one months  requirements.
7. HEAT TREATMENT  OF POULTRY  FEED
An Order  (21) was introduced  recently,  under  the Diseases  of Animals  Act, 
1966, requiring  the heat treatment  of all feedingstuffs  marketed  for poultry.  
Introduction  of the Order  was prompted  by the recent  outbreak  of Newcastle  
Disease  and theopportunity  was  also taken  to introduce  standards  for potentially  
pathogenic  microorganisms  (Salmonella  and Enterobacteriaceae).
Essentially  all poultry  feed  must  be heat  treated  to a minimum  temperature  of 
75°C for one minute  at the core. In addition  to the requirement  to install  
automatic  monitoring  and recording  equipment,  most  poultry  feed manufactur ­
ers will need to modify  existing  pelleting  equipment  to achieve  this standard.
Provisions  intended  to ensure  hygienic  storage,  handling  and distribution  of 
poultry  feeds  have  also been introduced,  together  with standards  for Salmonella  
(absent  in 25g sample)  and Enterobacteriaceae  (maximum  of 300 in Ig sample)

Control  of Cattle  Diseases  with Emphasis  
on Respiratory  Infections
H. M. GUNN
Veterinary  Research  Laboratory,  Abbotstown,  Castleknock,  Dublin  15.
With  the advent  of outbreaks  of major  diseases  in Europe,  particularly  during  
the 18th and 19th centuries,  a system  of controlling  the entry  of animals  onto  this 
island  was initiated.  Movement  of cattle  was limited  and Britain  was the main  
source  of what few cattle  were imported.  In the nineteen  sixties  a quarantine  
station  on Spike Island in Cork harbour  was brought  into use to hold and 
investigate  cattle  from  mainland  Europe  prior  to their  entry  into the national  herd.
While  this system  of control  of importation  of animals  by quarantine  and 
import  test requirements  may have  been considered  to have  been  disruptive  by 
some people,  in general  it protected  the animals  in the country  from major  
diseases.  Diseases  such as contagious  bovine  pleuropneumonia,  rabies  and foot 
and mouth  disease,  which occur in mainland  Europe  at present,  have not 
occurred  in Ireland  since 1892, 1903,  and 1941 respectively.  Undoubtedly  the 
operation  of an import  control  system  has played  its part in saving  catUe  in this 
country  from these  scourges.
Arrangements  for the completion  of the Internal  Market  of the EC were  
finalised  on December  31, 1992. Included  in this objective  of the Single  
European  Act  is the free  movement  of animals  and animal  products.  It is intended  
that animals  and animal  products  should  move  freely  within  the community.  
However,  this free movement  will be subject  to exemptions  on the grounds  of 
public  and animal  health  risks.
The animal  health  risks are based  on disease  classifications  agreed  by the 
members  slates.  Currendy  the Commission ’s classification  of diseases  may be  
divided  into three  categories.  In the first  category  there  are diseases  like  Foot  and 
Mouth  disease  and Rinderpest.  Such diseases  will be compulsory  notifiable,  
emergency  measures  (such  as a slaughter  policy)  will apply  for their  control  and 
the EC will pay 50% of the cost of controlling  outbreaks.  In the second  
classification  there are diseases  such as Brucellosis,  Leucosis,  and Johnes  
disease.  These diseases  are subject  to mandatory  or voluntary  control  and 
financial  contributions  from the Community  can be made available  when  
National  Eradication/Conu-ol  programmes  have  been approved.  The third  clas­
sification  is an unwritten  one which includes  all other diseases  which  occur  
commonly  in the European  cattle  population.
Due to the advent  of the single  market  the emphasis  is now changing  from 
national  controls  over the import  of animals  to one of control  exercised  by an 
individual  farmer  or group  of farmers.  The EC legislation  will require  evidence  
of freedom  from the diseases  listed  in category  one and most  of the diseases  in 
category  two, if animals  are to be moved  to another  country.  However,  control  
of the diseases  a.ssociated  with the third  classification  and some  of the diseases
116
in the second  category  will  be the responsibility  of the individual  farmer  or group  
of farmers  but not the national  authority.  This means  that farmers  can set their  
own criteria  for animal  health  requirements  and insist on the highest  health  
standards  if they so wish.  As a minimum  the agreed  “code  of practice ” for the 
importation  of animals  should  be adhered  to in order to reduce  the risks of 
importing  diseases  into the country.
There  is evidence  that some  "non-notifiable"  diseases  (i.e. some  in category  
2 and 3) exist  in more  severe  forms  in other  European  countries.  Such diseases  
may cause an enormous  financial  loss if they were introduced  and caused  
outbreaks  of disease  in cattle  in this  country.  Each individual  farmer  or group  of 
farmers  will need  to adopt  their  own mechanisms  to prevent  this occurring.  This 
may  be best  appreciated  by considering  the possible  defence  mechanisms  of the 
farm and the individual  animal.
The defence  mechanism  of a farm will  rest on importation  of animals  into the 
farm  which  have  been  shown  to be clear  of  a number  of diseases  after  having  been  
tested  for the same;  and/or  by a quarantine  system  for the farm. This system  
mirrors  the national  defence  system  that was in operation  up to this year.
An individual  animal ’s defence  or protection  mechanism  is based on its 
immune  system.  The immune  system  is involved  in killing  invading  organisms  
and is bas^  primarily  on antibodies  although  some  specialised  cells may also 
have a role to play.
Vaccination
If an animal  is totally  immune  to a particular  organism  it will withstand  
infection  with that organism  whether  this is a parasite,  a bacterium  or a virus.  
There  are different  broad  general  types  of immunity.  Innate  immunity  may be 
related  to a species.  For instance  horses  do not  suffer  from  foot  and mouth  disease  
although  they  may  be grazing  next  to infected  cattle,  and cattle  themselves  do not 
suffer  from  myxomatosis.  Passive  immunity  is the type  of immunity  thatanimals  
receive  in colostrum  where  antibodies  from the mother  protect  the young.  The 
treatment  with  specific  antisera  may act similarly  such  as is the case  with  tetanus  
antiserum.  Active  immunity  is the response  of an animal  itself  to a challenge  with 
a “foreign ” organism  either  in the natural  state  or in a modified  form in a vaccine.  
Some  forms  of active  immunity  may  be developed  in hours  whereas  other  forms  
may take  2 weeks  or more. While  natural  exposure  to organisms  may effectively  
protect  animals  (if they do not succumb  to severe  disease)  vaccination  is less 
random in that  one will know  that the animals  are really  exposed  and more  likely  
to be protected.
Nowadays  many  different  forms  of vaccines  are available  in Ireland.  There  
are vaccines  against  different  agents,  like parasites,  bacteria  and viruses.  While  
traditionally  only  killed  vaccines  were  available,  live vaccines  are also  available  
presently.  The route  of vaccination  also may  vary,  some  vaccines  are given  via 
the traditional  intramuscular  or subcutaneous  routes, while more recently  
vaccine  administration  through  the oral or intranasal  routes  have become  more  
common  for vaccines  aimed  to protect  the digestive  or respiratory  systems.  
Vaccines  developed  through  sophisticated  technological  procedures  in labora-
117
lories  - genetic  engineering  - will play a more  important  role in disease  control  
in the future.  Such  vaccines,  produced  by selecting  only parts  of the organisms  
in a laboratory  may be able to confer  immunity  on animals  without  the danger  
of causing  disease.  Likewise  by using  sophisticated  carrying  agents  it may be 
possible  to enhance  the effectiveness  and  protective  nature  of some  vaccines.  An 
example  of the latter  is the very successful  use of a virus  - the vaccinia  virus  - to 
carry  parts of another  virus  - rabies  into foxes  - thus vaccinating  them and so 
assisting  in the elimination  of rabies from parts of Europe  in which  it was 
endemic.  Likewise,  vaccines  based on altered  organisms  having  detectible  
markers  which  allow their effects  to be distinguished  from those caused  by 
naturally  occurring  organisms  will be used more often in disease  elimination  
programmes.
Traditionally  the main  criterion  for licensing  a vaccine  was safety;  presendy  
and more  so in the future,  efficacy  will become  more  important  for vaccines  to 
be licensed  in the EC. Although  safety  will still be a primary  criterion  such 
efficacy  requirements  will be aimed  towards  long  duration  of immunity,  protec ­
tion against  a range of closely  related  organisms,  evidence  of the vaccine  
working  in the field  and having  an economic  advantage.  These  criteria  together  
with convenience  of use will be high on a users  agenda.  Such  efficacy  require ­
ments  will make  it more  difficult  to have vaccines  licensed  as companies  will 
need  greater  expenditure  to prove  some  of these  atu-ibutes  and if the criteria  are 
too strict  then it may not be worthwhile  for pharmaceutical  companies  to invest  
in vaccine  production.
Irrespective  of how  efficacious  vaccines  are, they  should  never  be considered  
as a substitute  for good  animal  husbandry.
Generally  disease  results  from  the interaction  of a susceptible  animal,  a poor  
environment  and disease  causing  organisms.  The importance  of the combination  
of susceptible  animals,  poor environment  and amount  of pathogens  in the 
environment  cannot  be overemphasised  in relation  to a disease  associated  with 
many  different  factors  like respiratory  disease.
While  vaccination  reduces  the possibilities  of animals  being  susceptible  to 
particular  disease  causing  organisms,  environmental  factors  and the organisms  
need further  consideration.
Environmental  factors
If we consider  the animal ’s environment  in relation  to respiratory  disease  we 
must  accept  that concentrating  animals  into a small  space  and housing  them for 
prolonged  periods  is unnatural.  In some  countries  it is the practice  to gather  cattle  
in large  numbers  outdoors.  This practice  undoubtedly  increases  the numbers  of 
pathogens  affecting  the respiratory  system  in the immediate  environment  of the 
animals.  If natural  air currents  do not dilute  or eliminate  such  pathogens  from  the 
immediate  environment  then a build-up  of pathogens  is likely to ensue and 
disease  may result. If animals  are put in an enclosed  air space with poor  
ventilation,  either  due to the intrinsic  properties  or siting  of the housing  or due 
to climatic  factors,  then there are greater  possibilities  for the build up of 
palhogensaffecting  the respiratory  system.  We have  reported  that  a period  of low
118
or no air movement  may be associated  with outbreaks  of respiratory  disease  in 
housed  cattle (Gunn  & Wilson,  1991).  Periods  of low or no air movement  
associated  with  mild  temperatures  put a strain  on the ventilation  systems  of cattle  
sheds  which  are based  on natural  ventilation.  This  system  of ventilation  is based  
on differential  temperatures  within  the shed being higher  than those on the 
outside,  thus  causing  convection  currents  to enforce  air changes  within  the sheds.  
When  such climatic  conditions  occur  sheds  that may  have  construction  defects,  
from  an air circulation  point  of vie  w or placed  in a sheltered  area,  may have  such 
poor  air change  rates  that a build  up of respiratory  pathogens  may  be inevitable  
in the unit.
If global  warming  continues  as expected , the mean  temperature  of the earth  
will increase  by 2°C by the year 2050.  This increase  in mean  temperature  will 
result in higher  ambient  winter  temperatures  and probably  even put more  
“strain ” on sheds  having  ventilation  systems  based  on convection  currents.
So while  cattle  in poorly  structured  sheds  will always  be likely  to be exposed  
to higher  concentrations  of respiratory  pathogens  than those  in sheds  with  better  
ventilation,  uncontrollable  climatic  factors  may also predispose  cattle  in well 
built sheds  to increased  concentrations  of respiratory  pathogens.
Respiratory  disease
TTie term respiratory  disease  is used to describe  infections  of any part of the 
respiratory  system  whether  it be in the nose (rhinitis),  larynx (laryngitis),  
windpipe  (tracheitis),  bronchi  (bronchitis),  bronchioles  (bronchiolitis,  alveoli  
(alveolitis)  and  pleura  (pleuritis).  Pneumonia  refers  to inflammation  of the lungs  
resulting  from infection  of the bronchi,  bronchioles  and alveoli  only.  Classifica ­
tion of respiratory  disease  may  be made  on an age basis  e.g. calf  pneumonia,  the 
damage  caused  to the lungs  e.g. cuffing  pneumonia,  or on an agent  basis e.g. 
hoose  pneumonia  etc. Classifying  the condition  on an agent  basis  is valuable  as 
it may allow us to do something  about  controlling  the agents  and hence  the 
condition.  The  common  agents  involved  in respiratory  disease  in cattle  in Ireland  
may be considered  under  the headings  of parasites,  bacteria,  mycoplasma  and 
viruses.
The role of the parasite  that causes  hoose  in cattle  cannot  be underestimated,  
as it is still a very common  cause of pneumonia  in cattle. Bacteria  and 
mycoplasma  are frequently  associated  with  respiratory  disease  in Ireland  and in 
other  countries  and  pasteurella  infections  may  be associated  with  viral infections  
in the condition  termed  “shipping  fever ”. The three viruses  most commonly  
associated  with  respiratory  disease  in Ireland  are Infectious  bovine  rhinou'acheitis  
(IBR),  bovine  parainfluenza  three (PI3) and bovine  respiratory  syncytial  virus  
(RSV)  although  other  viruses  such  as bovine  adenovirus  three,  rhinoviruses  etc. 
may  also  affect  Irish  cattle.  It is possible  to treat  parasitic  and bacterial  causes  of 
respiratory  disease  with anthelmintics  and antibiotics  respectively.  In general,  
antibiotics  may be used to kill a broad spectrum  of bacteria  associated  with 
respiratory  disease  but they do not have any direct  effects  on viruses.  It is not 
practically  possible  to treat  cattle  for viral diseases;  for this reason  vaccination  
for preventative  purposes  is required.  However  in general,  vaccination  has to be
119
aimed  at specific  viruses  that are associated  with an outbreak  of respiratory  
disease.
We have developed  techniques  at the Veterinary  Research  Laboratory  at 
Abbotstown  to detect  viral infections  associated  with respiratory  disease  which  
are more rapid and frequently  more specific  than previously  available  tech­
niques.  They  also allow  us to define  viral  infections  in live animals  which  were  
not possible  previously.  The information  gained  by the use of these  techniques  
has given us a greater  insight  into the factors  and agents  associated  with 
respiratory  disease  in animals  in Ireland.  For instance,  by investigating  the 
records  of tests carried  out at the laboratory  during  the 1991/1992  autumn,  
winter,  spring  period  it was possible  to determine  that 63% of severe  outbreaks  
of respiratory  disease  in cattle  in Ireland  were  associated  with viral infections.
These  tests are based  on the use of specific  antibodies  to individual  viruses  
produced  at the laboratory  which are linked  to dyes which fluoresce  when 
exposed  to particular  wavelengths  of light  and in this way locate  cells that are 
infected  with the virus.  The infected  cells  themselves  fluoresce  when examined  
under  a microscope  with facilities  for producing  the specific  wavelengths  of 
light.
If we breakdown  the cases into the specific  viral agents  associated  with 
respiratory  infections  in cattle  during  the above  mentioned  period,  46% were  
associated  with IBR infections,  31% associated  with RSV infections  and 23% 
associated  with PI3 infections.  These  three viruses  have their own specific  
lifestyles  and although  generally  difficult  to identify  by observations  on live 
animals,  they may act on different  parts  of the respiratory  system  and in extreme  
cases have easily distinguishable  effects.  At the present  time it is worth  
considering  one of these  - IBR - more  closely.
IBR belongs  to the herpesvirus  family  and can exist in animals  which  are 
clinically  normal  (carriers)  and be reactivated  and excreted  by these animals.  
More  severe  strains  of this virus  exist in animals  in both mainland  Europe  and 
in Britain.  For this reason  a policy  of controlling  the importation  of IBR carrier  
(antibody  positive)  animals  was pursued  by the authorities  in this country.  These  
severe  strains  are associated  with much more severe  respiratory  disease  than 
strains  presently  in the country.  Infections  with such severe  strains  have been  
reported  to be associated  with mortalities  of 15% or more  of infected  animals.  
Also,  these strains  can cause  severe  respiratory  disease  in cows  and infertility  
problems  in susceptible  females.  Our cattle  population  could  well do without  
such infections,  hence the logic of only importing  IBR antibody  negative  
animals.  However  one importation  of animals  carrying  such  severe  strains  could  
eventually  be enough  to contaminate  the entire  cattle  herd in the country.
The problems  associated  with global  warming  and the possible  inteoduction  
of more  severe  strains  of viruses  that effect  the respiratory  system  paint  a bleak  
picture  for in-wintering  cattle  in the future.  However,  recently,  a number  of live 
vaccines  against  the common  viruses  associated  with respiratory  disease  have  
been licensed  for use in Ireland.  Some  of these  vaccines  are based  on mutants  
of strains  isolated  form infected  cattle  and can  be used  in the face  of an outbreak  
of respiratory  disease  as they  act very  quickly  when  given  by the intranasal  route.
120
However,  their value will depend  on knowing  which virus or viruses  are 
associated  with the outbreak.
It must  be recognised  however  that respiratory  disease  is often associated  
with concentrating  and housing  cattle  and that the aim should  be to limit the 
damage  caused  by the syndrome.  For this reason  vaccination  policies  should  
always  be associated  with  good  husbandry  principles.  It is interesting  to note  that 
vaccination  programmes  against  viral  diseases  are standard  procedures  in other  
species  such as horses  and dogs.
On-going  investigations  are taking  place into the effects  of vaccinating  
housed  cattle  in Ireland  with live viral vaccines.
Management
Some  basic  management  practices  may help greatly  to reduce  losses  due to 
respiratory  disease.  Such practices  as trying to reduce  stresses,  by keeping  
animals  comfortable  and in small groups,  and recognising  social orders  in 
mature  animals  are all helpful.  Regular  feeding  is important  particularly  when  
animals  are moved  over great  distances  and to a number  of locations  or even  
from farm to farm.  Feeding  of colostrum  is also a valuable  aid in reducing  the 
severity  of respiratory  disease  in calves  as colostrum  will  also  contain  antibodies  
against  respiratory  pathogens.  The value  of “preconditioning ” (a term used in 
other countries  to describe  preparation  of animals  for movement  to other  
locations  using  such  practices  as introduction  to concentrates,  vaccination,  early  
weaning  etc.) of animals  to be sold has yet to be determined  under Irish 
conditions  as market  forces  will determine  its feasibility.  Obviously  buying  
directly  from farm sources  should  greatly  help reduce  disease  risks.
With increasing  knowledge  it may be possible  to reduce  the financial  costs  
of respiratory  disease  outbreaks,  currently  estimated  to be approximately  £35 
million  annually  in Ireland.
Conclusions
While  cattle  in Ireland  may be exposed  to greater  disease  risks in the future  
due to the possible  introduction  of pathogens  from abroad  and climatic  factors  
may stress  natural  ventilation  systems,  modem  vaccines  may help reduce  the 
risks  of severe  outbreaks  of respiratory  disease.  Nevertheless  good  management  
and husbandry  practices  should always  be used in conjunction  with any 
vaccination  regime.
Our forefathers  dealt  with the challenges  of their  day in their  own way. If we 
are to deal with the challenges  of the future  in a much  faster  moving  world  we 
need our own "foundations ” of basic knowledge  on which  to build suitable  
adaptations  to protect  the health  of the cattle  in this country.

Most  dairying  countries,  particularly  our EC competitors,  have  a compara ­
tively  uniform  milk  supply  pattern  throughout  the year. In Ireland  about  73%  of 
the manufacturing  milk is delivered  to the processing  factories  during  the six 
month  period  April to September.  Until the 1970 ’s Irish dairy co-operatives  
generally  paid an even price  for milk throughout  the year. The only exception  
was in the liquid  milk sector  The choice  of an optimum  calving  pattern  was then 
relatively  simple  Spring-calving  involved  much lower  costs  than alternatives  as 
milk production  could  be based  mainly  on grass The highly  seasonal  supply  
pattern  of milk as a result lias a number  of consequences  for processors  
Assembly,  processing  and distribution  facilities  have  low levels  of utilisation  for 
much  of the year,  resulting  in high  unit  costs.  In addition,  a highly  seasonal  milk 
supply  pattern  imposes  limitations  on the product  mix, as short life products  
cannot  generally  be manufactured  due to inadequate  supplies  of winter  milk.
For these  reasons  a number  of co-operatives  have  offered  price  incentives  to 
increase  milk  supplies  over  the winter  period.  The strategy  being  to switch  more  
calvings  to the autumn  period  of the year These  incentives  have provided  the 
dairy farmer  with a much more complex  problem  in deciding  on optimum  
calving  patterns.  He has to consider  whether  the price  incentives  over  the winter  
months  are sufficient  to compensate  for higher  milk  production  costs,  and when  
to calve  his herd of cows  to meet  the winter  milk requirements  The problem  is 
further  aggravated  now due to quota  restrictions
The shift in the milk supply  pattern  in Ireland  has been very small  over  the 
years  as can be seen from Table  1.

There  has been a slight  increase  in May to September  production  and an 
increase  in the production  of milk from  January  to April.  The trough  month  of 
December has  remained  unchanged.  Up to 1984, the calving  dates  were  getting  
earlier  but with  quota  introduction  the mean  calving  date for creamery  herds  has 
slipped  again.
The seasonality  question  has received  much  study (Gleeson,  1988,  Keane,  
1985 and Pitts, 1983).  In this paper  we plan to look again  at this question  from  
the point of view of milk production  and taking into consideration  recent  
innovations  from milk production  research.
Relation  between  lactation  yield of milk and milk constituents  and 
month  of calving
Most  attempts  to compare  spring  with autumn  calving  for milk production  
have,  in the  past,  generally  been  made  from  survey  data.  It has been  long  accepted  
that the autumn  calving  cow gave a higher  yield than the springcalving  cow 
because  it was still sufficiently  fresh in lactation  when turned  out to grass to 
increase  its yield and have a lengthened  lactation,  whereas  the spring  calver  
tended  to have a shorter  lactation,  going  dry in November.  Likewise  for spring  
calving  herds a delay in calving  date was always  associated  with reduced  
production  and a shorter  lactation  length.  An analysis  of 4 experimental  herds  
attached  to the Moorepark  Centre  over  a 4 year  period  is shown  in Table  2.

This  data shows  that there  was a linear  decrease  in the yield of milk  and milk  
constituents  with later  calving.  This was  also associated  with a shorter  lactation  
length.  However,  these results  do not indicate  the potential  of spring  calving  
herds  since  many  later  cal  ving  cows  are not purposely  managed  as such  but rather  
are the results  of lack of explicit  management  in regard  to month  of calving.  
Recent  innovations  from  milk  production  research  have  shown  that it is possible  
to substantially  alter the calving  month effect through  improved  grassland  
managementand  by altering  the system  of production  from  what  were  slandardi.sed  
systems  of milk production  based  on early  compact  calving  (Dillon  and Crosse,  
1992;  Gleeson,  1988 and Stakelum,  1991).
The pattern  of supply  of manufacturing  milk through  the year is determined  
by the calving  pattern  and quality  of feed available  through  the year and by 
management  decisions  such  as level  of concenuatc  feeding.  The supply  patterns

from  cows  calving  in different  months  have  been  studied  previously  (Killen  and 
Keane,  1978; Crosse,  1992). The shape  of these  curves  differed  from similar  
studies  in the U.K. (Woods,  1969). More recently,  herd performance  under  
different  calving  patterns  is being  monitored  in Moorepark  (Dillon  and Crosse,  
1992).  The results  of this milk production  experiment  were incorporated  into 
existing  studies  to derive  supply  patterns  for this study.  The  effect  of calving  date 
and herd supply  patterns  for different  calving  months  are shown  in Table  3. 
Similar  tables were also produced  for milk fat and protein  %. It should  be 
emphasised  that the curves  for the late spring  calving  groups  are not like the 
traditional  pattern  in Ireland  where  little  or no supplemenatry  feeding  occurs  in 
autumn.  Supplementation  in late lactation  is likely  to have an effect  on milk 
quality  as well as on milk yield.
Of particular  importance  is the supply  pattern  in the winter  months.  The  data 
in Table  4 illustrates  the effect  of calving  date  on supply  pattern  jter cow and on 
total supply.

Calving  date  has a large  influence  on the quantity  of milk  available  during  the 
winter  months  for processing.  It is assumed  that there is no difference  in total 
lactation  yield between  January  calvers  and October  calvers.
Price  incentives  to influence  the pattern  of milk supply
Until the 1970 ’s, the Irish dairy industry  generally  paid an even price for 
manufacturing  milk throughout  the year  and provided  no seasonal  price  incen ­
tives.  In contrast,  the liquid  milk trade  have  always  paid incentives  for the out- 
of-season ” months.  Bonus  schemes  were  introduced  to encourage  some  autumn ­
calving.  The bonus  incentive  was paid  provided  the farmer  met a specific  quota  
requirement.  An example  of some of the off season  bonus  scheme  paid by 
Dairygold  Co-operative  is shown  in Table  5.

are available  and these will be used to illustrate  how they might  affect  the 
decisions  a farmer  might  make  when  considering  how to maximise  returns  from 
his farm.
Monetary  returns
In order  to calculate  the monetary  returns  from farming  the following  Farm

The model  used is representative  of intensive  dairy farming  in Ireland.  A 
number  of alternate  systems  of production  were  compared.  These  are outlined  in 
Table  8. The main variable  with these  systems  was calving  date. Some  of the 
systems  also had a lower  stocking  rate. It should  be recognised  that if different  
assumptions  are made  then the results  can be different.

The data  in Table  9 show  that there  is a large  difference  in the costs  per Dairy  
Livestock  Unit  depending  on the system  of production.  The costs  range  from  
£479  to £600,  a difference  of £121/D.L.U.  The  additions  to costs  per D.L.U. and  
per kg of milk  quota  are also  given.  The  February  calving  system  is used  as a base 
to represent  early  spring-calving.  Systems  of production  where  early lactation  
milk  comes  from grass  has a large  influence  on reducing  costs.  There  is a total 
difference  of 2.04p/kg  (9.5p/gallon)  of milk  in the cost  of milk  quota  between  the 
MAR.  (L.S.)  system  and the system  of production  based  on October  calving  
(OCT.).

The  receipts  obtained  from  the various  systems  depends  on the system  of milk 
production  and on whether  or not the herd meets  the quota  requirements  for the 
high price  winter  milk incentives.  As outlined  in Table 10, the returns  for the 
various  systems  recorded  under the heading  ‘NB ’ assume  that no bonus is 
obtained  for any  of the milk  supplied.  They  are however,  other  possibilities.  Milk  
from these  various  systems  may or may not be part of a herd  meeting  the winter  
milk quota  requirements.  The receipts  outlined  for the various  bonus  systems  
outlined  in Tables  5 and 6 and shown in Table 10 assume  that the quota  
requirements  for the herd are met. Receipts  are highest  from the systems  of 
production  which  meet  the winter  milk bonus  requirements.
The margins  associated  with the  various  systems  of production  and where  the 
milk supply  qualifies  for the various  bonus  schemes  is shown  in Table 11. It 
should  be noted  that margins  reflect  the difference  between  the cost of produc ­
tion and the receipts  obtained.  Low cost systems  do not necessarily  mean  that 
these  systems  will give the highest  margins.

Margins  are highest  when  calving  is concentrated  to the start  of the grazing  
season  and where  additional  land is allocated  to the Dairy  Enterprise  (March  
L.S.). The margins  are lowest  for October  calving  when  no bonus  is received  for 
the milk.  This is due to the high cost  of production  associated  with this system.  
The margins  for the various  systems  change  markedly  if the milk  qualifies  for the 
bonus  schemes.
Given  the supply  patterns  (Table  3) and the estimated  returns  (Table  11), the 
optimum  calving  pattern  for a herd can now be estimated  by means  of linear  
programming.  The objective  assumed  for a model  dairy  farm is to maximise  net 
profit from the farm. The dairy farm is however  faced with a number  of 
constraints.  Firstly,  there  is the overall  Quota  constraint  for the whole  farm.  The 
quota  constraint  of 350,000  L (Table  7) is imposed  as an absolute  limit.  In terms  
of seasonal  quotas,  it is assumed  that the supplier  is obliged  to supply  the 
minimum  requirements  for various  times  of the year  as outlined  in Tables  5 and
6. The data in Table 12 show the precise  mathematical  solution  in terms of 
calving  pattern.

If no bonus  is available  then 76 cows is sufficient  to fill the quota  and the 
system  used should  be MAR.  (LS)  in order  to maximise  profit.  Nine  beef  cattle  
are needed  to use the remaining  land. Likewise  for the Late Season  (LS) and 
Winter  Bonus  (W.B.),  76 cows are required  but the systems  used or calving  
pattern  are different  to exploit  the Winter  bonus  (W.B.).  Here  62 (82%)  of the 
cows should  calve  in March and  14 (18%)  of the cows  should  calve  in October.  
In the case  of the early  season  bonus  74 cows  are necessary  to fill the quota  and 
42 (57%)  of these  should  calve  in March  with system  of production  MAR.  (LS) 
and the remaining  32 (43%)  should  calve  in December.  To exploit  the Waterford  
Foods  Winter  Milk Bonus  Scheme  (W.F.)  where  a greater  requirement  for 
Winter  milk  is imposed,  75 cows  are necessary  to fill the quota  and 13 beef  cattle  
to use the remaining  land.  Sixty  seven  percent  of the herd  or 50 cows  should  calve  
in March  (MAR.  L.S.)  and the remaining  25 cows  (33%)  should  calve  in October.  
The  total  number  of cows  required  to fill the Quota  differs  because  the yield/cow  
differs  depending  on the month  of calving.
The overall  farm margin  and a breakdown  of receipts  and costs  per cow and 
per gallon  of milk quota  are shown  in Table  13.

In a situation  where  no bonuses  are available,  the overall  farm profit is 
£48,852.  If the farmer  decided  that he wanted  to exploit  the early  season  bonus,  
the net result  is a loss of £681 per farm.  This is because  more  expensive  systems  
of production  have to be used to comply  with the supply  pattern  required  to 
qudify  for the bonus.  In practice  then  the farmer  should  ignore  this type  of bonus  
system.  The late calving  bonuses  and the winter  bonus  are very profitable.

The value  of milk  per cow increases  from  £892/cow  for the no-bonus  scheme  
to £968  per cow  for the (W.F.)  Winter  Milk  Scheme.  The various  bonus  schemes  
generally  resulted  in higher  value  milk quota  with the exception  of the early  
season  bonus  scheme.  Exploiting  the bonus  schemes  also  resulted  in additional  
costs  with  the exception  of the late  calving  bonus  scheme.  The  extra  value  for the 
milk was more  than sufficient  to compensate  for the extra  costs  involved.  This 
was particularly  so for the winter  milk schemes.
The milk yield  per cow and the seasonality  of production  are shown  in Table

These  results  show that the optimum  profit  was only achieved  when the 
minimum  supply  for October-February  was met in the case  of the winter  bonus  
schemes.  The supply  in the November-December  period  was above  the mini ­
mum requirement.  In farm practice  then, a safety  margin  would  need to be 
included.  The data in Table  16 show the effect  of increasing  the proportion  of 
October  calving  relative  to March  calving  (MAR.  L.S.) on profitability  and on 
seasonality  of supply  and on margins/gallon  of quota.

The  results  in Table  16 show  that increasing  the proportion  of October  calving  
reduced  the margin  obtained  per gallon  of milk  quota.  This  reduction  is offset  to 
some  extent  by the additional  returns  from the beef  component  of the farm. In 
farm practice  it is important  to allow  a safety  margin  when  considering  winter
130
bonus schemes  because  a failure  to obtain  the bonus  can result in a large  
reduction  in margin.
Conclusions
Results  presented  in this paper  show  that system  of milk  production  can have  
a large  influence  on the cost of milk production  and on the seasonality  of milk  
production.  Winter  bonus  schemes  can increase  the profitability  of the farm.  It 
is evident  from this study  that decision  making  on farms  which  will optimise  
profit  is a relatively  complex  issue  especially  when many  constraints  have  to be 
considered.  The  use  of  computer  aided  programs  such  as the “D  AIR  YPL  ANNER  ’ 
and linear  programming  greatly  facilitate  the decision  making  process.  These  
techniques  can also be used to compare  winter  milk incentive  schemes.
In considering  systems  of production  for the farm to optimise  returns,  the 
technical  requirements  for the various  systems  needs  to be carefully  considered.  
The cost associated  with changing  systems  of production  also needs to be 
considered  before  a final decision  is made.  The influence  of system  of milk 
production  on calf  rearing  systems,  labour  requirement,  capital  requirement  and 
on farm buildings  needs  further  discussion.

Before  the advent  of m ilk quota  restrictions  on dairy  farms,  land  was the major  
constraint  to increased  milk output  from farms.  The dairy  farmer  had a dual  
objective  of increasing  milk  output  per cow and per hectare  (stocking  rate).  The 
major emphasis  was on improving  efficiency  on a per hectare  basis. The 
objective  now on dairy farms  is to continue  to maximise  profit  from the farm 
while  optimising  the quota  allocated  to the farm as well as the land area.
Early compact  calving  (mean  calving  dale in late-January)  coupled  with a 
high stocking  rate (0.38  ha/cow)  and a eoncentrate  input  of 500-750  kg per cow 
was advocated  as a system  of milk  production  in the pre-quota  period.  Earlier  
calving  was  justified  on the basis  that it resulted  in a higher  milk yield  per cow.  
This coupled  with a high stocking  rate gave a high margin  per hectare.  A 
Moorepark  survey  on the cost  of milk  production  has shown  that  the average  cost 
of concentrate  used  on dairy  farms  was 1.7p/kg  of milk  produced.  If milk  could  
be produced  with a much reduced  concentrate  input,  it should  be possible  to 
reduce  the cost of milk  production  significanUy.  One  possible  way  of doing  this 
is to calve  cows much  closer  to the start of the grass growing  season,  thereby  
reducing  the requirement  for feeding  high levels  of concentrates  post-calving.
Comparison  of three  systems  of milk production
In 1989, a three year project  was set up in Moorepark  (Curtins  farm) to 
compare  the biological  efficiency  of three  different  systems  of milk  production.  
The Moorepark  standard  system  (early  compact  calving;  System  A) was com­
pared  with two late calving  systems  (Systems  B and C; Table  1). System  B had 
a similar  stocking  rate to System  A, while  System C was  at a lower  stocking  rate 
(0.38  ha/cow).

The lower stocking  rate used in System  C allowed  the opportunity  to 
investigate  if additional  land would  help optimise  milk production  from later 
calving.  With the advent  of quotas,  the dairy farmer  has to decide  on the 
alternative  use of land. The lower  stocking  rale resulted  in the total production
132
of 8-9 tonnes  of settled  silage  per cow  for System  C, with  most  of the extra  silage  
coming  from  the 1st silage  cut. The extra  silage  was used  as a supplement  in the 
autumn  period  when grass growth  rate declines  and/or  alternatively  in mid­
summer  when  drought  conditions  can arise.
A total  of 75 Friesian  cows  balanced  for lactation  number  and milk  yield  were  
assigned  to the three  treatment  groups  in the Spring  of 1989.  Each  treatment  had 
its own farmlet  comprising  of 20 paddocks  per treatment  (System  A and B), and 
23 paddocks  per treatment  (System  C). NiU'Ogen  was applied  at the rate of 395 
kg N per hectare.  Silage  was conserved  from 9 and 7 paddocks  respectively  for 
first  and second  silage  cuts fortreatment  A andB,  while  12 and 8 paddocks  from 
treatment  C were conserved  for the first and second  cut, respectively.  The 
grazing  area received  18 kg P and 37 kg of K per hectare  in the autumn  of each 
year. The silage  cutting  area received  25 kg P and 111 kg K per hectare  in the 
Autumn  and a further  17 kg P and 74 kg K per hectare  after  Ist-cut  silage.  Slurry  
was applied  in the autumn.  The silage  areas  were  grazed  once  in spring  prior  to 
closing  for silage  (early  April).
The  results  presented  in this paper  are for the first  two years  of the expteriment. 
The study  will be continued  for one further  year.
Grass  production  and grazing  management
Figure  1 shows  the average  daily  growth  rates over the period  1982-89  and 
the growth  rates for the years 1990  and 1991.
Fig. 1 - Average  grass  growth  rate for the period  1982-92  and the 
average  growth  rate for the years  1990 and 1991.
Total  grass  dry matter  production  was 13.9,12.5  and 10.9 tonnes  on average  
for the period  1982-89,  the years  1990  and 1991,  respectively.  Grass  growth  rate 
in 1990  was above  normal  from  March  to early-April,  it was below  normal  in late 
June and early-July  and below normal  again from late-Scptcmber  to carly-
133
October.  Grass  production  in 1991  was  very  much  below  normal  in the May-June  
period  and again in September.  Table 2 outlines  the grazing  management  
strategies  employed  for the two years.

Milk production
The milk production  and milk composition  data for the three herds  for both 
years  are shown  in Tables  4 and 5.
In 1990, the milk yields  for Systems  A and C were significanUy higher  than 
for System  B. Milk fat, protein  and lactose  yields  were  significantly  higher  for 
System  C compared  to System  B. There  was no difference  between  Systems  A 
and B and between  Systems  A and C in terms  of milk constituent  yield.  Milk fat

compared  to System  A. In the second  year  of the experiment  (1991),  System  A 
had a significantly  higher  milk yield than Systems  B and C. There was no 
significant  difference  in milk protein  or fat yield.  System  A had a significantly

The breeding  season  was confined  to 10 weeks  for all three  herds,  1st April  
until 24th  June for Herd  A and 18th May until the 10th August  for Herds  B and 
C). In 1990,  all the  important  efficiency  factors  in reproductive  performance  arc 
within  the target  values  outlined  by O’Farrcll  (1984).  The fertility  performance  
was not as good in the second  year (1991)  for all three herds.  The calving  to 
conception  interval  was  greater  than the target  value  of 85 days  for al 1 three  herds  
especially  Herd  A. The  conception  rate to 1st service  for Herd  C was lower  than 
the target  value  of 60%. However,  there  was no significant  difference  between  
the three herds  in cither  of the two years.

Concentrate  and silage  supplementation
In-calf  heifers  and first lactation  cows  were  fed 1.8 kg of concentrates/head/  
day in the pre-calving  period.  Table  9 outlines  the concentrate  input (post ­
calving)  to the three herds  for both years.
Table  9
Concentrate  feeding  (kg/cow)
System A B C
1990 625 125 80
1991 735 305 80
The cows  in System  A were fed 7 kg of concentrates/cow/day  post-calving  
with ad-libitum  access to grass silage.  Concentrates  were phased  out after  
turnout  to pasture  (mid-late  April).  All cows  were  supplemented  with 0.5 kg of 
a high  calcium  magnesite  concentrate  until late May  in both  years.  In 1990  herds  
A and B were  supplemented  with 2 kg per cow per day of concentrates  from the 
1 8th to 28th  June  while  the animals  in herd  C were  fed grass  silage.  This  was due 
to poor  grass  growing  conditions.  In 1991 herds  A and B were  supplemented  with 
3 kg concentrates/cow/day  from  7th to 16th  May  and from  7th June  to 22nd  June.  
They were also fed 3.5 kg from 14th to 22nd September.  Herd B was also 
supplemented  with 2.6 kg from the 27th September  to 7th November.  The 
animals  in herd  C were  supplemented  with  silage  from  20lh  September  and 18th 
September  in 1990 and 1991 respectively  until housed  by night. During  this 
period  they consumed  approximately  1.50 tonnes  of silage  per cow. This silage  
was fed after morning  milking  over  a 1.5 to 2 hour  period.
Some  conclusions  from milk production  system  experiment
From  the 1 st two years  of the study  the following  preliminary  conclusions  can 
be made.
1. Similar  yields  of milk,  fat and  protein  can be obtained  with  late  spring  calving  
cows.
A lower  stocking  rate helps to optimise  the production  from later calving  
herds .
The higher  milk composition  levels  recorded  with the later calving  herds  
need further  clarification.2.
3.
General  management  issues  on dairy  farms
The most important  management  factors  relating  to later calving  are:-
1. Good  grassland  management
2. Correct  autumn  management
3. Compact  calving.
Good  grassland  management  is essential  for all systems  of milk production,
138
but it is even more critical  for later calving  since you are producing  a larger  
quantity  of total lactation  yield  from grazed  grass.
Figure  4 shows  the milk  production  profile  of cows  for the second  half  of the 
grazing  season  on three  different  sward  types  (Stakelum  and Dillon,  1990).
Fig. 4 - Daily  milk production  curves  for cows  grazing  high,  medium  
and low quality  swards  in 1987.
The higher  quality  pasture  supported  average  daily yields  of 19.7 kg/cow,  
compared  to 18.3 and 17.3 for medium  and low quality  swards  respectively.  The 
high  quality  swards  were  the result  of grazing  to 6.0 cm in the April-June  period  
while  the low quality  swards  were  the result  of lax grazing  (9-10  cm) during  this 
period.
In the past,  late spring-calving  cows  dried  off  in the autumn  due  to insufficient  
feed to maintain  milk yield. To allow late spring-calving  cows to have long 
lactation  lengths  of about  3(X) days,  addition^  feed will have to be introduced  
into the system  in the autumn.  This feed  may be in the form  of grass,  grass  silage  
or concentrates,  or a combination  of all three.  The lower  stocking  rate and the 
application  of niu-ogen  in mid-September  may facilitate  grazing  up to late 
December  (Herd  C) especially  in dry land  (using  the extra  silage  as a buffer  feed).  
The feeding  of a low level  of concentrate  (2 kg) may be economically  beneficial  
especially  where  winter  milk prices  are available.
With later calving,  compact  calving  is more critical,  so that the start of 
lactation  coincides  with the start of rapid grass  growth.  Delaying  calving  date 
will result  in a larger  proportion  of milk being  produced  from feed other  than 
grazed  grass.  While  in this project  the mean calving  date target  was the 15th 
March,  this may not be the optimum  calving  date for all  farms.  In dairy farms  
where  the expected  turnout  date is early March  (e.g. South  Munster)  then the
139
target  mean  calving  date should  be in late February  - early-March.  Therefore,  
adhering  to the target  values  outlined  earlier  are critical.

The Need  for an Effective  Dairy  Breeding  
Programme
K. WADE
Centre  for Genetic  Improvement  of Livestock,  University  of Guelph,  Canada.
Introduction
Too often in the past, the role of genetics  has been viewed  as nothing  more  
than a tool, used  by top pedigree  farmers,  in the promotion  of quality  breeding  
stock  for sale.  While  this aspect  may have  received  most  of the publicity  in the 
past,  it would  be naive  to see this as its only use: genetics,  and the creation  of an 
effective  breeding  programme,  is something  which  should  be considered  by any 
farmer  who has a clear  vision  of what  his/her  goals  are, and of the kind of dairy  
animal  right for his/her  economic  situation.  In this light, it should  receive  as 
much  consideration,  in the day-to-day  running  of the farm,  as Nutrition,  Pasture  
Management,  Health  Care,  Fertility  ^ogramme.  Calving  Pattern,  Replacement  
Policy  and all the other  constituents  of a programme,  designed  to make  the most  
of one’s resources,  under  a quota  situation.  Genetic  progress  represents  a small  
but significant  as well as permanent  change  over  and above  any other  manage ­
ment aids. It is for these reasons  that care should  be given,  not only to the 
programme  used  by an individual  on the farm,  but to national  and international  
policy  as well.  An effective  breeding  programme  is only  possible  if the trait  being  
improved  has a reasonable  amount  of genetic  variation;  no variation  implies  that 
all animals  are genetically  equal  and that  any differences  are due to management  
or other  environmental  factors.  Fortunately,  there  is genetic  variation  for most  
production  traits  and it represents  25%  - 30% of the total - a substantial  amount.  
This  would  represent  significant  progress  were  it not for the fact that the genetic  
potential  of an animal  is invisible  to us. Furthermore,  traits  like milk  production  
are highly  quantitative;  they are comjxised  of hundreds  (perhaps  thousands)  of 
smaller  genetic  factors  (ranging  from something  like gut capacity  to the ability  
to convert  energy  to milk)  and one cannot  automatically  partition  the amount  of 
variance  by simple  observation  - it must  be estimated.  It is our knowledge  of 
genetics  that  allows  us to relate  the observable  trait (e.g.,  milk  production)  to the 
genetic  potential  of the animal  by means  of appropriate  statistical  modelling,  and 
it is this area which  has received  much of the research  during  the last twenty  
years.  While  finding  the most  appropriate  genetic  model  is essential,  and will 
continue  to be of high priority,  it is only the first step in a good breeding  
programme:  more  important  is what  we do with the resulting  information.  The 
following  four  areas,  their  relative  strengths  and their  interaction  with  each  other , 
define  the success  or failure  of that programme.
Monitoring  of genetic  trends
In some  ways,  genetic  trends  are simply  an “extra ” which  results  from our 
evaluation  programmes:  they are only available  after the fact and, as such,  are
141
incapable  of being used for the current  programme.  They are, however,  an 
indication  of how well the programme  is achieving  its desired  effect  as well as 
the speed  with  which  it is being  attained.  Genetic  progress  is a ratio  of the genetic  
superiority  to the generation  interval  of the four  genetic  pathways:  Sires  of Sires,  
Sires  of Dams,  Dams  of Sires  and Dams  of Dams.  Increase  the former  or decrease  
the latter  and genetic  progress  will improve.  While  there  is generally  a physi ­
ological  limit on generation  interval  at most farm levels - juvenile  MOET  
schemes  represent  some  of the most  extreme  methods  - calving  heifers  at two 
years old versus  three years old is one small example  of how a farmer  can 
contribute  to progress  at the farm level. With regard  to the other  component  
(genetic  superiority),  this is a function  of genetic  variance,  accuracy  of evalua ­
tion and the intensity  of selection.  The variance  is fixed (unless  some new 
research  shows  it to substantially  higher  than currently  being  used)  whereas  
accuracy  of evaluation  represents  limited  potential  and can be modified  mainly  
at the national  level  or higher.  Intensity  of selection  is the factor  easiest  to change  
at all levels  and,  simply  put, is the risk one is prepared  to take.  Should  one  choose  
only  the highest  rated  bull for replacements,  or, say, the top four  bulls?  The  same  
type of question  applies  to dams  of replacements.  At the National  level,  how 
many  planned  matings  should  be made  and how many  young  bulls  chosen  for 
progeny  testing?  Obviously,  there is more  risk associated  with choosing  a few 
rather  than many,  but the rewards  will also be greater,  on the average,  if we 
consistently  pick  fewer  sires  and dams  for future  generations.  Of course  this pre­
supposes  that everyone  is trying  to improve  the same  trait.  If this is not the case,  
one must  either  question  the policy  or provide  more  choice,  thus reducing  the 
potential  for improvement  in all traits under  selection.  The main  advantage  in 
monitoring  genetic  progress  is that it gives  an indication  of the success  of the 
programme  and whether  or not the maximum  possible  improvement  is being  
made.  It will also provide  an indication  of the length  of time it would  take to 
change  selection  objectives  (an example  of the need for this might  be the trend  
away from total production  - water  - and towards  solids,  either  fat or protein  
weight).  Therefore,  while the factors  which optimize  genetic  progress  are 
important  to the producer  (i.e., farmers  can play  a role in their  optimization),  the 
value  of the progress  itself  is of more  importance  to those  evaluating  the success  
of the programme  and deciding  on overall  policy.  It is the other  three factors  
which  affect  the producer  more  and, over which,  he/she  has more  control.
Increased  accuracy of evaluation
While  the movement  from  the Sire Model to  the Animal  Model was hailed  as 
a great  advancement  in terms  of accuracy  for genedc  evaluations,  it was by no 
means  a new concept;  Henderson  had proposed  such  a model  more  than  twenty  
years  before  its adoption;  it was,  in fact,  the obvious  way  to model  genetic  effects.  
Computers,  however,  were  the weak  link in the chain  in that there  was no easy  
way to account  for relationships  among  animals,  much  less a way to obtain  the 
solutions  to large  systems  of equations.  Therefore,  the Sire Model  was  proposed  
as an approximation.  However,  with Henderson ’s “rules for the relationship  
matrix ” in 1976  as well as later  advances  in computer  power  and algorithms,  the
142
door  was opened  for improvements  in evaluations,  allowing  us to do what  had 
been proposed  in the first place but dismissed  as impossible!  Consider  the 
example  data set in Table  1:
Table  1
Example  data set
Cow Yield Sire
1 5000 A
2 4300 A
3 6380 B
4 6800 B
5 5400 C
An evaluation  of these  records  can be performed  with either  a Sire Model  or 
an Animal  Model.  Both  methods  will give  proofs  for bulls  A, B and C, and both 
methods  will have accuracies  associated  with those proofs.  Based  simply  on 
observation,  one might  pick Sire B to have  the best effect  on improving  yield  in 
his daughters,  followed  by C and,  lastly,  A. In order  to add the genetic  component  
to the  evaluation,  knowledge  of the relationships  among  the animals  is required  
(see Figure  1). The problem  with a Sire Model  is that it only uses the known  
relationships  among  the sires  themselves;  from Figure  1, it will be seen  that A is 
not related  to B or C, and that the only relationship  to be added  to the equations  
is the link between  B and C (B being  the sire of C). In fact, the rankings  of the 
three bulls from this Sire Model  are the same as we might  have guessed  (B 
followed  by C followed  by A). It is not the argument  of this demonsu-ation  that 
a Sire Model  is no better  than  simply  using  average-daughter  production:  rather,  
the aim  of the example  is to show  what  occurs  when  the model  is changed,  and 
all known  relationships  are included  (see Figure  1 again).  Table  2 shows  the 
rankings  of the three  bulls  under  both models.  Some  might  find it surprising  to 
note  that,  under  an Animal  Model,  Sire A is now ranked  first. Careful  examina ­
tion of the relationships  in Figure  1, however,  will show  that  every  female  record  
is connected  to that sire; i.e., A is either  the sire or grandsire  of every  female  in 
the data set. Hence,  his genetic  merit  is estimated  from  all of the yields  to which  
he has contributed,  not  just  the two  poorest  - as was  the case  under  the Sire Model,  
where his proof  was based  solely  on his two daughters,  1 and 2. Likewise,  there  
is now additional  information  regarding  Sire B; he is the sire of C and,  therefore,  
has a genetic  input  into the yield  of Animal  5. Note  also that by using  an Animal  
Model,  genetic  rankings  arc available  for the females  as well as the males.
There  are many  advantages  to be gained  from the Animal  Model.  Firstly,  it 
uses all available  information  in an optimal  manner;  i.e., given  our knowledge  
of the biology,  this is the best way to model  it. It has good statistical  properties  
which allow  for more  accurate  predictions  to be made  concerning  the published  
proofs  and the performance  of progeny.  It adds  a credibility  to the proofs  when

comparing  them across  countries,  since most are now using Animal  Model  
methodology  as standard  procedure.  The final,  and perhaps  the most  important  
advantage  of the Animal  Model is the fact that  accuracy  increases  by an average  
of about  10%: this means  that bulls will reach  a proven  status  earlier  than with 
the Sire Model.  There  is no argument  among  researchers  as to the advantages  of 
the Animal  Model;  it is a question  of implementation,  and Ireland  is on the verge  
of introducing  such  an evaluation.  After  an initial period  when some  re-ranking  
of bulls  might  occur  (for the same  reasons  as demonstrated  in the example)  the 
consequences  for the national  programme  can only be positive.

Identification  of superior  animals
Identification  of genetically  superior  animals,  both male and female,  is an 
important  part  of any breeding  programme  and should  be viewed  on the global,  
the national  and the herd  level.  As the world  of commercial  genetics  becomes  a 
much smaller  market,  and semen  or embryos  of animals  with huge potential  
become  available,  certain  areas  need  to be examined  for each  buyer  (be it nation  
or individual  farmer). The current  method  for comparison  of bull proofs  across  
countries  is the use of Conversion  Formulae.  While  based  on certain  sound  
statistical  properties,  it should  not  be forgotten  that they  are still approximations,  
and that the only true way to compare  bulls  from  abroad  with national  contem ­
poraries  is to evaluate  them  in the same  country  with a representative  sample  of 
daughters.  The importance  of this last provision  is the assumption  that a bull is 
used  randomly  across  herds  and non-selectively  on cows  within  a herd  - neither  
of which condition  is usually  met. The result of evaluations,  where these  
conditions  are not met,  is biased  proofs  for the selected  bulls; i.e.,  those  bulls  that 
are used  non-selectively  will be given  higher  proofs  than  they  deserve.  White  this 
might  seem to be an argument  in favour  of conversion  formulae,  there is yet 
another  consideration;  implicit  in their success  is the assumption  that those  
animals  were selected  for the same trait in all the different  countries.  Some  
national  programmes  may still be selecting  on volume  (water,  essentially)  while  
the importing  country  is now focussing  on weight  of solids.  Once  the selected  
trait is different,  the conversion  formula  must use genetic  correlations  among  
trails,  adding  to the margin  of error.  Even if the trait appears  to be the same  in 
different  countries/breeding  programmes,  their is the chance  of a genotype  by 
environment  interaction.  The result  is, in fact, a different  trait even though  it 
appears  to be the same.  Unless  there  is a specific  study  done between  the two 
different  environments,  there is no accurate  way to adjust the conversion  
formulae.  All these  cautions  are not meant  to imply  that these  formulae  are of no 
use; they are still relatively  accurate.  It simply  serves  to indicate  that these  
conversions  are not foolproof  and may be the reason  why  a bull sometimes  does  
not perform  as the figures  in the originating  country  would  suggest.  There  is 
currently  a lot of research  being  devoted  to Global  Evaluations.  These  represent  
the “state of the art” in current  methodology  for evaluating  animals  (male  and 
female)  across  countries.  They  are restricted  to Animal  Model  evaluations  and 
have the possibility  to become  our most valuable  indicator  of genetically  
superior  animals  world-wide.  This also emphasizes  the need for Ireland  to push  
ahead  with its plans  to implement  its own Animal  Model methodology  so that its 
data can be incorporated  in the data base currently  being  formed.
On a national  level,  there  are other  factors,  besides  introduction  of the Animal  
Model,  which will enhance  the breeding  programme.  The selection  sequence  in 
the Irish Programme  is shown  in Figure  2. The stage  which  needs  examining  is 
the one which  selects  the top 50%  of young  bulls  based  on their  performance  test 
in a series  of beef  characteristics.  To date, this policy  has been  justified,  based  
on the argument  that the preservation  of a dual-purpose  breed is in the best 
national  interest.  Perhaps  it is time that this stage be re-evaluated,  given thq 
degree  of specialization  now being practiced  in all areas of agriculture.
145
placing  a pre-requisite  of beef  characteristics  on bulls  for future  use in the dairy  
indusU 7, there  is a high  chance  that  dairy  progress  is being  lost,  due to a negative  
correlation  which  exists  between  beef  and dairy traits.  It may also explain  the 
increase  in imports  of semen,  since  most  exporting  countries  have  narrowed  their 
selection  goals  in favour  of their  dairy  markets.  It is not that  the jx)tential  of these  
countries  for selection  is so much  greater  than ours  - as an example,  Canada  has 
approximately  2 million  cows,  versus  1.3 in Ireland,  but is one of the world ’s 
leading  exporters  of semen  and embryos  - but rather  a matter  of deciding  where  
to put the emphasis.  This  is not to say that  beef  quality  is unimportant  to the dairy  
industry;  it forms  an essential  by-pr(^uct  that  cannot  be ignored.  However,  it can 
easily  be argued  that both dairy and beef sectors  would  benefit  through  maxi ­
mum selection  of future  sires and dams  for dairy  traits along  with sensible  use 
of beef crosses  for the lower  portion  of the dairy herd. Due to the small (but 
constant)  rate of genetic  progress,  already  discuss^,  it is obvious  that  a breeding  
programme  which  maximizes  neither  dairy  nor beef  traits  will achieve  little  or 
no progress  in either.  Use of a beef  bull on that portion  of the herd,  not required  
for replacements,  represents  a better  method  for  obtaining  quality  carcasses,  than 
through  some small introduction  of beef characteristics  in the breeding  pro­
gramme  itself. While  there will be certain  reduced  profits  from the sale of 
Holstein  calves  for beef,  there will be greater  gains  from the production  of milk 
and the sale of animals  that are crossed  with specialized  beef breeds,  and 
arguments  concerning  the unacceptability  of beef  resulting  from  highly  selected  
dairy  animals  have long been dismissed  by other  countries,  where  there  is also 
an equal interest  in the preservation  of both industries.

146
Another  vital way to improve  the national  breeding  programme  is through  
enlarging  the data  base;  the more  records  that  are available,  the more  accurate  can 
be the bull proofs  produced  from the evaluations.  It also means  that the proofs  
will be more meaningful  since they will represent  a greater  proportion  of the 
producers.  Of the 1.3 million  dairy  cows  in Ireland,  only  about  10% are recorded  
in some official  manner,  thereby  allowing  those  yields  to be used in national  
evaluations.  This figure is closer to 50% in North America.  As soon as 
programmes  are developed  which convince  producers  of the value of milk 
recording  (even if it is only  through  unofficial  methods  for now),  the payoff  will 
be seen in terms  of national  bull proofs.  It is quite probable  that there is far 
superior  genetic material  scattered  throughout  the country  (in both  pedigree  and 
non-pedigree  herds)  than is currently  being  imported,  especially  given  the fact 
that those  potential  parents  are themselves  products  of the system  we are trying  
to improve.
Herd information/decision  making
The final - and arguably  the most  important  - component  to be affected  by an 
improved  breeding  programme  is the individual  producer  and his/her  herd. If 
good  selection  practices  are carried  out here,  then all other  levels  must  automati ­
cally  follow.  There  is a great  need  to believe  that genetics  are an important  part 
of any industry  which  is based  on getting  high production  from animals;  that 
individual  contributions  in terms  of official  records,  accurate  sire identification  
and use of young bulls are  vital when all are combined  in a national  policy;  and 
that use of the best bulls (foreign  or homebred)  represents  the best return  for 
money  at present,  provided  prices  are not over-inflated  due to demand.  Some  of 
these  points  need further  elaboration.
Use of the Relative  Breeding  Index (RBI),  as currently  calculated  by the 
Department  of Agriculture  is the best means  for selecting  dairy  bulls  for use in 
the Irish  dairy  herd.  The  reason  for this is two-fold;  firstly,  the RBI is based  solely  
on production  - that which  the producer  is paid for; and secondly,  its makeup  is 
such as to promote  an increased  weighting  on the solid  components  of milk (fat 
and protein)  and not on the water  comjxtnent  which  plays  so big a role in transport  
costs  and which  can always  be added!  Likewise,  the availability  of Cow  Genetic  
Indices  (CGI ’s) through  use of the Animal  Model  will allow  for an equivalent  
breeding  decision  to be made  regarding  females.  While  not currendy  as impor ­
tant a pathway  in genetic  improvement  as males  (due to A. I.), females  aie vital  
in the selection  of bull dams,  and their importance  would  increase  dramatically  
if MOET  schemes  were to become  more  widespread.
Using  a percentage  of young  bulls every  year is also a sound  policy.  These  
represent  our newest  genetic  material  and therefore,  on the average,  our most  
supterior.  Of course  the accuracies  on these  bulls  are lower  because  we know  less 
about  them,  thereby  increasing  the risk  that the one used may not be better  than 
what is already  available  at a proven  status. However,  one should  always  
remember  that probabilities  play a large  role in genetics  and that if a consistent  
policy  is adhered  to, there  should  be more  pay-offs  than failures.  Indeed,  many  
A. I. Studs in North America  arc now arguing  that the incentives,  so often
147
required  in the past,  should  be removed  as more  and more  f)eople  realize  the great  
ix)tential  of these  young  bulls  and assign  more  of their  females  to them.  It is up 
to each individual  to arrive at the percentage  with which he or she feels  
comfortable,  but that percentage  should  not be zero.
The last point  worthy  of mention  is to emphasize  the need  for increased  milk  
recording.  It is up to the recording  agencies  to supply  the extra  information  on 
nutrition,  action  dates,  condition  scoring  etc. which  will  convince  producers  that 
they are  not simply  validating  their  cows ’ yields.  As was noted  at the beginning  
of this paper,  the role of genetics  should  be more  than the promotion  of quality  
breeding  stock for sale; it represents  a substantial  way to improve  the farm  
income  through  methods  which  have been proven  over time both here and 
abroad.  Milk  recording  is something  which  every  farmer  should  consider;  if not 
through  the official  programme,  then initially,  through  some  unofficial  method.  
Only  when  a farmer  knows  how animals  are actually  performing,  can informed  
decisions  be made  on culling,  breeding  and use of beef  crosses.  Of course,  the 
more  of these  records  that can be used in national  evaluations  the far better  will 
be the pay-back  for all concerned.  Only  time  and dedication  by those  delivering  
such a service  can convince  those  involved  that it is, in fact, an advantage.
Conclusions
The adoption  of an effective  breeding  programme  requires  an improvement  
in attitude  as well as in technology.  Under  a quota situation,  the targets  for 
selection  need to become  increasingly  focused  as specialization  becomes  a 
necessity  rather than the luxury it has been in the past. Preservation  of a 
dualpurpose  species  needs  to be re-evaluated  not only  by the dairy  industry,  but 
also by the whole  agricultural  sector,  in light  of the fact that selective  use of high 
quality  beef  breeds  on portions  of the dairy  herd may represent  a more  efficient  
way of increasing  income  for all concerned.  Despite  the complex  genetics  
involved  in quantitative  traits like milk production,  it is relatively  simple  to 
decide  on an effective  breeding  strategy  once  there  is consensus  over  die trait  of 
choice.  Once  selection  for this trait is being  maximized,  the weights  in the RBI 
will play a bigger  role in determining  choice  of the most  profitable  bulls.  It is, 
therefore,  up to Irish producers  to decide  on their  priorities  and communicate  
them at the national  level.
Once goals have been defined,  the task of implementation  falls to the 
researchers.  Now that technology  is finally  catching  up with the needs  of the 
dairy industry,  the potential  for improvement  is phenomenal  in many areas.  
Implementation  of an Animal  Model  and availability  of more  meaningful  proofs  
from international  sources,  coupled  with a greater  understanding  of the genetic  
makeup  and an incorporation  of biotechnology  will increase  the role that a 
breeding  programme  can play in overall  dairy management.  Since it is the 
producers  which ultimately  benefits  from such research,  there is a need to 
increase  awareness  and effectiveness  through  some  of the ways  outlined  in this 
paper. Rather  than simply  follow  a dictated  policy,  industry  must begin to 
contribute  to it also.

Dairy  Herd  Fertility:  Update  and 
Technology  Developments
J. SREENAN  and M. DISKIN  
Teagasc,  Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam,  Co. Galway.
The theme  of most  agricultural  production  research  conferences  these  days  is 
efficiency  of output  rather  than  output  per se and this applies  equally  to the topic  
of herd fertility.  In the dairy  herd,  overall  reproductive  efficiency  determines,  to 
a greatextent,  the efficiency  of milk  production.  In Ireland  the national  dairy  herd 
is mostly  spring  calving  but, irrespective  of calving  date, a compact  calving  
pattern  is central  to the achievement  of efficiency.  Also, because  genetic  
improvement  is both cumulative  and permanent  a level  of A.l. usage  consistent  
with maximising  genetic  improvement  is also essential  to further  increase  
efficiency.
HERD  FERTILITY
Management  decisions  taken  not  only  during  the breeding  season  but through ­
out the year  have a  major  influence  on the success  of the breeding  programme.
Records
A good  recording  system  is an essential  part of a good  breeding  management  
programme.  Good  individual  records  are not  only  part  of good  farm  management  
practice  but their analysis  is also the first essential  step in any herd infertility  
investigation.  A comprehensive  analysis  of good breeding  records  will yield  
more  useful  quantitative  information,  to allow  identification  of the cause(s)  of 
infertility,  than can be frequently  ascertained  from blood,  feed,  herbage  or soil 
analyses.
Herd  reproductive  targets
Overall  reproductive  targets  for a dairy  herd are presented  in Table  1.
Table  1
Herd fertility  targets
* 90% cows calved  within  10 weeks
* < 5% culled  for “infertility ”
* 365 day calving  interval
When  these targets  are reached  other  measures  of reproductive  efficiency,  
such as submission  rate, conception  rate and calving-to-service  interval  are 
certain  to be optimal.
Most herds however,  do not achieve  these targets  and have both longer
149
calving  seasons  and higher  culling  rales.  Long  calving  seasons  result  in losses  of 
milk  and  calves  and also  in higher  cost  due to more  A.l.,  higher  replacement  rates  
and higher  cow  maintenance  costs.  Depending  on the milk  and  calf  prices  and  the 
cost  estimates  used, the loss per day per cow in the herd is about  £2.50  - 3.50  for 
every  day lost over a 365-day  calving  interval.
Reproductive  inefficiency  in the herd arises  mainly  from inefficiency  in 2 
areas,  viz., heat  detection  and conception  rate.  The  effect  of different  levels  of 
efficiency  of these  on the number  of days lost is shown  in Table  2.
Table  2
Effect  of different  levels  of heat detection  and conception  rate on days  lost

80% 70% 60% 50%
60% 0 6 11 18 27
C.R.%  50% 9 14 20 28 39
40% 20 25 34 49 59
A 90% heat detection  rate and a 60% conception  rate optimises  herd 
performance  and, as tne efficiency  of each of these falls, days are lost. A heat 
detection  rate of 60% and a conception  rate of 50%, levels which are not 
uncommon,  result  in a lost of 28 days,  which  at £3 per day per cow in the herd  
means  a loss of £4,200  in a 50 cow herd.
Heat  detection  efficiency
Heat detection  is a most time consuming  and repetitive  task of breeding  
management  when using A.l. and it demands  a very  high  commitment.  O’Farrell  
(1982)  has outlined  not only the significance  of, but also how  to achieve  a high 
submission  rate for insemination.  This  requires  frequentand  careful  checking  for 
heat, especially  in the early morning  and late evening.  This work has also 
described  the advantage  of using tail paint  to reduce  the burden  of heat  checking.
FACTORS  AFFECTING  CONCEPTION  RATE
Even when heat detection  and insemination  are properly  carried  out a 
significant  amount  of reproductive  wastage  still occurs.  Only about 55% of 
inseminations  result  in the birth  of a calf  at term  and we have  previously  mapped  
the extent  and timing  of this reproductive  wastage  (see Fig 1).
These  studies  have  shown  that conception  failure  is almost  synonymous  with 
embryo  death,  the extent  of which  can vary with a range  of factors,  the most  
important  of which  arc outlined.

DAYS  AFTER  INSEMINATION

cally  mean  accurate  heat  detection.  Not  only  is heat  detection  efficiency  on farms  
low but a significant  proportion  of the cows  presented  for A.l. are not in heat  and 
this presents  two problems.  Firstly,  if a cow is incorrectly  declared  in heat and 
is inseminated  the chances  of conception  are nil. These  cows will be seen to 
repeat  at short  and irregular  intervals.  Secondly,  if a cow that is already  pregnant  
is presented  for insemination  there  is a risk of inducing  death  of the developing  
embryo  or foetus.  The accuracy  of heat  detection  can be established  by examin ­
ing the pattern  of repeat  intervals  as is illustrated  in Table  3.

Inaccurate 18 26 14 19 23

Accurate  detection  will result  in about  60% of repeat  intervals  falling  within  
an interval  of 18-24  days  from  A.l. Patterns  that  deviate  from  this clearly  suggest  
either  sheer inaccuracy  or alternatively,  overcautious  heat detection.  A high 
proportion  of cows  repteating  at interv^s  of less than 18 days is indicative  of 
inaccurate  heat  detection  while  a high  proportion  repeating  at about  42 or 63 days  
indicates  overcautious  heat and/or  poor  heat detection  efficiency.
Calving-to-conception  interval
A major  factor  affecting  herd conception  rate is the length  of time cows  are 
calved  at insemination.  The  cow has only 80 days  after  calving  during  which  her 
uterus  must  return  to normal  (which  takes about  30 days),  her ocsirous  cycles
151
must resume,  she must be seen to stand in heat and she must have a fertile  
breeding.  Fertility  does  not return  to normal  until  about  60 days  after  calving  (see 
Table  4) and may even be longer  in high yielding  cows.  Therefore  the modem  
dairy  cow,  particularly  the high yielding  cow, is operating  near  the limit  of her 
biological  capacity  to reproduce  within  a 365-day  interval.

Late  calving  cows  are, of necessity,  frequently  inseminated  at their  first heat 
after  calving  when  conception  rate is often  as low as 20-30%.  In seasonal  calving  
herds,  late calving  cows usually  have a short calving-to-service  interval  and 
consequently  tend to require  more  services  to become  pregnant  that do earlier  
calving  herd  mates.  When the breeding  season  is short  (3 months)  many  of these  
cows  are not in-calf  when  breeding  ceases  and end up being  culled  for failure  to 
conceive.  Of 104 cows  culled  from the Belclare  dairy  herd  over  an 8-year  period  
for failure  to go in calf, 25% had only been given  one opportunity  and 60% of 
them  only  two  opportunities  to become  pregnant.  There  is evidence  that the same  
is happening  throughout  the dairy industry  with many  cows being  culling  for 
failure  to go in-calf  simply  reflecting  late  calving  and insufficient  time  to become  
pregnant  and not true infertility.
A compact  calving  pattern  is essential  if a high proportion  of the herd is to be 
inseminated  at an optimum  interval  after  calving.
A.l. timing  and technique
Provided  that the standard  recommendation  of inseminating  in the morning  
cows that were seen in heat the previous  evening,  and of inseminating  in the 
evening  cows that were seen in heat that morning,  is adhered  to, more exact  
timing  of insemination  is not critical.  An exception  to this, however,  would  be 
the use of semen  from bulls  of low fertility,  in which  case the optimum  time to 
inseminate  is 12-18  hours  after heat is first observed.
DIY A.l.
The site of semen  deposition  within  the reproductive  tract of the cow has a 
significant  effect  on conception  rate. Semen  should  be deposited  in the body  of 
the uterus. There  is no benefit  in going  further  to place  the semen  in each uterine  
horn. Attempts  to place the semen  in either  uterine  horn frequently  leads to 
damage  of the uterine  lining.  DIY operators  should  re-train  at the start of each 
breeding  season.
Energy  nutrition
The relationship  between  nutrition  and fertility  is complex  and direct  associa ­
152
tions  are almost  impossible  to detect.  However,  it is important  to understand  that, 
in general,  cows  can not eat enough  after  calving  to meet  the demands  of milk  
production.  Their  energy  output  is greater  than  their  intake,  which  means  they  are 
in negative  energy  balance  and will use their own body reserves  to meet the 
demand.  If the loss of body condition  is excessive  then cows take longer  to 
resume  cycles  and their conception  rate will be reduced.
Furthermore,  cows that are over-fat  at calving  experience  an even greater  
negative  energy  balance  because  they have a reduced  appetite.  Such cows  
rapidly  mobilise  fat which  accumulates  in the liver  and this fatty liver  syndrome  
isalso  associated  with  a delayed  return  to cyclicity  and  a reduced  conception  rate.
The best recommendations  are to have  cows  in a target  body condition  score  
of 2.5 to 3.0 at calving,  ensure  that feed  intake  is maximised  in early  lactation  and 
that cows  are in a body  condition  score  of 2.0-2.5  at breeding.
Protein  nutrition
Another  nutrition  situation  that has attracted  our attention  at Belclare  is the 
drop  in conception  rate frequently  seen after  spring  turnout.  The fall in concep ­
tion rate seems  to coincide  with peak grass  growth  and may be associated  with 
an excess  intake  of rumen-degradable  protein  which  is high in spring  grass.  Our 
current  research  programme  indicates  that this fall in conception  rate can be 
reversed  by supplementation  with a rumen  undegradable  protein  (see Table  5).

The possible  mechanism(s)  by which the protein  supplement  apparently  
reduces  the extent  of embryonic  loss is now being  examined.
Other  factors  that affect  conception  rate
Specific  dietary  factors  such as mineral  or trace element  deficiencies  or 
excesses  can also reduce  conception  rate but arc not considered  to be of major  
importance  and can be avoided  by good management  and proper  nu^ition.
There is a significant  amount  of investment  by farmers  on unnecessary  
mineral  and or trace  element  supplementation  as a possible  means  of correcting  
putative  infertility.  In most cases, however,  infertility  is due to management  
factors  other  than specific  dietary  deficiencies.
While  the extent  of bull infertility  has not been documented  in Ireland,  U.K.  
data  suggest  that 3-5%  of bulls  in natural  service  arc infertile  while  a further  30% 
arc, to some  degree,  subfcrtilc.  Also, it should  be rcali.scd  that a bull may not
153
remain  fertile  for his full working  life or indeed  for a full breeding  season.  
Natural  service  bulls  should  be observed  regularly  and mating  dates  recorded  in 
order  to identify  infertility  at the earliest  possible  time.
BREEDING  TECHNOLOGY  DEVELOPMENTS  
Apart  from  the benefits  arising  from genetic  improvement  schemes  through  
the use of A.l. many  dairy  farmers  are now  also using  cattle  breeding  technology  
such as synchronisation,  embryo  transfer  and ultrasound  pregnancy  testing  
either  to gain efficiency  or simply  as an aid to herd management.
PREGNANCY  TESTING
Failure  of a cow to be detected  in heat following  breeding  in most  instances  
means  pregnancy.  The proportion  of non-repeating  cows  actually  pregnant  will, 
however,  depend  on the efficiency  and accuracy  of heat  detection.  On the other  
hand, 5-10%  of pregnant  cows show heat and may abort if inseminated  or 
alternatively  such cows would  be inadvertently  diagnosed  non-pregnant  and 
culled  if heat activity  alone was the only method  of differentiating  between  
pregnant  and non-pregnant  cows.  About  10%  ofcows  culled  as barren  each  year 
are in fact pregnant.
Ideally,  cows  repeating  at an interval  of 2 months  or greater  from their last 
service  should  be checked  for pregnancy.
Positive  identification  of cows in calf is clearly  an essential  part of good  
breeding  management.  A number  of objective  pregnancy  tests are currently  
available  and are outlined  (see Table  6)
Rectal  palpation
This is the routine  method  of pregnancy  diagnosis  carried  out by veterinary  
practitioners.  From  about  Day  45 of gestation  the vet can,  through  the rectal  wall,  
detect  the difference  between  a pregnant  (enlarged)  and non-pregnant  uterine  
horn with a high degree  of accuracy  (>90%).  This test has greatest  application  
as a general  check  carried  out  at about  8 weeks  after  the end  of the breeding  period  
to avoid  the culling  of pregnant  cows.
Progesterone  test
The hormone  progesterone,  secreted  by the corpus  luteum,  is necessary  for 
the establishment  and maintenance  of pregnancy.  Three  weeks  after  breeding,  if 
fertilisation  and normal  embryonic  development  occurs,  the circulating  concen ­
tration  of progesterone  remains  high, indicating  a pregnancy.  In contrast  the 
concentration  in the non-pregnant  cow  declines  rapidly  from  about  18 days  after  
insemination.
Progesterone  level can be measured  in milk or blood. High progesterone  
levels at Day 21 or 22 indicate  pregnancy  with an accuracy  of about 80%,  
whereas  low levels  are indicative  of non-pregnancy  with an accuracy  close  to 
100%. The reduced  accuracy  of positive  pregnancy  diagnosis  arises from 
subsequent  embryonic  mortality.
154
Oestrone  sulphate  test
The concentration  of the hormone  oestrone  sulphate  is a highly  accurate  
indicator  of pregnancy  because  it is only produced  when  both the foetus  and 
placenta  are functioning  normally.  However,  it can only  be used  as an indicator  
of pregnancy  in cows  that  are bred  about  120 days  or longer.  Its accuracy  is close  
to 100%  and like palpation  it is most  relevant  as a general  herd test carried  out 
at about  8 weeks  after the end of the breeding  period  to avoid  the culling  of 
pregnant  cows.  Both progesterone  and oestrone  sulphate  tests are available  as 
kits.
Scanning
Scanning  or real-time  ultrasonography  is widely  used  to check  for pregnancy  
as early  as Day 15 in the mare.  Scanning  is also  an accurate  method  of pregnancy  
testing  in cows,  but only from about  Day 30-70  after breeding.  However,  the 
equipment  involved  is relatively  expensive  and sensitive  requiring  a reasonable  
level of ojjerator  skill,  which,  together  with the fact that its use is confined  to a 
relatively  short  period  are limitations  to its widespread  use for cows.

SYNCHRONISATION  OF THE  OESTROUS  OR HEAT  CYCLE  
Synchronised  breeding  in the dairy herd can, 1 ) reduce  the amount  of heat 
checking,  2) facilitate  A.l. and the use of genetically  superior  sires,  3) allow  A.l. 
at a fixed-time  and 4) induce  earlier  cycles  in late calving  cows.
Methods
Progestagens,  PRlDs  (Ceva  Ltd)  and CRESTAR  (Intervet  Ltd)  are commer ­
cially  available.  CRESTAR  is authorised  for dairy  heifers  but not yet for dairy  
cows in Ireland.  Prostaglandins,  Estrumate  (Pitman-Moore  Ltd.), Dinolytic  
(Upjohn  Ltd.) and Prosolvin  (Intervet  Ltd.) are commercially  available.  Only  
animals  between  Days  5-15 of the cycle  respond.  Two injections  at an interval  
of 10-12  days induces  most  animals  to respond  after the second  injection.
Heat  response
In cyclic  animals  PRlDS  and  CRESTAR  induce  a heat  response  of 85%-95%
155
with the majority  (80%)  in heat  between  24 and 60 hours  after  treatment.  About  
10% of animals  fail to synchronise  but come  in heat within  one week.
In cyclic  cows  and heifers  the double  prostaglandin  injection  induces  a heat 
response  of 80-90%,  with about  60% responding  between  48 and 72 hours  and 
a further  20% between  72 and 96 hours.
In non-cyclic  cows  use only progestagens.
Breeding
Fixed-time  A.l. at 48 and 72 hours  after  progestagen  removal  or one A.l. at 56 
hours  after a combined  progestagen-prostaglandin  treatment.  Calving  rates to 
fixed-time  A. I. are 45-60%  in heifers  and 35-60%  in cows.
Fixed-time  A.l. at 72 and 96 hours  after  2nd prostaglandin  injection.  Calving  
rates  are 45-60%  in heifers  and 35-60%  in cows.
Synchronisation  applications
The main applications  for the use of synchronised  breeding  are outlined.
Reduce  heat checking:  Synchronisation  allows  fixed-time  A.l. without  
reference  to heat. Most repeats  occur in a confined  period,  facilitating  heat 
checking.  Where  calving  is compact  about 70% of cows and all heifers  are 
available  at the start of the breeding  season.  A synchronised  and one repeat  
breeding  would  provide  adequate  replacements.
The greatest  potential  for synchronised  breeding  is in heifer  replacements,  
which  traditionally  are kept on an out-farm  and bred by natural  service.  If they 
have been produced  from  proven  bulls,  it is good  practice  to breed  them in turn 
to proven  dairy  bulls in a synchronised  programme.
Late calvers:  Treating  individual  late calving  cows with a progestagen  
(PRID)  can induce  earlier  cycles  and reduce  the calving-to-service  and concep ­
tion intervals.
Compact  calving:  Because  cows must  be calved  35-45  days before  treat­
ment,  depending  on the synchronisation  product,  the proportion  available  on a 
given  day is resuicted.  This  necessitates  treatment  of groups  of cows  at intervals.
Synchronisation  necessitates  assembly  of animals  up to four times,  viz., for 
progestagen  insertion  and removal  or for two prostaglandin  injections  and again  
for two fixed-time  inseminations.  This requires  good basic catUe handling  
facilities  and adequate  labour.  Synchronisation  is only successful  under  good  
management;  it m ust always  be used  as an aid to and never  as a substitute  for good  
breeding  management.
EMBRYO  TRANSFER  IN DAIRY  CATTLE  BREEDING
At the beginning  of each  oestrous  cycle  the cow sheds  a single  ovum.  Through  
supcrovulation  up to 20 ova can be shed which,  following  fertilisation,  are 
collected  as one week  old embryos  for direct  transfer  to recipient  heifers  or cows  
or for longterm  storage.
The combination  of single  calving  and a  gestation  length  of 9 months  results
156
in an  average  production  of five calves  per cow-lifetime  in Ireland.  This limits  
the cow ’s contribution  to genetic  improvement.  Embryo  transfer  allows  indi­
vidual  cows  to produce  several  calves  in one year  thereby  increasing  the cows ’ 
contribution  to genetic  improvement  For a commercial  dairy farmer  it poten ­
tially allows  the production  of replacements  from a smaller  number  of more  
select  cows. It is widely  used by pedigree  breeders  for the multiplication  of 
individual  cows  deemed  to be of high merit.
Over the past few years embryo  transfer  has developed  from a complex  
surgical,  to a relatively  simple  non-surgical  procedure  that can be carried  out on 
the farm.  Several  companies  and veterinary  practices  now offer  a commercial  
embryo  ffansfer  service.
The procedure  of in vitro fertilization,  or IVF,  has recently  opened  up a new 
source of high quality  but inexpensive  embryos  for commercial  use. Ova 
collected  from the ovaries  of slaughtered  heifers  are fertilized  in the laboratory  
using semen  from a range  of selected  continental  sires. It is now po.ssible  to 
transfer  such beef embryos  into that portion  of the dairy herd used for beef 
crossing  to produce  superior  beefeross  single  calves  or a proportion  of twins  if 
desired.
Role of embryo  transfer  in dairy  cattle  breeding
The greatest  role to-date  has been in a research  context,  and this will be even  
greater  in the future.  Commercial  application  of the technique  has so far been  
limited,  but the development  of non-surgical  procedures  for embryo  collection  
and transfer  and of efficient  freeze-storage  techniques  as outlined,  have  led to an 
expansion  in its use. The ability  to produce  continental-cross  beef  embryos  on 
a large-scale,  by IVF procedures,  means  there  is now potential  to significantly  
increase  the quality  of the beef  calf  crop.  The main  roles,  current  and potential,  
for embryo  transfer  in dairy  cattle  breeding  are outlined.
Accelerating  genetic  improvement:  In any cattle  breeding  programme  the 
rate of genetic  change  is a function  of (1) the accuracy  with which parents  of the 
next generation  can be selected,  (2) the intensity  of selection  and (3) the 
generation  interval.  With  the introduction  of artificial  insemination  and progeny  
testing,  cattle  breeding  programmes  can accurately  determine  the breeding  value  
of bulls.
Because  a bull can, through  semen  dilution,  storage,  and A.I., breed  up to 
50,000  cows in a year, few bulls are required  to breed  any cow population.  
Furthermore,  through  progeny  testing  it is possible  to reliably  establish  the 
breeding  value  of a bull for a range  of commercially  important  traits.  These  two 
factors  viz., the intensity  and accuracy  of selection  mean that most genetic  
progress  in a cattle  px)pulation  comes  from sire selection.  It is possible  tooperate  
a high level  of selection  intensity,  selecting  only  the top ranked  bulls.  Thus,  bulls  
in A.l. can be selected  accurately,  as well  as with  a high intensity,  and can then 
be widely  used within  the national  herd.
In conu-ast  on the female  side little  selection  is possible  because,  (a) each  cow 
normally  produces  only  one calf  per year  (b) 50%  of all calves  arc males  and, (c) 
about  20% of the herd will need to be replaced  each year. Until recently  the
157
genetic  merit  of the cow could  only be assessed  mainly  from her own perform ­
ance data and with relatively  low accuracy.  The introduction  of Cow Genetic  
Indices  (CGIs)  in 1989 for Pedigree  and Grading  up Friesians  now make it 
possible  to obtain  a better  estimate  of the genetic  merit  of  a cow  for fat and  protein  
production.  Increasing  the reproductive  rate through  embryo  transfer  allows  an 
increased  intensity  of selection  on the female  side which  gives  modest,  but in 
some  cases,  well worthwhile  gains.
Selection  of bull dams:  This has a direct  effect  on accelerating  the rate of 
genetic  progress  in a cattle  population  because  such  a bull dam,  will through her  
male  progeny,  affect  the genetic  merit  of thousands  of offspring.  Currently,  only 
about  25%  of the genetic  improvement  arises  from  selection  of bull dams,  while  
the remaining  75% comes  from progeny  testing  and selection  among  the bulls  
themselves.  The use of superovulation  and embryo  transfer  would  reduce  by 
50% the number  of bull dams  required  and by taking  care to minimise  the rate 
of inbreeding,  the proportion  of genetic  improvement  arising  from bull dam 
selection  could  be increased  from 25% to 30%. This would  result  in an overall  
improvement  in the rate of genetic  gain of the order  of 5%.
Most  of the young  bul Is now  entering  A.l.are  the result  of planned  mating,  and 
the use of superovulation  and embryo  transfer  increases  the likelihood  of getting  
a male  calf  from each cow selected  for such  planned  matings.
Selection  of dams to produce  female  replacements:  In a dairy cow 
population,  with a good breeding  programme,  the theoretical  annual  rate of 
genetic  gain could  reach  2% per annum.  However,  the realised  rate is probably  
less than 1% because  breeders  frequently  are attempting  to simultaneously  
improve  more than one trait. Of this gain, 90-95%  comes  from sire selection  
(including  selection  of their dams)  and the remaining  5-10%  from selection  of 
dams  ofcows.  Using  embryo  transfer  to increase  the selection  intensity  among  
females  would  increase  the female  contribution  towards  genetic  gain two-fold,  
from 5-10%  to 10-20%.  This represents  a relatively  small improvement  and 
probably  not worthwhile  considering  that other  options  exist  which  have  a more  
significant  impact  on the rate of genetic  gain. In addition,  exploiting  this aspiect  
of embryo  transfer  would  require  a very extensive  programme,  involving  most  
cows in the population  as donors  or recipients  which  is impractical.
Individual  breeders  are currently  using  embryo  transfer  for reasons  other  than 
solely genetic  gain. For example,  breeders  may be anxious  to multiply  a 
particular  line of cows within  a herd or to produce,  for sale, daughters  from 
particular  cows.
Quality  of beef calves  from the dairy herd: Recently,  there has been a 
significant  development  in the supply  and cost of production  of superior  beef-  
cross embryos.  The ability to retrieve  immature  ova from the ovaries  of 
slaughtered  animals  and to mature  and fertilize  these  in the laboratory  has added  
a new dimension  to cattle  embryo  transfer.  This procedure  of in vitro fertiliza ­
tion,  or IVF,  has opened  upa new  source  of high  quality  but inexpensive  embryos
158
for commercial  use. Three-quarter  continental  beef embryos  can now be pro­
duced  in large numbers  from the ovaries  of slaughtered  heifers.  The ova are 
fertilized  in the laboratory  using  semen  from  a range  of selected  continental  sires.  
Obvious  uses  for such  embryos  include  the production  of single  high  quality  beef 
calves  from dairy cows and also the induction  of twin-calving.  Where  twin ­
calving  is planned  it is important  that the 2 embryos  be of comparable  gestation  
length.
As an alternative  to A.l. a beef  embryo  could  be transferred  to a dairy  cow  one 
week  after heat. This would  allow  cows  not required  for breeding  replacement  
heifers  to produce  3/4 instead  of 1/2 continental  cross  calves.  Such  calves  would  
be expected  to produce  heavier  (-tlO  kg), leaner  carcases  of a higher  conforma ­
tion score  than Holstein  x continental  crosses.  However,  it should  be remem ­
bered  that  the incidence  of calving  difficulty  is likely  to be higher.  Because  of this 
only older  cows  with a previous  history  of easy calving  should  be used.
Twinning  in dairy cows: A series of Teagasc  experiments  showed  that 
lactation  yield  was not affected  in the lactations  either  concurrent  or subsequent  
to twin-calving  though  there  was evidence  that peak  yield  was lower  following  
twin-calving.  The interval  to resumption  of cyclicity  was similar  but the calving-  
to-conception  interval  was longer  in twin- than in single-calving  cows.  Twin-  
pregnant  dairy cows had an extra energy  requirement  of about 1500 MJ ME 
during  the last ttimester  of gestation.
The incidence  of retained  afterbirth  was.higher  for twin (about  30%) than  for 
single  (about  7%) calving  cows  and the incidence  of calf mortality  was some ­
what  higher  for twin  (16%)  than  for single  (10%)  calves.  While  the overall  level  
of calving  assistance  for single  and twin calving  cows was similar  the types  of
calving  difficulty  encountered  were  different.  Simultaneous  presentation  of both
calves  and/or  breach  presentation  of one calf were  the predominant  difficulties  
encountered  during  twin  calving  while  for single  calving,  large  calf  size was the 
predominant  problem.
Many  reports  clearly  show that naturally  occurring  twins  give rise to high 
rates of calving  difficulty,  calf mortality  and after-birth  retention  and longer  
calving-to-conception  intervals.  There was an indication  from the Teagasc  
studies  that subsequent  fertility  was reduced  in the twin-calving  dairy cows.  
Good  pre- and postpartum  nutrition  is critical  to minimise  adverse  effects  of 
induct  twinning  on calving-to-calving  interval.  However,  most  of the problems  
arise  because  the twin calvings  are unexpected.  A considerable  body  of data is 
now emerging  which  indicates  that such problems  can be avoided  by planned  
management,  particularly  in relation  to feeding.
