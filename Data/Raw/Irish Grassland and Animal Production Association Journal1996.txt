Purpose  of visit:
• To view good suckler  herd efficiency
• Excellent grassland management  
performance
• Suckler  cow housingand animal
Background
John Culbert  completed  his Green  Cert in 1995 and commenced  farming  
on a full time basis  with his parents.  At this time there were 10 Friesian 
suckling  cows multiple  suckling  30 calves  kept to beef at 3 years  of age, 
combined  with 20 ha of winter  and spring  cereals. Cattle  were self-fed  
and wintered  in cubicles  and on straw,  and home  grown  barley  was used 
for feed.
With the advent  of higher  calf prices  mainly  as a result  of the milk quota 
regime  the Culberts  reduced  the number  of suckler  cows  and moved  into 
store to beef production  for 2-3 years. In 1989 following  a number  of 
promotional  events  on suckling  organised  by Teagasc  in Laois  combined 
with higher  suckling  cow premia,  John and Edward  Culbert  commenced  
the purchase  of heifers  and putting  them in calf. The target  was to go 
to 50 cows by 1992 and finish all progeny.  Tillage  area has dropped  
from 20 ha in 1995 to zero in 1996. A suckler  cow quota of 45 was 
established  in 1992. All silage is harvested  with their own machinery.
Main farm objectives
1. To produce  beef and lamb more efficiently  through  optimum  use 
of grass and silage
2. To slaughter  steers  at 24 months  of age
3. To keep  production  costs down
4. To maximise  income  from subsidies  - REPS

Farm Size: 121 Ha (300 acres).
89 ha (220 acres)  of this farm were originally  owned  by the Blake  family  
who ran a very successful  private  racing  stables  during  the first half of 
this century.  They  trained  a number  of Derby  winners  plus other  classic 
winners  in Ireland  and England,
The farm is now a traditional  mixed  farm with 45 ha tillage,  228 cattle 
and 100 ewes. The tillage  area consists  of 32 ha of malting  barley  and 
seed all grown under contract,  8ha of sugar beet and 4 ha of fodder  
beet.
The sheep enterprise  of 100 ewes is an early lambing  flock, grass  
based,  the ewes lamb outside,  graze  silage  fields  until the end of March  
and then move  to the grazing  area. Lambs  are sold locally  and average  
number  of lambs  sold per ewe is 1.4.
The cattle enterprise  is based  on a 70 suckler  cow herd and 50 bought-  
in cattle, about 20 weanlings  and 30 bullocks.  Suckling  was practised 
on this farm during  the 1960's  and early 70's, phased  down during  the 
70's but never terminated.  In the late 70's and during the 80's the 
practice  was to buy cattle and finish them. Records  showed  that this 
business  was:
a) diminishing  in profitability
b) variable  in performance  from animal  to animal
c) time consuming,  hours in the mart for too few cattle
d) profit too dependant  on buying  price
e) unequal  competition  in the market  after 1987

Cows are housed in mid-December  and fed silage -t- pre-calving  
minerals. Calving  commences  in January  and finishes  in April. Cows 
and calves  go to grass in the first week of April and are weaned  in 
October. Calves are creep fed after weaning  and are housed in 
December.  Calves  are weaned  outside.
The weanlings  are fed silage + 2 kg meal in the shed. Calves  are 
treated  for worms  in June, August  and at housing. Ivomec  is used on 
this farm.
Yearlings  to grass in the first week of April. Heifers  are finished  on 
grass, receive  meals depending  on grass supply  from September  1, 
beginning  with 2 kg and increasing  to 4 kg. Finishing  weight  is 300 kg. 
We believe  that the finishing  of heifers  needs  further  research  due to the 
reduction  of the beef price.
Bullocks  are housed  in mid-October  and are fed silage,  5 kg of meal + 
12 kg fodder  beet. They are finished  in March and April. Average  
carcase  weight  in 1995 was 385 kg. This year the bullocks  will receive 
about  2 kg meals  for 3 weeks  before  housing.

1. INTRODUCTION
Grassland  is Ireland ’s greatest  renewable  feed resource  and it provides  the 
main  feed  for ruminant  livestock.  Over  90% of agricultural  land is under  grass ­
land (including  rough  grazing).  Grassland  (excluding  rough  grazing)  accounts  
for 4.3 X 10* hectares,  of which  30% is used for silage  and hay production  and 
the remaining  70% for grazing.  Grazed  grass,  followed  by conserved  grass,  are 
the cheapest  renewable  feeds  available  (Table  1). As the majority  of cattle  are 
Spring-born,  grazed  and conserved  grass are logically  the basis for efficient  
beef production  systems.  As a producer  of livestock,  over 80% of which  is 
exported,  Ireland  has few competitive  advantages,  but its ability  to grow  grass  
does offer  the chance  to provide  cattle  (and sheep)  with a relatively  cheap  feed 
source.  A national  balance  sheet by McLoughlin  (1991)  for the 6 year period  
1983/84  to 1988/89,  shows grazed  grass,  conserved  grass  and concentrates  con­
tributing  57%, 29% and 14% of dry matter  intake  for beef  cattle,  respectively,  
accounting  for 30%,  35% and 34% of the feed  costs  (Table  2). The feed cost  for 
some more intensive  beef systems  (Table  3) shows  the proportional  cost for 
grazed  grass  at 28%,  conserved  feeds  at 42% and concentrates  at 28%.

The key to efficient  beef  production  from grass,  now and in the future,  is to 
operate  a flexible,  adjustable  grassland  management  programme,  using  factual  
information  for prompt  and appropriate  decision-making  purposes.  The sys­
tem operated  must clearly  match  feed supply  to animal  requirements,  putting  
the major  emphasis  on increasing  the proportion  of cattle  diets that comes  from 
grazed  grass. The aim of this paper  is thus to describe  the technologies  by 
which  beef  can best be produced  from grazed  and conserved  grassland,  to re­
late these  to current  practices  and to identify  and quantify  the opportunities  for 
future  improvements.

2. CURRENT  PRACTICES  ON FARMS
a) Soil nutrient  status
Recent  soil analysis  results  (Gately,  1996) show that the average  lime re­
quirement  for soils is 6.2 tonnes/ha.  Farmers  who had  soils analysed  as part of 
the Rural Environment  Protection  Scheme  (REPS)  had an average  soil lime 
requirement  of 7 t/ha, compared  with 5.2 t/ha for other  farms. Soil P readings  
were 7 and 8.7 mg/1 and K readings  were 108 and 110 mg/1 for REPS  and non- 
REPS  sources,  respectively.
b) Sward  type
Most of the grassland  in Ireland  is old pasture. Based  on the quantities  of 
grass-seeds  sold, about 3% of the agricultural  land is reseeded  in any year.  
Much of the reseeding  is carried  out on land primarily  used for winter  feed 
production.  Cattle  thus tend to graze  old pasture  for most  of the season.
c) Management  standards
Using the 1994 Teagasc  National  Farm Survey (NFS) data, Hickey  
(1996;  Tables  4 to 8) described  the characteristics  of cattle-producing  farms,  
and showed  that beef  farmers  in general  use low inputs  of nitrogen  (<65 kg N/ 
ha/year)  and other nutrients  and operate  a relatively  low stocking  rate (1.36  
livestock  unit/ha).  He showed  considerable  scope  to improve  animal  produc ­
tivity and utilisation  of grassland.  Farm profile  data for more intensive,  spe­
cialised  suckler  farms  have been compiled  by Barlow  and Smyth  (1996)  using  
the 1994 Beefmis  survey  results  (Tables  9 and 10). These  farms,  operating  at 
an above  average  technical  efficiency,  had a stocking  rate of 2 livestock  units/  
hectare,  while  performance  at grass for weanlings  and older  progeny  was 1.1 
and 0.9 kg liveweight  gain per day, respectively.  Barlow  and Smyth  (1996)  
reported  an animal output  of 500 to 700 kg liveweight/ha,  which  is much  higher  
than the national  average  figure  of 350 kg (Hickey,  1996). Both  sources  of data 
show  that currently  average  costs of production  are distributed  equally  between  
fixed  and variable  costs.
d) Cost  of grass  production
Grass  growth  is affected  by a range  of factors,  some  of which  are outside  the 
control  of the farmer.  For example,  factors  such as weather,  geographical  loca­
tion and soil type have  a major  influence  on grass  growth  and consequently  on 
the cost of feeding  livestock.  Geographical  location  significantly  affects  the 
date of the start and end of the grazing  season  and Figure  1 shows  that the 
beginning  of the grazing  season  in the south  and south-west  is at least 3 weeks  
earlier  than  the north  and north-east.  A time difference  also exists  at the  end of 
the grass-growing  season,  where  the south  and south-west  again  have  up to a 3- 
week advantage.  The effects  of the above  factors  on the costs of producing  
grass are shown  in Table 11. For the same soil type and level of inputs,  the 
effect  of geographical  location  means  that grass yields  can range  from almost  
161 DM/ha  to less than 101 DM/ha  (Figure  2). Translated  into feed cost terms,  
the effect  of location  results  in costs ranging  from £37 to £52/t DMD  (digest ­
ible dry matter).  Weather,  which  can cause  considerable  variation  in year to 
year annual  grass production  (i.e. + or - 20% difference  from the long term 
average),  can alter production  costs from £42 to £63/t  DMD. Excess  soil wet­
ness can result in production  costs that range from £47 (dry) to £56 (wet)/t  
DMD.
The main factors  controlling  grass growth  which  are directly  influenced  by 
farming  practices  are soil fertility,  nitrogen  usage and grazing  management.  
Now  more  than ever, farmers  have to be cost conscious  and each input  has to be 
justified.  For grazed  grassland,  fertilisers  account  for 80% of the input costs  
associated  with  grass  production.  It is an essential  requirement  that each farmer  
knows  the soil nutrient  status  of their land. The decision  to apply  fertilisers  to 
grazing  grassland,  especially  phosphorus  (P) and potassium  (K), has to be made  
against  the background  of a knowledge  of soil nutrient  status.
Nitrogen  is the one major input at the farmers  disposal  which can be 
used to influence  grass  growth. The effect  of nitrogen  application  on grass

four years  of the study. Dry matter  yields  continued  to increase  up to an appli ­
cation  rate of 400 kg N/ha (360 units/ac).  However,  the grass yield response  
(%) in terms  of extra grass grown  for each 50 kg N applied/ha  (45 units/ac)  
declined  from 13% to 12%, 11%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 5%, 3% and 0% as the rate of 
nitrogen  increased  to 450 kg N/ha. Table 12 also shows  the cost of producing  
the extra  grass,  in terms  of £/tonne  DMD,  for each extra  50 kg N applied/ha.  An 
attractive  response  is achieved  with the lower levels of nitrogen  applied  
but grass production  costs increased  with each increment  of nitrogen  used.

Increasing  nitrogen  usage  from 300 to 350 kg N/ha (270 to 310 units/ac)  re­
sulted  in a yield  increase  of 5% and the cost  of the extra  grass  was  £121/t DMD.  
Grass costs of this magnitude  are very expensive  and alternative  purchased  
feeds  could  be economically  more  attractive.
3. CURRENT  RESEARCH  STANDARDS
a) Chronology  of recent  advances
In reflecting  the national  importance  of the contribution  of the suckler  herd 
and the progeny  from the  dairy  herd to the Irish beef  industry,  Grange  Research  
Centre  has for a considerable  number  of years being  researching  systems  of 
producing  beef  from  these  sources.  Both  systems  take  calves  from  birth  through  
to slaughter,  in most  cases  at 20 months  (heifers)  or 23 to 26 months  (steers)  of 
age. Table  13 shows  the progression  of advancements  in these  systems  over  the 
past 15 years, and suggests  likely output  for the near future  through  further  
improved  technologies  (including  grassland  management).  It is clear  that through  
technological  improvements  both  systems  have  been steadily  increasing  output  
and efficiency.  Present  outputs  are 730 and 500  kg carcass/hectare  for the Dairy  
Calf-to-Beef  and Suckler  Calf to Beef systems,  respectively.  These  outputs  
contrast  sharply with  those  reported  on commercial  farms (Teagasc  NFS, Hickey 
1996;  Barlow  and Smyth,  1996).
b) Current  Grange  systems  
(i) Suckler  Calf  to Beef  System
The present  system  (Drennan,  1993),  based  on early-March  calving,  finishes  
animals  at 20 (heifers)  and 24 (steers)  month  of age. The system  is stocked  at 
0.84 ha per cow unit (cow + calf + year old + replacements),  has a carcass  
output  of 500 kg per hectare  per year. This target  is achieved  by producing  a 
steer carcass  weight  of 400 kg, heifer  carcase  weight  of 300 kg and cull cow 
carcase  weight  of 400 kg. The target  output (carcass/ha)  is achieved  from 10

age production  is based  on 230 kg N/ha,  and silage  being  harvested  from 55% 
of the farm in late-May,  and 35% of the farm  area in late July. Silage  harvested  
in May is fed to the progeny,  while  the July-conserved  swards  are offered  to the 
cows. Cows  and calves  graze  separately  from  the older  cattle. Rotational  graz­
ing, with 10-12  paddocks  per animal  group,  is practised.  The grazing  season 
starts  in mid-April,  and silage  areas  are not  currently  grazed  early  in the season.  
Calves  are weaned  in mid-October  and housed  shortly  afterwards,  while  cows  
typically  remain  outdoors  at pasture  until late-November.  Steers  are housed  in 
mid-October  while heifers  are housed  in September  and finished  by mid-  
December.  Variable  costs  for the system  are 92-94  p, while  fixed  costs are 170- 
180 p/kg carcass.
For the Suckler  Calf-to-Beef  sytem.  Table  14 shows  the liveweights  achieved  
and the proportions  derived  from grazed  grass,  forage  and concentrates.  Two- 
thirdS  of the lifetime  gain for the progeny  from the suckler  system  is produced  
during  the grazing  season.  The liveweight  gain during  the first grazing  season  
amounts  to 220 kg (females)  and 250 kg (males)  or almost  60%  of the animals  
lifetime  gain. The indoor  winter  period  accounts  for one-third  of the lifetime  
weight  gains. The proportion  of gain achieved  by heifers  is small  in the second  
winter  as animals  are slaughtered  early  (at 20 months  of age). However,  almost  
half of the indoor  liveweight  gains are achieved  through  concentrate  feeding.  
All of the liveweight  gain achieved  on the cows  is derived  from grazed  grass.

24 months  later. Both  Friesian  and Friesian/Charolais  crosses  are used. Calves  
are reared  indoors  for the first 10 to 12 weeks  and go to grass in early May.  
Prior  to 1995,  yearlings  were  turned out to grass  in mid-April  and did not graze  
the areas designated  for silage.  However,  this has now changed,  with silage-  
ground  being  grazed  in early Spring. Sixty percent  of the farm area is cut for 
silage  in late May, with a further  40% cut in late July. Animals  are stocked  at 
0.45 ha/animal  unit (yearling  plus calf). Herbage  production  is about 10 tonnes  
DM/ha  and together  with  a concentrate  input  of 2.2 tonnes/ha,  produces  750 kg 
carcass  per hectare.  The concentrate  input  at 1 tonne  per animal  is made  up by 
feeding  100 kg at the calf  stage  (including  some  at grass  in the autumn),  150 kg 
during  the first winter  and the remainder  during  the second  winter.  A rotational  
grazing  system  involving  6 paddocks  up to June and 8 paddocks  at the end of 
the year has been practised.  Cost of production  are estimated  to be £2.04/kg  
carcass.  The main components  of this cost are, 84p for the calf  purchase,  9Ip 
for variable  costs and 29 p for fixed  costs.
11
In the Dairy  Calf  to Beef  System  (Table  15), lifetime  weight  increases  of 565 
and 630 kg per head are achieved  for Charolais  x Friesian  and Friesian  steers,  
respectively.  Fifty to 55% of the gain is achieved  at pasture  and a further  25% 
is achieved  from  forage  indoors. A  greater  proportion  (55%)  of the weight  gain  
is achieved  during  the second  year at pasture  when  compared  with the Suckler  
Calf to Beef  System.  Weight  gains during  the final winter  are almost  double  
those  achieved  during  the first winter.
One of the main features  of both Calf to Beef  Systems  is the high stocking  
rate achieved  in the early part of the season  (Table  16). Both systems  reach  a 
peak in early June of 3000 kg liveweight/ha  and this nevertheless  results  in 
high animal  gains  and provides  sufficient  areas  to be  conserved  for winter  feed. 
The long-term  future  of beef  production  systems  in Ireland  will depend  on inte­
grated  Calf-to-Beef  systems  with a major  proportion  of the lifetime  liveweight  
gain being  derived  from grazed  grass.
c) Grazing  management  strategies
(i) General  principle
The objectives  of grazing  management  are to produce  high yields  of quality  
grass  over a long grazing  season  and to manage  both the cattle  and grass  so as 
to utilise  the sward  as efficiently  as possible  while getting  high  levels  of animal  
intake  and thus achieve  high levels  of animal  output.
(ii) Producing  grass
As stated  earlier,  grass  production  is affected  by many  factors,  some  outside  
the farmers  control  (location  altitude,  aspect  etc.) and others  which  are directly  
affected  by farm management  decisions.
Soil nutrition  Getting  the basic  soil nutrition  such as lime, phosphorus  and 
potassium  corrected  are key factors  in grass production.  The minimum  that 
needs  to be known  is
a) soil pH, which  gives  a measure  of soil acidity  and the soil lime requirement,
and
b) phosphorus  (P) and potassium  (K) status
A knowledge  of potential  trace element  problems  is highly  desirable.  In 
terms-of  lime application,  its relationship  with  overall  soil fertility,  grass  growth  
and animal  production  are of the greatest  importance.  With very few excep ­
tions, liming  of grassland  to raise the soil pH to at least 6.0 is nearly  always  
justified.  The effects  of lime on improved  nutrient  availability,  increased  pro­
portions  of more desirable  grasses  in the sward,  a better  response  to applied  
fertilisers,  especially  nitrogen,  and thus to an overall  improvement  in animal  
output  is well documented  and accepted.  An example  of the beneficial  effect  of 
lime application  over the subsequent  four years is shown  in Table 17. More  
grass  was produced  (+28%)  and more  animals  (-1-47%)  were  carried  as a result  
of lime application.  The net effect  of applying  lime was to get an extra grass  
production  response  each year equivalent  to 75 kg N/ha (60 units/ac).

Annual  dressings  of phosphorus  and potassium  to grazed  grasslands  are some ­
times neglected.  Application  rates must be related  to stocking  rates  and soil 
test results.  Little  loss in production  on grazing  land will be seen by omitting  
one year ’s application  of phosphorus  or potassium.  However,  long-term  stud­
ies at Johnstown  Castle  and Grange  have shown  that annual  applications  of 15 
or 30 kg P/ha  (12 to 24 units/ac)  compared  with no phosphorus  were associated  
with 15 to 25%  extra  liveweight  gain per year. Thus,  an annual  application  of 
15 kg P/ha (13 units/ac)  is recommended  to maintain  soil P levels  on grazed  
grassland.  Animal  production  responses  to applications  of potassium  (K) are

small under  grazing,  but its role in conservation  is of great importance.  For 
grazing  an annual  application  of 30 kg K/ha  (27 units/ac)  will supply  sufficient  
potassium  for grass  growth.
Numerous  studies  have been conducted  to look at the relationships  between  
nitrogen  usage  and animal  output.  Figure  3 summarises  the results  of a 4 year 
experiment  outlining  the outputs,  measured  as liveweight  gain/hectare,  in re­
sponse  to increasing  levels  of nitrogen  (Brown  and Walsh,  1966). Both old 
pasture  and reseeds  were  compared.  With  old pasture,  an increase  in liveweight  
was obtained  through  the use of 200 kg N/ha/year  (180 units/acre).  However,  
with new swards,  output  continued  to increase  in response  to well over 300 kg 
N/ha (270 units/acre),  although  at a slower  rate. Data  from the National  Farm  
Survey  (1994)  shows  the average  nitrogen  input  on drystock  farms  to be less 
than 65 kg N/ha (55 units/acre).  The output  potential  of these farms could  
readily  be increased  by 33% in response  to additional  nitrogen  (if livestock  
were  available).  While  national  quotas  have placed  restrictions  on the number  
of cattle  for which  premia  payments  are attainable,  in the longer  term Ireland ’s 
ability  to cash-in  on a natural  competitive  advantage  depends  on our ability  to 
produce  high yields  of grass and efficiently  convert  them to beef. While  most  
farms  have the capacity  to expand  livestock  numbers,  any expansion  must be 
done  with careful  management  of costs.
Sward  type Sward  type has a major  influence  on output  of herbage  and 
animal  output,  and  for the foreseeable  future  swards  based  on perennial  ryegrass  
seem  to be the obvious  preferred  choice  of sward. With  current  plant  breeding  
approaches,  the present  rate of advancement  in dry matter  yield increase  is 
likely  to remain  at 0.5 to 1 % per year, unless  new biotechnological  advances  
take place.
Management  Management,  involving  timeliness  of operations  and a knowl ­
edge of plant response  to varying  fertiliser  application  rates and dates, will 
remain  critical  to producing  high yields  of grass.
(iii) Utilising  grass
Grass  utilisation  is discussed  below. The main emphasis  is on:
• knowing  (measuring)  grass  supply
• knowing  animal  feed requirements  (kg DM/head/day)
• matching  supply  and requirements.  This will be achieved  through
- rotational  paddock  grazing  system
- moving  cattle  when  swards  have  been tightly  grazed  (target  height,  herb ­
age mass)
- knowing,  identifying  and storing  surplus  grass
- re-introducing  the stored  surplus  at times  of deficit  or, if necessary,  sup­
plementing  with other  feeds
Successful  beef production  from grazed  grassland  depends  on having  a 
PLANNED  MANAGEMENT  SYSTEM  which  allows  for FLEXIBILITY  
as conditions  change.  As grazed  grass is the main feed component,  a knowl ­
edge  of its growth  pattern  and stock-carrying  capacity  is important.  Grass  growth  
is seasonal  and can change  widely  over  short  periods  of time. The rate of grass

1993/94/95/96
growth  for Grange  Research  Centre,  expressed  in kg DM/ha/day  is shown  in 
Figure  4. One general  trend is evident  and that is that once mid-April is reached,  
grass growth  increases  rapidly,  and during  May values  of 100 kg DM/ha/day  
are common.  At that level  of growth  each hectare  is capable  of supporting  up to 
5 livestock  units (2 LU/ac)  assuming  that each LU is offered  20 kg DM/day. 
Once mid-June  has passed  there is an inevitable  decrease  in grass growth,  so 
that by mid-August  pastures  will only support  half of the May stocking  rate. 
There  is nevertheless  big variation  between  years. Thus, for example,  grass  
growth  during  early April 1994 and 1996 was 10 kg DM/ha/day  or less com­
pared  with 20 to 30 kg DM/ha/day  in 1993 and 1995. During  1994,  over a 3- 
week  period  in late-April  to mid-May,  grass  growth  increased  10-fold  from 12 
to 120 kg DM/ha/day,  but then proceeded  to 40 kg DM/ha/day  during  the fol­
lowing  four weeks.  It then increased  to 80 kg DM/ha/day  within  the next 3- 
weeks  and finally  decreased  steadily  over the remainder  of the season.  Similar  
fluctuations  are evident  most  years. To fully exploit  this changing  grass  supply, 
a flexible  management  system  is required.  A system  that allows  the farmer  to 
see up-coming  shortages  as well as short-term  surpluses  needs  to be practised  if
16
grass  is to be utilised  efficiently  and economically.  A rotational  grazing  system  
offers  the flexibility  necessary  to make  these  management  decisions.  As most  
farms  are composed  of a number  of fields,  which  vary in size, the introduction  
of a rotational  grazing  system  is not necessarily  too difficult.  Subdivisions  do 
not need to be  of equal  sizes. The greater  the number  of fields  or paddocks  that 
are available,  the greater  is the flexibility  introduced  into the grassland  man­
agement  process.  While  keeping  control  on costs,  a target  of 10-12  paddocks  
(not necessarily  of equal size) in the Spring-Summer  period  offers  sufficient  
flexibility  to manage  grass  in a variable  supply  situation.
The aim of each  cattle  farmer  must  be to maximise  the intake  of grazed  grass  
by cattle  in an efficient  manner  and to get maximum  animal  gains  over as long 
a grazing  season  as possible.  For efficient  beef production  from grassland,  a 
balance  is needed  between  the ability  of grassland  to support  stock  during  the 
grazing  season  and the provision  of adequate  Winter  feed. Inadequate  Winter  
feed, especially  in terms  of quality, is still a  serious  limitation  on many  drystock  
farms. Inadequate  stocks  of winter  feed means  prolonged  winter  grazing,  with 
little liveweight  gains (indeed  weight  losses will occur)  and damage  to pas­
tures. Late closing  of swards  as a result  of uncontrolled  grazing  in Autumn/  
Winter  means  delayed  Spring  grass growth,  so that when stock  are turned-out  
early,  through  necessity  as a result  of Winter  feed shortage,  performance  is poor  
and pasture  production  suffers  as a result  of over grazing.  Early turnout  to an 
adequate  supply of Spring  grass  is highly  desirable,  firstly, in terms  of improved  
animal  gains,  secondly  to achieve  a long grazing  season  and thirdly  to reduce  
costs associated  with the more  expensive  Winter  period.
Knowing  grass  supply A knowledge  of grass  supply  at all times  of the year  
is essential  if informed  management  decisions  are to be made. While  issues  
such as rotation  length  and rest interval  are of great importance  to planned  
grassland  management,  a knowledge  of pasture  supply  or pasture  cover  on a 
weekly  basis (if not daily)  is essential  if the best use is to be made  of grass.
All grassland  farmers  should  have the  skills  to quantify  pasture  sward  height  
and pasture  yields  (sometimes  referred  to as pasture  cover). Tables  which  re­
late sward  height  (compressed  heights)  to yield  have been produced  at Grange.  
As a simple  guide,  each centimeter  of compressed  grass  above  4 cm of stubble  
contains  approximately  150 kg DM/ha.  The use of sward  height  for grassland  
measurements  are more fully discussed  in the attached  Appendix.  An assess ­
ment  of pasture  cover  may be obtained  by frequently  (once  per week)  walking  
the entire  grazing  area and measuring  sward  height. The measurement  can be 
made with  a sward  stick,  ruler  or place  meter. Eye assessment  can also be used 
to estimate  pasture  availability.  Once  the technique  of pasture  cover  measure ­
ment  is mastered,  it is surprising  how quickly  small  changes  in pasture  supply  
will be detected.  An example  of pasture  cover  (Figure  5 & 6) on the Grange  
Dairy  Calf to Beef  System  for 1996 (to date) is shown. At turnout,  a pasture  
cover  of 5(X) kg DM/ha  was present  over the grazing  area (40%  of farm). This 
increased  to a peak  of 1500  kg DM/ha  in early  June when  surplus  grass  (20% of 
area) was removed  and a cover  of 800 to 1000 kg was maintained  until early  
August  when  silage  aftermath  became  available.

Start  of spring  grazing/autumn  closing  dates Late closing  of swards  as a 
result  of prolonged  uncontrolled  grazing in Autumn/early  Winter  has a negative  
effect  on Spring  grass  supply. Table 18 shows  that when  swards  are closed  in 
mid-October  compared  with  mid-December,  yields  in mid-March  and early  April  
were 78% higher  following  the earlier  closing  date. Yields  from  mid-Novem ­
ber closing  date were intermediate.  Apart  from less grass in Spring,  there is a 
total loss to the system  because  the amount  of grass  grazed  in the Autumn  as a

result  of the delay  in closing  is less than the difference  between  the two Spring  
yields. It should  be the aim of all livestock  farmers  to have some  of the farm  
closed  or rested  from mid-October  onwards  to provide  early Spring  grass. A 
rotational  grazing  system  facilitates  an orderly  closing  of pastures  in Autumn.
The importance  of adequate  Spring  grass supply  and of its effect  on beef 
output  is shown  in Table 19. With an inadequate  supply  of grass on April 1, 
animal output  was 17% poorer  than when  grazing  started  one week  later,  which

in turn was inferior  to starting  grazing  on April 15. Delaying  the start of 
grazing  until April  22 reduced  total production  for the year because  the excess  
supply  resulted  in stemmy  pastures  of lower  quality.  Alternatively,  the earliest  
grazing  date resulted  in inadequate  grass supply  and not only reduced  animal  
performance  but also resulted  in the need for an earlier  reduction  in stocking  
rate in mid-summer.  Consequently,  when  pastures  have  a herbage  mass  (yield)  
of approximately  1000  kg DM/ha  (in the grazing  horizon)  or a sward  height  of 
approximately  8 cm (compressed  sward  height), pasture  supply  should,  in most  
years,  be sufficient  to support  the full livestock  grazing  requirements  on the 
grazing  areas.

Any grazing  of silage  swards  in Spring  will reduce  silage  yields. However, 
provided  that the final grazing  is done before  April 10, a reduction  in silage  
yield  of not greater  than 15% can be expected.  When  the amounts  of herbage  
consumed  by the animals  is allowed  for, the net quality  effect  of Spring  grazing  
of silage  swards  is likely  to be less than 5%. Thus,  grazed  grass  has replaced  a 
more  expensive  winter  feed (but  the remaining  winter  feed may be more  expen ­
sive). Recent  Grange  results  (O’Riordan,  1996)  have shown  that in a planned  
grazing  system,  up to 3 weeks  grazing  can be obtained  on silage  swards  in 
Spring. The earlier  the sward  is closed  after grazing  the smaller  is the silage  
yield reduction.  All silage  swards  should  be closed  by April 10 at the latest.  
Better  animal  performance  has been achieved  through  this early turnout  and a 
net extra 10 to 15 kg liveweight  gain  per head has been measured  at Grange  as 
a consequence  of going  to grass early. In this situation,  herbage  mass  (yield) on 
the silage  swards  was only 500-750  kg DM/ha  in the grazing  horizon  (above 4 
cm). Furthermore,  a rotational  grazing  of silage  swards,  where  paddocks  are 
grazed  only once,  results  in a series  of Spring  closing  dates and thus a smaller  
yield  reduction.  At a pasture  supply of 1000  kg DM/ha  or greater  in early  April,  
silage  swards  do not need to be grazed  because  there is sufficient  DM on the 
grazing  land to carry the cattle.
Controlled  grazing  in Spring The ability  of well-managed  grass  swards  to 
produce  high yields  of herbage  and liveweight  in April/June  is underestimated  
by most livestock  farmers.  It is the stage where  the greatest  wastage  of valu­
able feed  takes  place  on farms. Grass  growth  rates vary  considerably  from  year 
to year and location  to location,  but over half of the annual  grass yield is pro­
duced  in the April/June  period.  In most cases,  this high yield of high quality  
herbage  is not managed  correctly  and its true feeding  value is not well used. 
The failure  to adequately  convert  this valuable  feed resource  has a number  of 
consequences.  Firstly,  while  satisfactory  animal  gains  are achieved  in the short  
term (April/May),  the performance  for the subsequent  months  suffers  as stock  
are grazing  poor quality,  stemmy,  rejected  herbage.  Animals  do not need to 
have huge masses of herbage  (greater  than 3000 kg DM/ha)  in order  to give 
satisfactory  performance.  Secondly,  because  of under-utilisation, which in some  
situations  is less than 50%,  pasture  output  is depressed  for the remainder  of the 
season.  Thirdly,  pasture  quality  is poor  and swards  which had  a DMD  value of 
750 g/kg in mid-May  (capable  of producing  a liveweight  gain of 1 kg or greater/  
head/day)  drops  to around  650 g/kg DMD  in June and July with the result  that 
animal  weight  gains  suffer. Fourthly,  as pasture  growth  rates fall off, animals  
will be forced  to eat into a stubble  of very low quality  with the result  that gains  
in mid to late season  will be poor, a phenomenon  seen on many farms. This 
cycle of surplus  grass growth  early in the season  and the inability  to subse ­
quently  capture  it in an efficient  manner  is repeated  yearly  on many  farms.
Recent  Grange  research  has shown  that high stocking  rates in Spring  can be 
associated  with high levels  of animal  performance  both in the short and long 
term. Data in Table  20 show that over a 3 year period  high performance  was 
achieved  over  an extended  period of time. On swards  receiving  200 kg N/ha,  a 
daily liveweight  gain of over 1.1 kg was achieved  from early April until mid-
20

August  on swards  stocked  at 3000  kg liveweight/hectare  at turnout.  The graz­
ing pressure  had increased  to 4000  kg liveweight/hectare  in mid August  before  
a stocking  rate reduction  took place. Similarly,  clover-based  swards  receiving  
only 50 kg N/ha  in February,  and stocked  at 2500 kg liveweight/ha  at turnout,  
were able to achieve  weight  gains of over 1.1 kg/day  during  the period  from  
early  April until mid August.  These  latter swards  were supporting  a stocking  
rate of 3000 kg/ha  in mid August.  These  animal  performances  at grass were  
achieved  with animals  weighing  550 kg in April,  and that had gained  0.9 kg/ 
day during  the previous  winter. As well as achieving  these levels  of animal  
gain at high stocking  rates,  the use of flexible  grassland  management  allowed  
up to 25% of the grazing  area be removed  as surplus  grass  for ensiling.  These  
high daily gains and stocking  rates are achieved  on the basis that most of the 
seasons  growth  (60%)  takes  place  in April/June  (Table  21) and that the feeding  
quality  is high (750  g.^kg  DMD)  if well managed.  In Table  20, increasing  stock ­
ing rate from  2000  to 3000  kg liveweight/ha,  thereby  releasing  50% of the land 
area, only depressed  daily gain by 10%. In terms  of response  to applied  ferti­
liser  nitrogen,  the best response  is achieved  during  the months  of April/June.  It 
is then clear  that most  of the winter  feed  requirements  should  be obtained  early  
in the season  (May/June).  Trying  to achieve  a large proportion  of the winter  
feed requirement  after mid summer  is most likely  to be unsuccessful.
Guidelines  for grazing  swards  in Spring  should  centre  on a rest interval  of 
not greater  than 24 to 26 days. Rest intervals  greater  than these,  while  growing  
more  grass,  will lead to  poor  pasture  utilisation  and thus lead to  swards  of lower  
quality  later in the season. Data from Grange  show that grazing  to a stubble  
height  of 5 to 5.5 cm (compressed  sward  height)  or a residual  mass of 500 to 
600 kg DM/ha  during  April  to July, resulted  in gains  of over 1.1 kg liveweight/  
head/day.
With proper  grassland  management,  animals  can achieve  a steady rate of 
gain over a long grazing  season. Recent  Grange  data (Figures  7 and 8) shows

that where  pasture  quality  is maintained  and when herbage  supply  and herd 
demand  are matched,  animals  can grow at a steady  rate from  April  through  to 
November.  Similarly,  where  overstocking  took place  in Autumn,  performance  
was poor. Most  pastures  will only support  1200  to 1400  kg liveweight/ha  from  
October  onwards  and for higher  stocking  rates a carryover  of pasture  from  ear­
lier in the season  (August/September)  is necessary.  A rotational  grazing  system  
makes  this approach  more practical.  The demand  and supply  of grass on the 
Grange  Suckler  and Dairy  Calf to Beef  Systems  are shown  in Figure  9. The 
data shows  grass growth  rates and herd demand  per hectare  on a daily basis.  
Once grass growth  starts to increase,  grass supply  exceeds  demand  for mid 
April onwards  until late August,  at which  time all of the farm is needed  to 
supply  the herd demand.  With,  for example,  a demand  for grass  of 20 kg DM/  
ha/day  on the full farm  or 50 kg DM/ha/day  on 40% of the area a yield  of 1000  
kg DM at turnout  has sufficient  grass  for 20 days. For suckler  cows  before  the 
end of the first grazing  cycle,  all animals  will be at pasture  (all cows calved)  
and the herd daily requirement  is increased  from 50 to 75 kg DM/day.  With  
1000 kg DM/ha  on offer, there are only 13 to 14 days feed available.  Grass  
growth  rates will increase  each day and will exceed  75 kg DM/ha/day  before  
the end of the first grazing  cycle  resulting  in grass supplies  building  up.
Transferring  grass from times  of surplus  to times  of scarcity  has been much  
discussed  in recent  years. There  is surprisingly  little scientific  data relating  to 
the practice  of what has become  known  as extended  grazing.  Grange  results  
over  the past 3 years  have  shown  that the grass,  if available,  can be carried  as a 
standing  crop in Autumn  for 6 weeks  or more with no advantage  of a longer  
rotation,  even though  pasture  quality  (DMD)  is maintained  for periods  of 9 to 
10 weeks. However,  Figure  9, shows  that from September  onwards,  herd de-

mand  matches  supply,  so that carrying  feed supply  for 6 weeks  into October  or 
November  is unlikely  to take place  as there  is not sufficient  grass  to do so. As 
provision  of sufficient  winter  feed is a key issue  in attaining  high stocking  rates,  
and conserving  35 to 40% of the farm in late July is an integral  part of the 
management  programme,  the scope  for surplus  grass  in the absence  of omitting  
some  second  cut areas  seems  limited.  However,  on farms  where  most  or all of 
the Winter  feed comes  from  a single  May/June  harvest,  the chances  of carrying  
feed from  August/September  should  be an option,  but have  yet to be assessed.
d) Forage  for Winter  feeding
Provision  of adequate  winter  feed is a key to efficient,  high levels  of animal  
output.  Silage  quality  is of major  importance  where  farmers  want  high rates  of 
animal production  from  silage-fed  cattle. Consistently  achieving  well preserved  
silage  of high digestibility  (DMD)  is difficult  but attainable.  Weather  patterns,  
both  directly  and indirectly,  impact  in a very major  way on  the yield,  dry matter  
concentration,  digestibility,  preservation  and unit cost  of silage. Consequently,  
there  is a clear  limit  on the extent  of the control  that can be exercised  over the 
weather-induced  variability,  and the flexibility  of reducing  variation  will there ­
fore depend  on the ability  to react or respond  quickly  and with flexibility  to 
particular  circumstances  that arise due to weather.  This ability  to respond  is 
often difficult  to achieve,  especially  if it is remembered  over 80% of silage  is 
harvested  by contractors.
(i) Silage  yield
The following  factors  are important  in reducing  variability  in silage  yield:
• Perennial  ryegrass  swards  can be  managed  to produce  more  consistent  yields  
than other grasses.  Mid and late season  cultivars  will give less variable  
second  cuts than early  cultivars.
• To assist  achieving  consistent  yields,  soil analysis  each 5 years should  be 
used to determine  the P, K and lime status  of the silage  fields. Appropriate  
fertiliser  inputs  should  be based on these results,  together  with replacing  
what the crop removed  and what was supplied  by slurry. Maintenance  of 
high fertility  is important  as it leads  to less fluctuation  in yield from  year to 
year.
• Nitrogen  fertiliser  should  be applied  as early as possible,  ground  conditions  
and weather  permitting.  In many  cases  where  silage  ground  is not grazed  in 
Spring,  N can be applied  in early March.  In all cases,  at least  6 weeks  should  
elapse  between  spreading  N and harvesting.  On many  lighter  soils,  sulphur  
should  be applied  for second-cut  silage.
• Slurry  spreading  should  be completed  by mid March  for first cut silage  and 
should  not be applied  to high grass. It should  only  be applied  to bare stubble  
for regrowths  (rates  dealt with later).
• Assuming  that soil fertility,  structure  drainage  and nutrient  supply  are satis­
factory,  the yield  of a particular  sward  is substantially  dependent  on weather. 
At that stage,  the main mechanism  for achieving  a given  yield is by altering  
the harvesting  date. However,  delaying  harvesting  date to increase  yield is
24
normally  accompanied  by a decrease  in digestibility.  The correct  balance  
between  yield  and quality  will depend,  among  other  factors,  on the type and 
intensity  of enterprise  on the farm and the relative  costs of forage,  concen ­
trates  and animal  product.  However,  relative  variability  in dry matter  yield  
can often be reduced  by harvesting  the first-cut  in the final week of May 
rather  than in mid May. Variable  yields  usually  occur  in July/August  har­
vests,  and on farms  that are prone  to severe  drought  this may be an insur ­
mountable  problem.
• Grass  dry matter  concentrations  at harvesting  impact  on the fresh  yields,  as 
well as on effluent  losses  and the ease of preservation.  The progression  in 
grass dry matter  concentration  from 200 g DM/kg  to 180, 150 and 120 g 
DM/kg  reflects  the effects  of dew, a heavy  rain shower  and several  days 
rain, respectively,  and would  increase  the fresh yield at a 25 t/ha crop to 28, 
33 and 42 t/ha, respectively.
(ii) Digestibility
As silage  digestibility  increases  cattle  eat more  of it, utilise  it more  efficiently  
and produce  correspondingly  more meat or milk. Farmers  who want to pro­
duce highly  digestible  silage  on a reliable  basis should  incorporate  the follow ­
ing into their management  system.
(a) Use ryegrass  swards.  This is a long-term  investment  and, provided  the 
cultivars  in the seed-mix  have  fairly  similar  heading-out  dates,  makes  iden­
tifying  the optimum  target  harvest  date straightforward.
(b) Harvest  the crop when seedheads  are beginning  to emerge  from the grass  
(do not  wait until  seed-heads  have  fully emerged).  This is the grass  growth  
stage  that tends  to give  the best  balance  between  yield  and quality for  farmers  
seeking  high levels  of animal  production.
(c) Ensure  there is not an accumulation  of dead or old stemmy  vegetation  at 
the base  of the crop. This  can readily happen  where  swards  were  not grazed  
bare in autumn  or where  considerable  winter  growth  occurred.  The effect  
of thus accumulating  what  by silage-harvesting  date will be old, low qual­
ity herbage  at the base of the crop could be to decrease  grass DMD at 
harvest  from 750 to 690 g/kg.
(d) Have  sufficient  flexibility  to be able to alter the harvesting  date, if neces ­
sary. For example,  if high yielding  lush crops  are subjected  to heavy  rain 
and strong  winds they can lodge and lie on the ground  under very wet 
conditions.  If this occurs,  the normal  rate of decrease  in digestibility  can 
triple,  leading  to up to a 10% unit drop in DMD  in a week.  Such  crops  need 
to be harvested  quickly  after  lodging  if such large  drops  in DMD  are to be 
avoided.  However,  the risk of lodging  is reduced  where  excessive  rate of 
total nitrogen-applications  (including  slurry)  are avoided.
(Hi) Preservation
The major  aims in preserving  grass as silage  are to store  the grass in a genu ­
inely air-free  environment  and to then inhibit  the activity  within  the silo (or 
bale) of undesirable  microbes.  This means  fast filling  and perfect  sealing  of
25
silos,  ensiling  clean  grass  that is free of contamination  and, if necessary,  further  
facilitating  preservation  by wilting,  using  additives  or using  other  management  
practices  that encourage  good preservation  by producing  “easy to preserve ” 
crops. The following  are the main guidelines:
(a) Use ryegrass  swards.  This long-term  investment  produces  crops  of higher  
sugar  concentration  that are easier  to preserve  than other  grasses.
(b) Complete  slurry-spreading  by mid March,  with undiluted  cattle  slurry  be­
ing evenly  spread  on short  grass at not more than 33 t/ha (3000  gal/ac.)  - 
spread  again  immediately  after  the first-cut  is 17 t/ha (1500  gal/ac.).
(c) In a two-cut  silage  system,  apply  N fertiliser  as early  as practicable,  using  
rates of 110 to 140 kg N/ha (90 to 110 units N/ac)  and 75 to 100 kg N/ha  
(60 to 80 units N/ac)  for first and second  cuts, respectively.  In some  cir­
cumstances  higher  rates may be justified.  Reduce  the above  fertiliser  N 
rates by 1.1 to 1.8 kg N/t undiluted  cattle  slurry  (i.e. 10 to 15 units  N/1000  
gallons)  applied  in February/March.  The corresponding  adjustments  for 
slurry  applied  after  the first-cut  are 0 to 1.1 kg nA slurry.
(d) Only apply  lime to silage  land before  March  or after  the silage-harvesting  
season  is completed  (i.e. do not apply  to crops  actually  growing  for silage.
(e) Wilting  has both advantages  and disadvantages.  It should  only be consid ­
ered when drying  conditions  are good, and should  not be attempted  in 
large narrow  rows. Ideally,  if a farmer  wants  to wilt, the grass should  be 
fully tedded  and given complete  ground-cover.  At a minimum,  where  a 
large mower  conditioner  is being  used,  the gates  at the back of the mower  
should  be opened  wide  to allow  the grass  be spread  in wide  rows. If wilt­
ing, aim at a target  of 250 to 300 g DM/kg  (i.e. 25% to 30% DM), to be 
achieved  within  24 hours  of mowing.  Besides  its obvious  effects on efflu ­
ent production,  successful  wilting  will virtually  ensure  good  preservation,  
but the improved  intake  of dry matter  is not correspondingly  converted  to 
additional  animal  product.
(f) Additives  can be beneficial  in some circumstances,  but must be chosen  
carefully  and appropriately,  and applied  properly,  if an economic  response  
to their  use is to be obtained.  Where  grass  is harvested  at an advanced  state  
of, maturity  (i.e. very stemmy)  or has been heavily  wilted,  conventional  
additives  are not normally  justified.  On the other  hand, if leafy crops of 
grass that have received  none or a little wilting  are being  ensiled,  the fol­
lowing  three  steps should  be followed:
(i) obtain  an estimate  of grass ensilability.  At a minimum  this involves  
measuring  grass  sugar  concentration  (expressed  as a proportion  of grass 
juice)  and preferably  also buffering  capacity.  Sugars  can be measured  
on farms,  while  both sugars  and buffering  capacity  can be measured  
on samples  submitted  to laboratories.  It is critical  that the samples  
taken propely  represent  the grass to be harvested,  and that they are 
properly  processed  prior to analysis.  Based  on an ensilability  index,  
the category  of additive  required,  as well as the appropriate  applica ­
tion rate, will be indicated.
26
(g)(ii) make  an estimate  of the fresh  yield  being  harvested.  This is necessary  
since the additive  will be applied  per tonne  of weight  harvested,  and 
cannot  accurately  be assessed  without  weighing  a strip or trailer-load  
of grass.  Doing  this is time well  spent  as a 40% underestimation  of the 
actual yield of grass would lead to applying  40% too little 
additive  and consequently  obtaining  an inferior  return  on the invest ­
ment  in the additive.
(iii) evenly  apply adequate  sugar or acid based additives  where grass  
ensilability  is difficult,  and effective  inoculants  where  ensiling  condi ­
tions are very good. However,  the recent  major  drop in beef prices  
now puts the economic  merit  of inoculant  additives  under  consider ­
able doubt  on cattle  farms.
Fast filling  and perfect  sealing  of the silos (or bales). This is crucial  and 
the single  most  important  factor  in achieving  good  preservation.
(iv) Aerobic  deterioration
The three main factors  affecting  aerobic  deterioration  once silos are opened  
are (1) management,  (2) weather,  (3) silage  characteristics.  Of these,  manage ­
ment  is the most  important  factor.  The aim of management  practices  must  be to  
minimise  the contact  time between  silage  and air. In bunker  silos,  this involves  
(a) moving  through  the silage  face quickly,  (b) presenting  easy-fed  animals  
with only  so much  silage  as they can eat in a day, (c) keeping  the silage  face as 
undisturbed  as possible. Rough  or careless  removal  of silage  from  the silo leaves  
behind  a tattered  and tossed  face into which  air can penetrate  deeply,  (d) keep ­
ing polythene  on top of the pit fully weighted  down  and taut to the front  of the 
silo and (e) not covering  the silage  face with polythene  at feeding  time as this 
creates  a mushroom-house  environment.  Unfortunately  there  are no chemicals  
available  to spray  on the silage  face at feedout  to prevent  aerobic  deterioration  
at and behind  the face.
All else being  equal,  slower  filling  of a silo is likely  to make  the silage  more  
prone  to aerobic  deterioration  at feeding  time.
With  regard  to weather, it  has been shown  in Grange  experiments  that warmer  
weather  at feedout  increases  the susceptibility  of silage  to aerobic  deteriora ­
tion. The management  recommendations  already  described  are crucially  
important  during  periods  of mild weather  as deterioration  is more  extensive  in 
such conditions.
Certain  silage  characteristics  such as the degree  of stemminess  or dryness  of 
silage  or its density  may influence  susceptibility  to aerobic  deterioration.  As 
demonstrated  in the Grange  experiments,  the major  chemical  components  in 
well preserved  silages  exert relatively  little impact  on aerobic  stability.  How ­
ever, other experiments  have demonstrated  that small amounts  of as yet 
unidentified  chemicals  are formed  in some  silages  and do improve  aerobic  sta­
bility.  The microbial  composition  of silage  when  exposed  to air and in particu ­
lar yeast numbers,  has a major  effect  on aerobic  stability.  The factors  which  
influence  this still need to be defined.

4. FUTURE  POTENTIAL
Irish grassland  has the potential  to support  highly  efficient  beef  production,  
and allow  a competitive  advantage  over  beef  producers  in other  countries.  Tak­
ing grass yield, quality  and efficiency  values  under  a current  good-manage ­
ment  system  for a geographical  location  such as Grange,  carcass  output  per ha 
grass  can be estimated  at 553 kg per year. There  exists  a realistic  potential,  as 
shown  in Table  22, to radically  increase  the efficiency  of producing  beef per 
hectare  of grassland  by increasing  grass production,  increasing  the proportion  
consumed  by grazing  rather  than after conserving,  and improving  quality  and 
efficiency  of utilisation,  to produce  almost  1000 kg carcass/ha  each year.
Strategies  for achieving  such an enormous  improvement  in productivity  will 
depend  on the adoption  of improved  technologies,  intensive  monitoring  allied  
to the prompt  use of accurate,  quantified  information  for decision-making  and 
the operation  of newer  production  systems  incorporating  both flexibility  and 
continuous,  active  management.
Critical  to improving  the annual  yield  of grass  are maintaining  good  soil drain ­
age, structure  (i.e. prevent  compaction)  and fertility  (P, K, lime and micro ­
nutrients).  Improved  grass  varieties  (and  possibly  grasses  selected  specifically  
for grazing  or conserving),  together  with high rates of N application  spread  in a 
time-critical  pattern  throughout  the year and the use of variable  length  grazing  
cycles  to provide  optimal  regrowth  recovery  intervals,  will be central  to deliv ­
ering the high yields. Alternatively,  some  clover-based  systems  will offer  the 
potential  to increase  beef output  per forage  hectare  compared  to the current  
standards,  but probably  not as much  as proposed  in Table  22.
Considerable  scope  exists  to increase  the proportion  of annual grass  DM  pro­
duction  consumed  by grazing,  and correspondingly  reduce  the proportion  con­
served,  by operating  systems  involving  as early a turnout  to grass  and as late a

removal  from grass as possible,  staggered  turnout  and removal,  and a manipu ­
lation  of the seasonal  grass supply  pattern  based  on the cultivars  used and the 
strategic  seasonal  pattern  of N fertiliser  use. Furthermore,  the feeding  of some  
of the supplementary  concentrates  at grass  that would  otherwise  have  been  sub­
sequently  fed indoors,  will allow  the finishing  of cattle  off of grass, with the 
consequent  reduction  in winter  forage  requirements.
Improvements  in the efficiency  with which  cattle consume  the grass pro­
duced  will depend  on the use of rotational  grazing  systems  involving  paddocks.  
Selection  of grasses  on the basis  of their  palatability  and intake  characteristics,  
together  with more  frequent  (and possibly  semi-automated)  allocation  of fresh  
grass  supplies  during  the day, will be necessary.  Critical  also however,  will be 
a more  comprehensive  knowledge  of grass  growth  rates,  actual  supplies  avail ­
able, grazing  rate and animal  behaviour.  Considerable  scope still exists to 
reduce  conservation  losses,  and will hinge primarily  on reducing  losses via 
effluent  (e.g. feeding  effluent  essentially  eliminates  this loss completely)  and 
restricting  aerobic  deterioration  at filling,  during  storage  and at feedout.  The 
scope  to reduce  losses  during  fermentation  appears  more  limited  at present.
Relatively  little opportunity  seems  available  to improve  the nutritive  value  
(e.g. DMD)  of grazed  grass in a situation  where  the aim is to increase  grazing  
efficiency  markedly.  However,  the use of ryegrass  actively  selected  for higher  
DMD,  quite  possibly  of late heading-out  date, together  with  a greater  extent  of 
control  on aerobic  deterioration  of silage  at feedout,  should  readily  achieve  the 
improvements  suggested  in Table  22.
5. FINAL  COMMENT
The optimal,  rigorous  management  of Irish grassland  is the route  to a viable  
ruminant  livestock  industry  in the future, assuming  we will have to 
operate  in a progressively  more  open economic  market-place  but where  there  
will be greater  regulations  regarding  food quality,  animal  welfare  and environ ­
mental  considerations.  Fundamental  to Irelands  ability  to take full advantage  
of the opportunities  provided  by our grassland  is a national,  co-ordinated,  
focussed,  comprehensive  and fundamental  research  effort  to understand  grass  
production,  consumption  and conversion  to quality  beef  - we must  pursue  the 
science  of grass  and beef.
This technology  must be quickly  transferred  to beef farmers  in the form of 
flexible,  adaptable  systems  (not blueprints)  and management  support  mecha ­
nisms (that will permit  prompt  and appropriate  decisions  based on accurate  
knowledge)  so they can cash-in  on grass.

RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  SWARD  HEIGHT  AND  HERBAGE  YIELD
The use of POST  GRAZING  sward  surface  height  as a grassland  manage ­
ment  aid has been advocated  for a number  of years. However,  tbe use of PRE ­
GRAZING  sward surface  height  as an estimater  of the HERBAGE  YIELD  
available  for grazing  animals  has not been widely  used in Ireland.  Where  pre­
grazing  sward  height  is being  used,  tables  which  relate  sward  height  to herbage  
yield are those  derived  in other  countries.  During  the past 3-years,  research  at 
Grange  has examined  the relationship  between  pre-grazing  sward surface  height  
and herbage  DRY  MATTER  yields.  Over  this period  close to 3,000  plots had 
both their height  recorded  and actual  yields  determined,  and these height  and 
yield data have been used to generate  IRISH  height  to yield conversion  tables.  
This article  outlines  the main results  of this research.
WHY  USE PRE-GRAZING  SWARD  HEIGHT?
The pre-grazing  sward  height  can be used as a grassland  management  tool, 
helping  the grassland  manager  become  familiar  with herbage  yield and thereby  
facilitating  a process  where  animals  may be offered  “known ” herbage  allow ­
ances.
MEASURING  SWARD  SURFACE  HEIGHT  
Sward surface  height  (i.e. the height  of the grass)  may be measured in a number  
of ways.
30
1. Ruler
The simplest  means  of measuring  sward height  is with a ruler,  where  a ruler  
is inserted  vertically  into the standing  crop  and the height  from  the ground  to 
the “top” of the sward  is then measured.  However, big  variation  can emerge  
in deciding  what  is the “top” of the sward,
2. Sward  Stick
A sward  stick consists  of a graduated  metal  rod (with marks  each 0.5 cm) 
fitted with a perspex  arm. The sward  stick is inserted  vertically  into the 
sward  and the perspex  arm is lowered  until it comes  in contact  with a leaf. 
The reading  on the shaft  is taken  as the sward  height.  Both  ruler  and sward  
stick  are somewhat  slow to use, especially  if large  areas  are to be measured,  
and many  readings  are needed.  Readings  are manually  recorded.
3. Plate  meter
Sward  height  can be measured  with a plate meter,  of which  there are many  
types. In general,  a plate  is allowed  to settle  on and compress  the sward,  the 
height  between  the ground  and the  plate  being  measured  as the sward  height.  
Readings  may need  some  degree  of manual  recording,  but considerable  scope  
exists  to automate  and streamline  this process.
4. Other  techniques  that for example  bounce  light  or sound waves  off the sward  
have also been investigated,  with varying  degrees  of success.
The use of plate  meters  is becoming  more  common  and some  are now  being  
manufactured  in Ireland.
SWARD  STICK
At the lower  sward  heights  (4-6 cm) the sward  stick  resulted  in height  values  
which  were 1 to 2 cm GREATER  than those from the AFT meter. In taller  
swards  this difference  between  the two approaches  to measurement  was in­
creased  and, as a result  of these  large  differences,  yields  based  on uncompressed  
sward height  CANNOT  be read from Table 1 and therefore  the sward  stick  
needs  to have its own conversion  tables  developed.
CHARACTERISTICS  OF PLATE  METER
As plate meters  measure  compressed  sward  height,  the heavier  the plate the 
greater  the degree  of sward  compression and the lower  the resulting  sward  height. 
Thus,  various  meters  need to be standardised  so that each meter  results  in the 
same degree  of sward  compression  and height. The plate meter  used in the 
present  experiment  was developed  by An Foras  Taluntais  (AFT)  in the early  
1980 ’s and consisted  of a 30 cm diameter  plate which  places  a force  of 2.8 kg/ 
m^ on the sward. The meter  was designed  to automatically  record  the sward  
height  and calculate  the average  height  for a large number  of readings  and dis­
play the results  on a LCD panel.
HEIGHT/YIELD  RELATIONSHIP
Table 1 shows  a range  of sward  heights  and the corresponding  measured  dry 
matter  yields.  The swards  used were  generally  at the end of a 3-week  rotation.  
The data in the Table  are based  on almost  3,000  plots where  height  and yields  
were  actually  measured.  Eleven  different  swards  were  measured  over  the three  
full growing  seasons  during  the course  of the Grange  study. While  height  was
31
measured  from the ground  to the plate, the yield (in kg DRY MATTER  per 
hectare)  was measured  in the grazing  horizon  above  a stubble  of 4 cm (not to 
ground  level).
Table 1 covers  sward  surface  heights  within  the range 6 to 25 cm, that is, 
within  the limits  of “normal ” PRE-GRAZING  conditions.  At heights  greater  
than 25 cm, the height  to yield  relationships  are much less accurate  because  the 
sward  tends  to fall over and lodge  under  the weight  of the plate.  Consequently,  
the values  in Table 1 should  not be extended  for use on silage  swards.
The relationship  between  sward  surface  height  and herbage  dry matter  yield  
DOES  VARY  from sward  to sward  (i.e. one crop (field)  to the next) and also 
varies  with season. Thus,  for example,  stemmy  swards  give a higher  height  
reading  as the plate is supported  on the stems. Measurement  taken on lush 
pastures  after  heavy rainfalls  or in frosty  conditions  will also be associated  with 
errors. The way the meter  is lowered  into the sward  has an effect  on height.  
Dropping  the plate meter  with force onto the sward  will compress  the sward  
surface  to a greater  extent  than doing  the procedure  gently. When  measuring  
sward  height,  the more readings  that are taken the closer  the average  height  
value  will be to the true field value. Aim to take at least 50 readings  per pad- 
dock.
USE OF THE TABLE
Table  1 has five columns.  The FIRST  column  is the compressed  sward  
surface  height  measured  in centimetres.  The SECOND  column  relates  sward  
surface  height  to HERBAGE  DRY  MATTER yields  (in kg DM/ha)  in the early  
part of the season  and spans the Spring/Summer  period  from the start of the 
growing  season  to mid-June.  This is the stage when  grass swards  are in their  
reproductive  growth  phase  (after  the winter).  The THIRD  column  covers  the 
height  to yield relationship  for the period  mid-June  to late August,  when,  de­
pending  on management,  sward  quality  can vary widely  and some  grasses  will 
tend to form seed heads. The FOURTH  column  covers  the remainder  of the 
year to late October/early  November  when  grasses  are in the vegetative  stage. 
The FIFTH  column,  gives  an overall  yield  value  for the whole  season  for each  
of the sward  heights.
NOTE  that the yields  given in Table 1 are the AVERAGE  values  for each  
sward  height  over the range  of swards  used in the study. There  IS variation  
from  one sward  to the next. The analysis  of the Grange  data  relating  height  and 
yield  show  that at any sward  height  DRY  MATTER  YIELD  may  vary by PLUS  
or MINUS  500 kg DM/ha  from the value  predicted  in Table 1. THUS,  VAL ­
UES IN THE TABLE  CAN ONLY  BE USED  AS AN INDICATOR  OF 
YIELD  AND  NOT  THE “ACTUAL ” YIELD  AT ANY  SWARD  HEIGHT.
USING  THE  TABLE  UNDER  FIELD  CONDITIONS
If the average  pre-grazing  sward  height  is 12 to 15 cm then herbage  on offer  
is equivalent  to approximately  1600  to 2100  kg DM/ha.  At a herbage  availabil ­
ity 2000  kg DM/ha  and offering  dairy  cows  a herbage  allowance  of 20 kg DM/  
head/day,  there are 100 grazing  days per hectare  (40 grazing  days/acre).  Like ­
wise,  if 15 kg DM/head/day  is being  offered  suckler  cows  or drystock,  there are 
the equivalent  of 133 grazing  days/ha  (or 54 grazing  days/ac)  on offer. If pre­
grazing  sward  height  is 18 to 20 cm, then  herbage  on offer  is equivalent  to 2600
32
to 3000 kg DM/ha.  Herbage  yields  of greater  than approximately  3500  kg DM/  
ha or a pre-grazing  sward  height  of 23 to 24 cm, is probably  indicative  of sur­
plus grass.
If grass allowances  are offered  on the basis of sward height,  the actual  
allowance  may be at most  plus or minus  1 kg DM/head/day  from the expected  
allowance  for cattle. Consistency  in measurement  is important  if the operator ’s 
eye is to be trained  in assessing  herbage  yield and thus be an effective  judge  in 
estimating  herbage  availability.  As mentioned  previously,  the main benefit  of 
correctly  using the plate meter is to train the grassland  managers  eye into 
assessing  herbage  yield  in the standing  crop. AS A “GENERAL ” RULE  EACH  
CENTIMETER  RISE  IN COMPRESSED  SWARD  HEIGHT  WILL  REPRE ­
SENT  AN INCREASE  IN YIELD  OF 150 TO 200 KG DM/HA.
OTHER  PLATE  METERS
The AFT  meter  has been compared  with a second  plate  meter,  manufactured  
in Cork. The Cork meter  consisted  of a 32 x 32 cm, 11/2 mm, stainless  steel 
plate  which  exerts  a compressing  force  of 5.4 kg/m2  on the sward  (nearly  twice  
the force  of the AFT meter). The Cork  meter  being  heavier  resulted  in sward  
heights  which  were  lower  (10%)  than the AFT  meter. However,  as the percent ­
age difference  was relatively  small, the error associated  will be of little  
practical  consequence  and the Cork  meter  may be used to record  sward  height  
and read from  the herbage  yield values  in Table 1.
The plate on the Cork meter  is carried  on a central  shaft and as the meter  is 
lowered  into the sward  the plate rises on the shaft which  is notched  at 0.5 cm 
intervals.  A counter  with a sprocket  wheel  counts  the notches  as the plate  rises 
(not as the plate falls as it is removed  from the sward).  The number  of height  
readings  taken  is recorded  on a second  hand operated  counter.  Using  the read­
ing on the shaft  counter  and the number  of individual  height  readings  taken,  the 
average  sward  surface  height  and herbage  yield  can be calculated.
If the Cork  meter  is to be used to estimate  sward  height  and thus herbage  DM 
yield from  Table 1, the following  procedure  should  take place.
1) Record  the starting  reading  on the shaft  recorder.
2) Record  the final reading  on the shaft  recorder.
3) Record  the number  of height  readings  taken.
Then use the following  formula  to get the sward  height  (in cm):
Sward  height  (cm) = [Final  reading]  minus  [starting  reading]
[number  readings  taken  x 2]
Example  1: 10 height  readings  taken,  starting  value  = 17,096  
and final value  = 17,568
height  (cm)  = [17,568-17,0961 = 472 = 23.6 cm
[10x2]  20
Example  2: 25 height  readings  taken,  starting  value  = 19,000  
final value  = 19,250
height  (cm)  = [19,250-19,000]  = 250 = 5 cm
\25TT]  ^O ”
33
NOTE  that these  height  readings  will be some  10% lower  than those  taken  with
the AFT  meter. The mathematical  process  above  is not necessary  with  the AFT
meter,  as all calculations  are carried  out automatically.
SUMMARY
* Sward  height  is a useful  management  aid and is a help in training  the “eye” 
to herbage  supply.
* Sward  height  and pasture  dry matter  yield  available  for grazing  are related,  
but the relationship  varies  with pasture  type and season.
* The Grange  Table  can be used as a guideline  for farmers  who want  to relate  
sward  height  to herbage  dry matter  yield.
* Not all means of measuring  pasture  height - are directly  comparable.  
Different  conversion  tables  are needed  for each instrument.

INTRODUCTION
Unlike  improvements  in feeding  and management  which  have  ongoing  costs  
associated  with them,  genetic  improvement  is permanent  and is largely  free of 
on-going  costs. Furthermore,  genetic  improvements  do not have the negative  
connotations  which  often accompany  feeding  and management  improvements  
(e.g. hormones  and feed additives,  environmental  risks  from  excessive  nutrient  
loads as fertiliser  or as slurry,  animal  welfare  considerations  of confinement  
and housing).  With the increasing  competitiveness  of the other  livestock  sec­
tors such as pigs and poultry,  the Irish beef industry  must improve  and exploit  
genetic  potential  to the maximum.  Otherwise  it will become  even  more  uncom ­
petitive  relative  to the pig and poultry  meat industries  than at present.  Further ­
more,  it could  also fall behind  its international  competitors  in beef  production  
whose  breeding  programmes  are already  well advanced.  There  are two compo ­
nents  to the production  of animals  of high genetic  quality  (1) identification  and 
production  of genetically  superior  breeding  stock and (2) exploitation  of this 
genetically  superior  breeding  stock through  their widespread  use within  the 
industry.  The first requires  comprehensive  breeding  programmes  while the 
second  requires  the use by commercial  producers  of the genetically  superior  
animals  produced  from the breeding  programmes.
IMPROVING  GENETIC  MERIT
Improvement  of genetic  merit involves  the identification  and selection  of 
genetically  superior  animals  in structured  breeding  programmes.  The perform ­
ance of an animal  is a function  of its genotype  and environment.  There  have  
been considerable  improvements  in environmental  factors  such as nutrition,  
disease  control  and housing  but these are not passed  on from generation  to 
generation  and generally  require  ongoing  costs in order  to be maintained.  The 
genotype  of the animal  on the other  hand  is the genetic  material  it inherits  from  
its parents,  half of which  is passed  on from generation  to generation.  To bring  
about  genetic  improvement,  it is necessary  to separate  out the proportion  of 
performance  (growth,  carcass  traits, feed efficiency  etc.) which  is due to the 
genes  it carries  (genotype)  and then select  for the desired  traits.
ESTIMATED  BREEDING  VALUES  (EBVs)
Since  true breeding  value  cannot  be measured,  estimates  of it are made.
Sire: In the past the estimation  of breeding  value  was done  by the contempo ­
rary comparison  method  having  corrected  for environmental  effects  such as sex
35
and age of dam. However,  contemporary  comparison  was only applicable  to 
animals  reared  under  the same  conditions  and as pedigree  herds  are generally  
small,  relatively  few breeding  values  could  be calculated  and/or  their  accuracy  
was low.
The development  of BLUP  (best  linear  unbiassed  prediction)  has overcome  
the major  limitations  of contemporary  comparison.  This technique  uses all the 
records  available  on an animal  and on all its relatives,  to partition  the genetic  
and environmental  effects  and give a more  reliable  EBV. Genetic  linkages  be­
tween  herds  allow  evaluations  to be made  across  herds.  BLUP  can also account  
for associations  between  traits which further improves  its accuracy.  For 
example  200 day weight  is positively  associated  with 400 day weight.  EBVs  
are expressed  in the units in which  they are measured  (e.g. weights  in kg, mus­
cle scores  in points)  and relative  to the breed  average  for a specified  year. EBV  
is an estimate  of the genetic  merit  of the animal  itself  but only half of this is 
passed  on to the progeny.  It is expected  that EBVs  for Irish pedigree  beef  bulls  
will be available  shortly.
Dam EBV: The performance  of a calf is also influenced  by the genetic  
maternal  and milk production  traits of its dam. BLUP  can separate  out these  
and thus produce  EBVs  for dams similar  to those  for sires. The maternal  ge­
netic  traits  will be  passed  on to the  progeny  of both sexes but of course  they can 
only be expressed  by the female  progeny.  Of particular  interest  is the genetic  
potential  of the dam for milk  production,  a major  factor  determining  calf  wean ­
ing weight.  In beef  breeds  this EBV  is designated  200-day  milk.
IRISH  BREEDING  PROGRAMME
The main elements  of a structured  breeding  programme  are outlined  in 
Figure  1. They are (1) on-farm  weight  recording  in pedigree  herds,  (2) central  
performance  testing  of young  bulls,  (3) central  progeny  testing  of bulls,  and (4) 
importation  of genetically  superior  breeding  stock as live animals,  semen  or 
embryos.  All these elements  are used in the Irish cattle  breeding  programme  
which  has been described  in detail  by Grogan  (1992).  Up until now the Irish 
programme  has been operated  by the Department  of Agriculture,  Food  and For­
estry in cooperation  with the breed  societies  and the Al stations.  At present,  a 
national  cattle  breeding  authority  is being  established  to take over  the control of 
cattle  breeding.  In Ireland,  beef bull proofs  are expressed  as relative  breeding  
values  (RBVs)  with  the breed  mean  = 100. The RBV  for a trait is an estimate  of 
the bull’s genetic  merit  for that trait relative  to an average  bull of the breed. The  
superiority/inferiority  of a bull is indicated  by the extent  to which  his RBV  
deviates  from 100. Bulls  of 110 or greater  are from the top 15% of the breed  
population  while  bulls  of 90 or less are from  the bottom  15% of the breed.  One 
half of a bull ’s superiority  or inferiority  is passed  on to his progeny.  RBVs  are 
reported  separately  for growth  rate, carcass  conformation  and carcass  leanness,  
and feed  efficiency  values are available  for some  performance  tested  bulls. From 
these an overall  beef merit index is calculated.  This combines  the individual  
trait values  into a single  index  of economic  worth.  Al bulls are also surveyed  
for calving  ease,  calf mortality  to 48  hours  and gestation  length.  The results  are 
expressed  as the expected  levels  for matings  to Friesian  cows.

Fig. 1 Illustration  of genetic  improvement  programme  for beef  cattle  breeds
The relevant  genetic  data needed  by the users  of Al are published  each spring  
in the Approved  Al Beef  and Dairy  Bull Lists. Approved  beef  bulls are catego ­
rised as approved  for widespread  use (W) or approved  for limited  use (T). The 
W category  are high genetic  merit  bulls which  have been progeny  tested  and 
surveyed  for ease of calving  and for which  semen  is readily  available.  T bulls  
have good performance  test and/or  ease of calving  ratings  and are undergoing  
progeny  test.
GENETIC  PROGRESS
An important  measure  of the success  of a breeding  programme  is the rate ot 
genetic  improvement  over time. In dairying  for example,  the rate of genetic  
progress  in milk fat and protein  yields  has almost  trebled  (0.4%  to 1.1% per 
year)  for sires born over  the 10 year  period  1980-1990  (Dillon. Crosse,  Buckley  
and Flynn,  1996).  There  are no published  estimates  of the changes  in beef  breed  
mean values  over time but some indication  of genetic  change  can be deduced  
from the ratings  of the bulls entering  the Approved  Bull List compared  with 
those  of the bulls leaving  it.
37
Growth  rate: The mean growth  rate RBVs  for the Charolais,  Hereford,  
Limousin  and Simmental  bulls approved  for widespread  use in 1991 and 1996  
are shown  in Table I. Also shown  are the RBVs  for the bulls  included  in the list 
in 1991 but since  removed,  and the new bulls  added  to the list in 1996.  In 1991 
there  were  only 5 Charolais  approved  for widespread  use and they had a mean  
growth  rate RBV of 107. Since  then, 4 of these (mean  growth  rate RBV 106) 
have  been  removed  from  the list. By 1996  there  were 14 Charolais  bulls  (mean  
RBV  for growth  rate of 110) approved  for widespread  use. Only one new bull 
was added  to the list in 1996 and he had an RBV  for growth  of 115. Thus,  there  
is evidence  of some  improvement  (107 to 110) in the genetic  merit  for growth  
rate of the approved  Al Charolais  bulls from 1991 to 1996. However,  this 
improvement  only brought  the mean  of the Charolais  bulls  into line with  that of 
the other  breeds.

In 1991 there were 22 Hereford  bulls with a mean growth  RBV of 109 
approved  for widespread  use. Since  then 14 of them (also with a mean  growth  
RBV  of 109) have  been  dropped  from the list. By 1996  there  were 16 Hereford  
bulls approved  for widespread  use. Tbeir  mean growth  rate RBV of 110 was 
little different  from the 1991 value.  The 7 new bulls added  in 1996 also had a 
mean growth  RBV of 110. Thus, there has been little change  in the growth  
RBV of approved  Hereford  bulls over the past 5 years so the only change  in 
genetic  merit  of approved  Al Hereford  bulls is that which  has occurred  in the 
breed  mean.
For the Limousin  and Simmental  breeds,  mean growth  RBV for approved  
bulls was in fact one point  lower  in 1996 than in 1991.  In both breeds  also, the 
bulls  dropped  from the list were  3 points  below  tbe list mean  suggesting  that to 
some  degree  it was the poorer  bulls which  were dropped.  However,  it is also 
true for both breeds  that the bulls added  to the list were below  the list mean.
Generally,  there is little to suggest  that there has been any significant  
increase  in RBV  for growth  rate over the last 5 years in the approved  Al bulls. 
There  is little difference  between  the breeds  in tbe growth  RBVs  of the bulls 
approved  for widespread  use. Therefore,  the only improvement  in genetic  merit  
of Al bulls  has been that which has occurred  in the breed  means  (of which there  
are no published  esiimates).
38
Calving  ease:  It might  be argued that improvement  in growth  RBV  was  con­
strained  by selection  for ease  of calving. The mean  calving  difficulty  scores  for 
1991 and 1996 for the Charolais,  Hereford,  Limousin  and Simmental  breeds  
are shown  in Table 2. Mean calving  difficulty  score for Charolais  actually  
increased  (4.1 to 5.7) from 1991 to 1996 but most of this was due to a single  
bull with a high calving  difficulty  (19.8%)  which  was added  to the list in 1996.  
For all the other  breeds  there was little change  in mean  calving  difficulty  per­
centage  between  1991 and 1996.

EXPLOITING  GENETIC  POTENTIAL
At producer  level,  genetic  improvement  comes  mainly  from the widespread  
use of genetically  superior  sires.  This is discussed  under  two headings  (1) the 
mean  differences  between  beef  breeds  and (2) the genetic  differences  between  
sires within  a breed.  In addition  to the genetic  merit  of the sire, breed  type of the 
suckler  dam is also considered.
DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN  SIRE  BREEDS
The relative  merits  of the different  beef sire breeds  have been well docu ­
mented  and are summarised  in Table  3. Other  than the Angus  which  had a lower  
value,  slaughter  weight  for age differed  little between  Friesian,  Hereford,  MRI,  
Limousin  and Blonde,  while  Simmental,  Belgian  Blue and Charolais  were 4- 
7% superior  to these. All beef  crosses  had higher  kill-out  values  than Friesians  
with the continentals  having  higher  values  than the British  breeds.  Hereford,  
MRI and Limousin  were 4%-5%  superior  to Friesians  and Angus  in carcass  
weight  for age while  the other breeds  were 8%-l  1% superior.  Muscle  weight  
for age was similar  for Friesian  and Hereford  even though  the latter had 4% 
more carcass.  All continentals  produced  11%-19%  more muscle  than Friesian  
and Hereford  with the Belgian  Blue having  the highest  production  of muscle.  
Muscle  size essentially  paralleled  muscle  weight  for age. There  was relatively  
little difference  across  breeds  in the proportion  of higher  value muscle  which  
was identical  for the dairy and British  breeds  and was 2%-3%  higher  for the 
continentals.  All beef crosses  had considerably  superior  conformation  to
39
Friesians.  Limousin,  Belgian  Blue and Charolais  had the best conformation.  
Fat score  was considerably  higher  for the British  breeds  than for the dairy  and 
continental  breeds.  There  was little difference  in fat score between  Friesian,  
MRI, Limousin  and Simmental,  but Blonde  d’Aquitaine,  Belgian  Blue and 
Charolais  had lower  fat scores  than the others.

DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN  SIRES  WITHIN  A BREED
The mean productivity  differences  between  the breeds  described  above  are 
now widely  appreciated  by producers  and there  has been  a large  change  in beef 
breed  usage  from predominantly  British  breeds 10-15 years ago to predomi ­
nantly  continental  beef breeds  at present.  This change  has been accompanied  
nationally  by a marked  increase  in mean carcass  weight  and an improvement  in 
carcass  traits. The next major  improvement  in productivity  must now come  
from the identification  and widespread  use of genetically  superior  bulls within  
each  breed.  For some  traits,  the difference  between  bulls  of the same  breed  can 
be as great  as the mean  differences  between  breeds.  The Al bulls approved  for 
widespread  use are on average  11% (Angus),  8% (Belgian  Blue), 10% 
(Charolais),  10% (Hereford),  8% (Limousin)  and 9% (Simmental)  above  their  
respective  breed means  for growth  rate. Thus,  a change  from a  bull of unknown  
genetic  merit  (and  therefore  assumed  to be average  for the breed) to  an average  
approved  Al bull automatically  improves  performance  of the progeny  by about  
5%. A further  change  from the average  approved  Al bull to the best approved  
Al bull within  a breed  would  give about  a further  3% improvement  in perform ­
ance. Therefore,  within  a breed,  performance  can be improved  by 8-10%  by 
using  the best approved  Al bull compared  with a an average  bull of that breed. 
In suckled  weanling  production,  a bull with an EBV of -t-30 kg for weaning  
weight  would  produce weanlings  15 kg heavier  than  the average  bull. This  would 
be worth  about  £700  annually  in a 50 cow suckler  herd or £3000  to £4000  more  
over the lifetime  of the bull.

RANKING  BULLS  ACROSS  BREEDS
Where  bulls have beef ratings  they can be ranked  for performance  across  
breeds.  This permits  the best or most  suitable  bull to be selected  for use almost  
irrespective  of breed.  The 1996 Approved  AI Beef Bull List (Department  of 
Agriculture.  Food and Forestry,  1996)  contains  127 bulls of which  71 are ap­
proved  for widespread  use. All these  have RBVs  for growth  rate, carcass  con­
formation  and carcass  leanness  and some  have  a feed efficiency  rating.  In addi­
tion they all have been surveyed  for ease of calving.

+Mean  values  for Angus  bulls approved  for widespread  use (1996)
Using  a combination  of the Beef  Progeny  Test Data  included  in the Approved  
AI Beef  Bull List, and the data from the Grange  Beef  Breed  Evaluation  Pro­
gramme,  an across-breed  beef value  (ABV)  was calculated  for all the AI bulls
41
approved  for widespread  use in 1996. This was done using the Angus  breed  
mean as the baseline  (i.e. Angus  breed mean = 100) for growth  rate, carcass  
conformation  and carcass  leanness  (Table  4). Feed  efficiency  was not included  
because  only a small number  of bulls have feed efficiency  ratings.  From  this, 
together  with the published  within breed RBVs,  ABVs were calculated.  A 
sample  of the values  for the poorest  and best  growth  rate bulls  of each  breed  are 
shown  in Table  5 and the results  were expressed  as the expected  superiority/  
inferiority  (£ per head)  of the male  progeny  (ideally  it should  be the mean  of the 
male and female  progeny)  of a bull. A sample  of these values  relative  to the 
breed  mean  for an Angus  calf  are shown  in Table  6.

While  recognising  the greater  suitability  of certain  breeds  to certain  produc ­
tion systems  no account  could  be taken of this, and the bulls were compared  
directly  on the basis of growth  rate ABV. The range in ABV was as follows:  
Angus  108 to 116, Hereford  105 to 121, Limousin  104 to 123, Simmental  110 
to 127, Belgian  Blue 115 to 119 and Charolais  114 to 130. Of the total 71 bulls  
approved  for widespread  use in 1996, 19 had growth  ABVs  of 120 or greater  
(10 Charolais,  2 Hereford,  3 Limousin,  4 Simmental).  Thus,  about  one-quarter  
of the AI bulls approved  for widespread  use were more than 20% superior  in 
growth  rate to the mean  of the Angus  breed.
Compared  with the  Angus  breed  mean, all bulls  approved  for widespread  use 
increased  male  calf value for beef  production.  This increase  ranged from £23 to 
£49 for Angus,  £23 to £59 for Hereford,  £22 to £76 for Limousin,  £25 to £75
42
for Simmental,  £55 to £61 for Belgian  Blue,  and £45 to £87 for Charolais  sired  
calves.  Calves  from  the best  Angus  bull were  more  valuable  than those  from  the 
poorest  bulls  of all other  breeds  except  the Belgian  Blue.  At the top of the scale  
the male  calves  from  the best Charolais  bull were about  £10 more  valuable  than 
those from the best Simmental  and Limousin  bulls which  were similar.  These  
in turn were  £15-£20  more  valuable  than the calves  from  the best Hereford  and 
Belgian  Blue  bulls  which  in turn were about  £10 more  valuable  than  the calves  
from the best  Angus  bull. At the extremes  the calves  of the best bull (Charolais  
CF44) were worth  about  £65 per head more than those of the poorest  bull 
(Angus  CUO).
GENETIC  MERIT  OF SUCKLER  COWS
Suckler  cows should  be of moderate  size and should  produce  a calf of high  
weaning  weight  every  year. Due to hybrid  vigour,  crossbred  cows  are superior  
to purebreds  for suckling.  Compared  with purebreds,  crossbreds  have earlier  
puberty,  better  fertility,  shorter  calving  interval,  better  calf survival  and better  
calf growth  rate. In a large scale US experiment  (Cundiff,  Gregory  and Koch, 
1982),  crossbred  (Hereford  x Angus)  cows  were  compared  with purebred  cows  
(Hereford  and Angus)  both  rearing  calves  from the same sires.  Weaning weight  
was 23 kg (15%)  greater  per cow exposed  to breeding  for the crossbred  cows  
than for the purebreds.  There  were two components  to this superiority.  Two- 
thirds of it was due to an increase  in the calf crop weaned  reflecting  better  
overall  fertility  in the crossbred  cows.  The remainder  was an increase  in wean ­
ing weight,  reflecting  higher  milk production  by the crossbred  cows. This 
increased  production  from crossbreds  over purebreds  was due to heterosis  or 
hybrid  vigour.  Increasing  heterosis  in the calf  by using  a sire of a third breed  on 
crossbred  cows  further  increases  calf weaning  weight.  In the US study  referred  
to above, the addition  of the heterosis  of the crossbred  calves  (8%)  to that of the 
crossbred  cows  (15%)  resulted  in a 36 kg increase  (23%)  in the weight  of calf 
weaned  per cow of which  about two thirds was due to the crossbred  cows.  
Clearly,  therefore,  in suckled  beef  production  the cow should  be crossbred  and 
the bull should  be from a third breed.
Dairy  cross  cows
Certain  beef  x dairy  cows  are quite  suitable  as suckler  dams  because  they are 
crossbred  (heterosis),  are of moderate  size (low maintenance  costs),  and are 
good  milkers  (good  calf growth  rates).  In terms  of these  criteria  the more suit­
able beef X dairy suckler  cow types  are Angus  x Friesian,  Hereford  x Friesian  
and Limousin  x Friesian.  Other continental  x Friesians  (e.g. Charolais  x 
Friesians)  are larger  and have  higher  maintenance  requirements.  In the past,  the 
most  common  suckler  cow was the Hereford  x Friesian.  With  the decline  in the 
use of Hereford,  and the increase  in the use  of continental  breeds  in dairy  herds,  
Hereford  x Friesian  cows are now less readily  available  and the closest  conti ­
nental  cross in size is the Limousin  x Friesian.  These  two breed crosses  were  
compared  in an experiment  at Grange.

Mean  cow liveweight  throughout  the year was 16 kg (507 v. 523 kg) greater  
for the Limousin  cross  cows.  There  was very little difference  between  the two 
breed  types  in the performance  of their  female  progeny  (Table  7), but when  the 
males  were reared  as young  bulls where  they had the opportunity  to express  
their  full growth  potential,  the Limousin  cross  progeny  were 15 kg carcass  weight  
heavier.  This was mainly  due to a better  kill-out  for the progeny  of the Limousin  
cross  cows  rather  than to a better  growth  rate.  Carcass  fat score  was 0.3 (males)  
and 0.5 (females)  lower  for the Limousin  crosses  indicating  that they could  be 
taken  to a greater  weight  than the Hereford  crosses  without  becoming  overfat.  
In summary,  therefore,  substituting  a Limousin  x Friesian  for a Hereford  x 
Friesian  suckler  cow would  increase  mean  cow liveweight  by about  3%. How ­
ever, carcass  output  per cow would  also be increased  by about  3% at the same  
age and carcass  quality  would  be better.  The progeny  of the Limousin  cross  
cows  could  also be taken  to a heavier  weight,  thereby  further  increasing  carcass  
output  per cow.
Sources  of suckler  herd replacements
The breeds  of sire used on dairy cows are about  50% Friesians,  20% early  
maturing  beef breeds,  10% Limousin  and 20% other continental.  Thus, the 
number  of beef x dairy heifers  suitable  as suckler  herd replacements  (early 
maturing  plus Limousin  crosses)  is about 150,000  in total. Inevitably,  some  of 
these are slaughtered  as maiden  heifers  for beef so in practice  not more than 
about 100,000  suckler  herd replacements  can come  from the dairy herd annu ­
ally. Since  the suckler  herd requires  up to 200,000  replacements  annually,  at 
least half of these (100,000)  must come from within  the suckler  herd itself. 
Indeed, to minimise  disease  risks and simplify  management,  many farmers  
prefer  to replace  from within,  rather  than buying-in.  This raises  the question  of 
how replacement  heifers  with the desired  attributes  of heterosis,  milkiness,  and 
moderate  size can be produced  within  a suckler  herd where  the main  objective  
must  be the production  of high quality  meat animals.

Where  an existing  crossbred  cow herd  is being  mated  to a terminal  sire of one 
of the large continental  breeds  (e.g. Charolais),  retention  of the heifer  progeny  
for breeding  will ultimately  result  over a few generations  in cows which  are 
almost  pure bred and which  are quite large. Such cows (upgraded  Charolais)  
were compared  with Hereford  x Friesian  cows in an experiment  at Grange  
(Table  8). Mean cow liveweight  was about 100 kg heavier  for the upgraded  
Charolais  but their  milk yield was only two-thirds  (7.9 vs. 12.2 kg/day)  that of 
the dairy  crosses.  Consequently,  their calf growth  rate was lower  (1.08 v. 1.17 
kg/day) during the suckling  period  and weaning  weight  was 20 kg lower.  
Although  not evident  in this experiment,  later  puberty  and lower  fertility  would  
also be expected  in the upgraded  Charolais  cows.  While  the superior  genetic  
potential  of the upgraded  Charolais  progeny  would  manifest  itself  in a higher  
post weaning  growth  rate and superior  carcass  merit  at slaughter,  this may not 
be sufficient  to compensate  for the higher  maintenance  requirement  and poorer  
fertility  of the dams  and the poorer  pre-weaning  growth  rate of the calves.
Where  replacements  are kept from within  the herd,  ideally  they should  have  
the desired  suckler  cow attributes  (heterosis,  milk, moderate  size). This could  
be achieved  by criss-crossing  two beef  breeds  one of which  is of moderate  size 
and one of which has reasonable  milking  ability.  Two such breeds  are the 
Limousin  (moderate  size)  and the Simmental  (milkiness). Then,  any of the other  
large breeds  (Charolais,  Belgian  Blue, Blonde  d’Aquitaine)  can be used as a 
terminal sire  thus maximising  heterosis in the calf  and ensuring  good  calf  growth  
rates both before  and after weaning,  and good carcass  quality.
Where  the existing  herd is beef x Friesian,  replacements  could  be produced  
by using  a Limousin  AI bull on 40%-50%  of the cows.  In genotype,  the result ­
ant progeny  would  be 50% Limousin,  25% beef and 25% Friesian  (the 25% 
beef  could  also be Limousin  giving  75% Limousin).  Such  animals  would  main ­
tain heterosis  for reproductive  traits and milking  ability  and would  still be of 
moderate  size. To produce  the next generation  of replacements,  these would  be 
crossed  with a Simmental  AI bull giving heifers which would be 50% Simmental  
and 50% other.  These  in turn would  be crossed  with Limousin  and so the geno ­
type of the herd  would  fluctuate  between  about  two-thirds  Simmental  plus one- 
third Limousin  and two-thirds  Limousin  plus one-third  Simmental.
Where  AI cannot  be used,  an effort  should  still be made  to maintain  heterosis  
in the suckler  cow herd. This could  be achieved  by rotational  use of a different
45
breed of bull every few years when the bull is replaced.  Unfortunately,  this 
involves  some  compromises  in both cow and progeny  potential  but judicious  
selection  of the breed  mix should  ensure  good  overall  herd performance  .
In summary,  using  replacements  from the dairy herd permits  the use of the 
best beef bulls on all the suckler  herd thereby  maximising  the value of the 
calves  or beef  produced.  However,  the dairy herd can provide  only about  half 
of the replacements  required  by the suckler  herd,  so producers  must  provide  up 
to half  of their  own replacements.  Suitable  replacements  can be produced  by a 
strategic  cross  breeding  programme  based  on the use of selected  AI sires from  
the appropriate  breeds  on 40-50%  of the herd. Alternatively,  where  AI cannot  
be used,  heterosis  can be maintained  by rotational  use of a different  breed  each  
time the bull is replaced.
CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS
1. The National  Cattle  Breeding  Authority  should  be established  and func­
tioning  as quickly  as possible.  On-farm  recording  followed  by performance  
and progeny  testing  of the commercially  important  beef breeds  should  be 
expanded  in a rigidly  integrated  breeding  programme.  Superior  bulls must  
be used to produce  the next generation  of breeding  stock  and inferior  bulls  
must  not be used for breeding.
2. Because  of the small pedigree  herd size and the lack of genetic  linkages  
between  herds, it will not be possible  to produce  EBVs  for all pedigree  
bulls.  Nevertheless  provided  the level  of accuracy  is reasonable,  EBVs  should 
be produced  for as many  pedigree  bulls as possible.  This would  facilitate  
producers  who are not using  AI to identify  and purchase  genetically  supe ­
rior bulls. As is currently  the case in Britain,  EBVs  would  increasingly  
determine  the price  of pedigree  bulls which  in turn would  lead to breeding  
programmes  in pedigree  herds designed  to improve  EBVs.  Thus the gen­
eration  of EBVs  would itself  act as a catalyst  for increased  genetic  progress.
3. Every  effort  must  be made  to ensure  that the current  and future  cattle  iden­
tification  systems  are used  in such  a way as to contribute  to genetic  progress.  
With accurate  and reliable  records,  at least a proportion  of commercial  
animals  could contribute  genetic  information.  A huge source  of potential  
genetic improvement  will be wasted  if the data from commercial  cattle  
cannot  be used.
4. The international  trade in semen  (and also in embryos  and breeding  stock)  
has contributed  enormously  to the genetic  improvement  of dairy  cattle,  par­
ticularly  in Ireland.  While  similar  progress  is not possible  in beef  (because  
of the multiplicity  of breeds,  absence  of genetic  linkages  between  countries  
etc.), nevertheless  the Irish beef industry  would  benefit  greatly  if it could  
avail  of semen  from  the genetically superior  animals  being  identified  through 
much larger  and more sophisticated  breeding  programmes  abroad.  This 
would  require  the testing  of bulls in a number  of different  countries  using  
internationally  agreed  and uniform  evaluation  criteria.  From this conver ­
sion formula  could  be derived  which  would  allow  the conversion  of breed ­
46
6.ing values  from one country  to another.  This would  permit  objective  com­
parisons  of bull ratings  across  countries.
There  are large genetic  differences  both between  and within  breeds.  The 
between  breed  differences  have been widely  recognised  and exploited  by 
producers  but the within  breed  differences  have  not. This should  be the next  
area  of progress.  Genetically  superior  bulls  of all breeds  are available  through  
AI and it will be possible  to identify  genetically  superior  bulls for natural  
service  when  EBVs  are produced.  Producers  must  become  more aware  of 
the genetic  differences  between  animals  and ways  must  be sought  of pass­
ing on the information  on genetic  merit from calf to weanling  to store to 
finishing  producer.  This  would  facilitate  pricing  on the basis  of genetic  merit.
There  should  be a definite  replacement  policy  in suckler  herds. Replace ­
ments may come from outside  the herd as beef x dairy heifers  or as 
specially  bred beef  x beef  heifers. Where  replacements  are produced  within  
the herd they should  have  heterosis,  good milking  ability  and be of moder ­
ate size. This can be achieved  by criss-crossing  40%-50%  of the herd with 
selected  AI bulls  of appropriate  breeds.  The remainder  of the herd  should  be 
bred to a terminal  sire breed  to maximise  beef output  and carcass  quality. 
Where  AI cannot  be used rotating  the breed of bull can go some way 
towards  ensuring  heterosis  and some other desirable  attributes  in the re­
placement  heifers.

Industry

1. Introduction
The  Australian  red meat  industry  commenced  in January  1788,  when the two 
Africander  bulls,  six cows and 44 fat-tailed  sheep  imported  from the Cape  of 
Good  Hope  by Governor  Phillip  arrived  in Sydney.  History  records  that five 
months  after the landing,  only one sheep was alive and all of the cattle had 
strayed  when  their  convict  keeper  fell asleep!  Surprisingly  the lost cattle  were  
recovered  seven years later, when it was found  that they had multiplied  to a 
herd of 60.
From this very modest  beginning,  livestock  numbers  in Australia  have  
increased  to 26.2 million  cattle, including  2.8 million  dairy cattle, and 121 
million  sheep,  producing  beef  and sheep  meat  worth  almost  $5 billion  annually. 
(In August  1996,  an Australian  dollar  was equivalent  to 0.49 Irish punts).  Beef  
exports  alone are worth  $2.85 billion  per year. Although  not the largest  pro­
ducer,  Australia  is now the largest  net exporter  of beef in the world  and the 
second  largest  exporter  of sheep  meat.
Sheep  in Australia  are kept  primarily  for wool  production,  and of the 730,000  
tonnes  of wool (greasy)  produced  annually,  65% is exported  for a return  of 
some $4 billion.  Sheep  numbers  are currently  the lowest  for almost  50 years  
because  of the depressed  world  wool market.  The prime  lamb  industry  is virtu ­
ally a ‘by-product ’ of the wool industry,  and is based  on ‘first-cross ’ ewes  (Bor ­
der Leicester  x Merino)  mated  to a terminal  sire breed,  usually  Dorset  or Poll 
Dorset.  In 1995, lamb and mutton  production  in Australia  was valued  at $833 
million.

Australia  is a large country  with a land area similar  to that of north  America,  
but vast areas of the continent  are unproductive  due to inadequate  rainfall  or 
low soil fertility.  Livestock  are produced  in production  environments  ranging  
from the tropical  summer  rainfall  areas  of northern  Australia  to the temperate,  
winter  rainfall  zone of southern  Australia.  Livestock  producers  receive  no 
government  subsidies,  and must  contend  with the effects  of climatic  and envi­
48
ronmental  extremes.  Various  forms  of government  assistance  in times  of drought,  
bushfire  and flood  are rapidly  being  phased  out
With a population  of only 19 million  people,  Australia  is heavily  dependant  
on exports,  and livestock  producers  are also exposed  to the vagaries  of world  
markets.  The beef industry  is currently  suffering  a serious  downturn  due to 
depressed  prices  on the Japanese  market.  This has occurred  primarily  in re­
sponse  to massive  over-production  in the United  States,  resulting  in intense  
competition  with  Australia  for market  share.  Problems  have been exacerbated  
by the strength  of the $A, high grain  prices  in Australia  and reduced  beef  con­
sumption  generally  associated  with the British  ‘mad cow disease ’ scare.
Almost  half  of the national  cattle  herd,  but very few sheep,  are now run in the 
tropical  and subtropical  regions  of northern  Australia.  Over  the past 20 years.  
Bos indicus  breeds  of cattle  have largely  replaced  British  breeds  in these re­
gions  because  of their  heat  tolerance,  tick resistance  and capacity  to utilise  low 
quality  roughage.  The beef industry  in northern  Australia  is characterised  by 
large herds (1,000  breeding  cows is considered  necessary  for a viable  family  
operation)  extensively  managed  on very large properties  (2,000  to 100,000  ha 
or more,  depending  on location).  Historically  these  herds  have produced  large  
quantities  of low grade  manufacturing  beef  for the American  Hamburger  trade.  
Over  the past decade  however,  both herd productivity  and product  quality  has 
been increased  significantly  as the result  of improved  breeding  and manage ­
ment,  and improved  pastures.
With a temperate  climate  and more reliable  rainfall,  conditions  in southern  
Australia  are more favourable  for high quality  pasture  production,  and live­
stock are managed  more intensively  on smaller  properties  (around  500 ha). 
Beef  cattle  are usually  run as a sideline  to a sheep  or cropping  enterprise,  and 
the average  herd size is about 134 head.  British  and European  beef  breeds  and 
their  crosses  predominate,  and are used  to produce  high  quality  pasture  fed beef 
and as a source  of feeder  cattle for feedlots  throughout  Australia.  Perennial  
ryegrass  and white  clover  pastures  are grown  in the higher  rainfall  areas,  but 
much  of southern  Australia  has been sown  to phalaris,  cocksfoot  and subterra ­
nean clover.  Pasture  productivity  is currently  well below  potential.
As the production  environment  and nature  of the beef industry  in northern  
Australia  bears little resemblance  to that in southern  Australia,  and is far less 
relevant  to the situation  in Ireland,  most  of the technical  information  presented  
in this paper  relates  to the beef  industry  in southern  Australia.
2. Structure  of the Australian  Beef  Industry  
Planning,  Policy  Setting  and  Industry  Development
The Commonwealth  Government ’s Meat  and Livestock  Industry  Act (1995)  
established  the Australian  Meat  Industry  Council  (MIC)  to:
• develop  the vision  and strategic  direction  for the industry
• formulate  broad  industry  policy  (particularly  across  sectors)
• approve  strategic  plans  for meat marketing,  promotion  and R&D
• set the funding  levels  for industry  activity
49
• evaluate  the performance  of industry
• develop  directions  for industry  self regulation
• resolve  issues  which  run across  industry  sectors
The MIC  board  is comprised  of 17 members  representing  all major  sectors  of 
the industry,  including  cattle  and sheep  producers,  feedlotters,  export  and do­
mestic  abattoir  operators,  retailers  (butchers  and supermarkets),  the federal  gov­
ernment  and the meat industry  employees  union.  A ‘Meat Industry  Strategic  
Plan ’ developed  by the MIC  earlier  this year  will be implemented  mainly  through  
the activities  of the Australian  Meat  and Livestock  Corporation  (AMLC)  and 
the Meat  Research  Corporation  (MRC). The  AMLC  is responsible  for the mar­
keting  and promotion  of meat  both  on the domestic  and export  markets,  and the 
MRC  establishes  priorities  and manages  the funding  of research  and develop ­
ment  (R&D).  The MRC  is currently  finalising  its Corporate  Plan comprised  of 
17 ‘Key programs ’ designed  to address  the issues  identified  in the Meat  Indus ­
try Strategic  Plan.
Figure  1: Agencies  Responsible  for Meat  Industry  Development.
Meat industry  R&D in Australia  is funded  by levies  on livestock  producers  
and meat processors,  matched  by an equal contribution  from the Common ­
wealth  Government.  Last year the MRC managed  a budget  of some $51 
million.
Over  the past decade,  a more  systematic  and thorough  approach  to planning  
R&D has been adopted  by the meat industry.  In 1986 the MRC  implemented  
the first of a series of ‘Five Year Plans ’ designed  to maximise  returns  to the 
industry  investment  in R&D.  Prior  to the completion  of the first plan, a com­
prehensive  ‘Research  and Development  Investment  Study ’ was conducted  as 
the basis for the second  ‘ Five Year Plan’ , which commenced  in 1991. An 
on-going  industry  auditing  process  is now being considered  as a means  of 
benchmarking  progress  and identifying  industry  strengths,  weaknesses  and 
opportunities.
All levy payers  now have an opportunity  to contribute  to industry  planning  
and the identification  of R&D  priorities  through  the various  organisations  rep­
resented  on the MIC board,  and through  MRC  advisory  committees.  The MIC
50
and the MRC use a range  of techniques  to assess  opportunities  and industry  
R&D  needs.  Consultants  and market  analysts  are engaged  to conduct  interna ­
tional  benchmarking  studies  and to collect  and analyse  data from around  the 
world.  Staff  are sent overseas  on ‘fact finding  missions ’ and to identify  new 
technology  which  may have application  in Australia.  Extensive  consultation  
with industry  occurs  at a variety  of levels,  from the ‘Annual  General  Meeting ’ 
through  to workshops  and seminars  on specific  subjects  and invited  submis ­
sions.  All new R&D  project  proposals  are subjected  to a rigorous  benefit-cost  
analysis  and scrutiny  by industry  through  ‘Technology  Transfer  Advisory  
Groups ’, prior  to funding.
In the past, the MRC  has invited  research  organisations  to submit  R&D  pro­
posals  for their  consideration  on an annual basis, and  a significant  proportion  of 
the total MRC  budget  has been allocated  to these  submitted  projects.  Although  
this practice  continues,  the emphasis  now is on commissioned  R&D that 
addresses  industry  priorities  identified  in the strategic  plan. This year for 
example,  only 2% of the budget  ($ 1 million)  will be available  for submitted  
projects.
Production  Sector
Most  beef  in Australia  is produced  from  cows kept exclusively  for beef  pro­
duction.  The majority  of the calves  born to the nation ’s 2.8 million  dairy  cows,  
that are surplus  to dairy  industry  requirements,  are slaughtered  for veal produc ­
tion at less than 2 weeks  of age. A very  small ‘pink veal ’ production  system  in 
which  dairy/beef  calves  are artificially  reared  and lot fed for 20 weeks  before  
slaughter  and export  to Europe,  is struggling  to become  established  in the face 
of high production  costs.
Australia  has vast tracts  of land suitable  only for grazing,  and the meat  indus ­
try has therefore  always  been pasture  based.  In southern  Australia,  the cost of 
pasture  dry matter  production  is in the vicinity  of $25/tonne,  whereas  in recent  
years, the cost of feedlot  rations  has varied  from $130 to $220/tonne  of dry 
matter.
Despite  this, Australia  has had a small  feedlot  industry  since  the late 1960s,  
located  mainly  in northern  Australia.  In response  to the increased  demand  for 
grain-fed  beef since the liberalisation  of the Japanese  market  in 1988, the in­
dustry  has grown  rapidly  to the current  capacity  of 825,000  head. Last year, 
82% of cattle  in feedlots  were  fed for the Japanese  or other  export  markets,  but 
the demand  for grain-fed  beef  on the domestic  market,  particularly  for use by 
the hotel restaurant  trade,  is also expected  to grow.
In formulating  feedlot  rations,  the aim is to maximise  feed intake and 
liveweight  gains,  and to minimise  health  problems  and digestive  upsets,  at the 
least possible  cost. Key ingredients  are:
• Roughage  or fibre, which  is required  to maintain  normal  rumen  function.  
This requirement  conflicts  with the need to maximise  the grain component  of 
the diet to achieve  high growth  potential,  but the risk of acidosis  and severe  
digestive  upsets  is greatly  increased  when the proportion  of roughage  in the 
diet is less than 20%.
51
• Energy,  which  determines  growth  rate. For rapid growth,  steers  under 12 
months  of age need a ration  containing  12 megajoules  (MJ) of metabolisable  
energy  (ME)  per kilogram  of dry matter,  and yearling  cattle  need 11 MJ/kg.
• Protein  is essential  for growth,  and to maintain  health  and appetite.  Young  
cattle  need  more  protein  than  older  cattle,  and feedlot  rations  contain  11 to 15% 
crude  protein,  depending  on the age and weight  of cattle  being  fed.
• Minerals  are required  to maintain  feed intake,  health  and feed conversion  
efficiency.  The ratio of calcium  to phosphorous  is particularly  important  for 
feedlot  cattle,  as grain contains  high levels  of phosphorous  but low levels  of 
calcium.  Extra  calcium  is therefore  included  by adding  agricultural  limestone  
to the ration  at the rate of 1%. Depending  on the amount  of protein  in the diet, 
extra  sulphur  may also be required,  and salt is normally  included  at the rate of 
0.5 to 1% to provide  sodium,  stimulate  appetites  and reduce  urinary  problems.
• Trace  minerals  are necessary  for enzyme  function,  protein  transport,  blood  
composition  and for the action  of rumen microbes  and vitamin  synthesis.  These  
are normally  provided  by using  commercially  available  ‘premix  .
• Vitamins  are also essential  to maintain  the health  of feedlot  cattle,  which  
have a daily requirement  for the three fat soluble  vitamins  A, D and E. These  
are also provided  in a commercial  ‘premix ’.
Feedlot  rations  in northern  Australia  are based  on sorghum,  barley,  maize  
(silage  and grain),  cottonseed  meal and lupins,  whereas  in southern  Australia,  
wheat,  barley,  triticale,  lupins  and peas are the main ingredients.  Rations  are 
commonly  comprised  of up to 80% processed  grain,  15 to 20%  roughage  and a 
‘premix ’ of minerals,  vitamins  and ionophores  and buffers to reduce  the risk of 
acidosis.  The feedlot  industry  currently  competes  with the  milling  and brewing  
industries  for wheat  and barley  and there is considerable  interest  in the estab ­
lishment  of a stock feed industry  based  on new high yielding  varieties  of red 
wheat.
Because  of their superior  carcase  characteristics  and greater  propensity  to 
produce  marbled  meat, the feedlot  industry  has a clear preference  for British  
beef  breeds  (particularly  Angus  and Shorthorn)  and Murray  Greys  (a compos ­
ite breed  developed  in Australia  from  Angus  and white  Shorthorns)  in meeting  
the stringent  quality  requirements  of the Japanese  grain fed beef market.  The 
potential  to increase  growth  rate and carcase  yield  by using European  breeds  is 
now widely  recognised  however,  and European  by British  cross-bred  cattle  are 
commonly  fed for markets  where  marbling  is not required  (such  as the domes ­
tic and Korean  markets).
In southern  Australia,  beef  calves  are typically  weaned  at 8-11 months  of age 
and 240 to 300 kg liveweight.  Depending  mainly on breed, fatness  and seasonal  
and marketing  conditions,  these  calves  may then be:
• slaughtered  immediately  for the domestic  supermarket  trade
• transferred  to a feedlot  and fed for the domestic  market
• grown out and finished  at heavier  weights on pasture  for either  domestic  or 
export  markets
52
• grown  out at pasture  to a heavier  feedlot  entry weight  (typically  450-500  
kg) prior  to feeding  for export  markets.
Approximately  60% of slaughter  cattle in southern  Australia  are still sold 
through  saleyards, normally by liveweight  auction  after  pre-sale  weighing.  Sale- 
yard throughputs  are declining  however,  in favour  of modern,  more objective  
direct  marketing  systems,  including  various  forms  of ‘over the hooks ’ selling.  
This trend  is expected  to continue  as more  producers  recognise  the potential  to 
improve  their returns  by breeding  and managing  cattle to accurately  meet  
market  specifications,  and then using  marketing  systems  in which  price is de­
termined  by objective  assessment  of carcase  weight  and quality.
A similar  trend is evident  in the marketing  of store  cattle  and feeder  steers.  At 
present,  over half  of these  cattle  are sold by auction  through  saleyards,  and the 
majority  are not weighed  but simply sold  on a per head basis. However,  changes  
to store cattle marketing  are being  driven  by feedlot  managers,  who are now 
well aware  of very large differences  in performance  between  lines of cattle  
from different  properties.  Feedlots  are now showing  a clear  preference  for pur­
chasing  cattle  direct  from  farms,  and particularly  from producers  who are able 
to supply  reliable  information  about the genetic  potential  and health  of their  
cattle.
The declining  role of saleyards  in the marketing  of both slaughter  and store  
cattle  is also related  to the higher  cost of saleyard  selling,  the stress  associated  
with  the extra  transport  and handling  of stock  through  saleyards,  and the inabil ­
ity of saleyards  to provide  ‘feedback ’ to producers  on the true quality  of their  
cattle.
Farmers  throughout  Australia  face rising  costs, record  levels of farm debt 
and declining  terms of trade. Last year and before  the current  downturn,  the 
Australian  Bureau  of Agricultural  Resource  Economics  reported  that over  the 3 
years to 1995, 71% of beef enterprises  in Australia  were not profitable.  Other  
studies  have demonstrated  enormous  differences  in profitability  between  beef 
herds  operating  in similar  production  environments  (-$29 to $296 per hectare  
in southern  Australia),  with larger  herds and improved  management  practices  
being associated  with greater  profitability.  There is evidence  to suggest  that 
herds of less than 200 cows are no longer  viable  in southern  Australia.  Large 
numbers  of producers  have left the industry  in recent  years,  and many  of those  
remaining  now rely on off farm income  to survive.  Further  ‘rural adjustment ’ is 
inevitable.
In southern  Australia,  ‘livestock  equivalent ’ systems  are used to compare  the 
feed requirements  of different  classes  of stock,  and livestock  enterprises  in dif­
ferent  production  environments.  The ‘Dry Sheep  Equivalent ’ (DSE)  system  is 
widely  accepted,  where  a ‘dry sheep ’ is a non-pregnant  and nonlactating  two 
year old sheep weighing  45 kg and maintaining  its present  weight.  Thus for 
example,  a dry cow weighing  500 kg is rated at 7 DSE, while the same cow 
lactating  and with a 3 month  old calf at foot is rated at 15 DSE.  Average  heef 
cattle  production  costs  per DSE  in southern  Australia  are shown  in Table  2, and 
average  prices  received  for cattle  and gross  margins  are shown  in Table  3.
53
Processing  and Wholesale  Sector
There  are 111 export  abattoirs  in Australia,  and approximately  140 abattoirs  
producing  solely  for the domestic  market  (domestic  abattoirs).
The export  processing  sector  throughout  Australia  is regulated  by the Aus­
tralian  Quarantine  and Inspection  Service  (AQIS)7  which  is responsible  for

monitoring  food safety and hygiene  standards.  AUS-MEAT,  the national  
authority  for the uniform  specification  of meat, carcases  and livestock,  sets 
standards  for and monitors  product  description  in export  (compulsory)  and do­
mestic  (voluntary)  abattoirs.  Abattoirs  slaughtering  beef cattle for export  are 
required  to meet  different  standards,  depending  on the country  of destination,  
in terms of plant, equipment  and management  practices  in order to maintain  
their  export  registration.  Export  abattoirs  normally  operate  as exporters,  and as 
such, must obtain licences  and entitlements  from the AMLC  for export  to
54
different  overseas  markets.  Most  export  abattoirs  also supply  meat to the do­
mestic  market.  Domestic  abattoirs  are regulated  by State  Meat  Authorities,  and 
may on a voluntary  basis  become  accredited  under  AUS-MEAT.
All export  and some  domestic  abattoirs  incorporate  their  own boning  rooms.  
In recent  years, with the rapid expansion  of the hospitality  and food service  
industry  and the decline  in the number  of butcher  shops,  there  has been  a move  
towards  centralised  boning. The number  of independent  boning  rooms  has also 
increased.
International  benchmarking  studies  have demonstrated  that processing  costs  
in Australia  are considerably  higher,  and in some  cases,  almost  double  that of 
our major  competitors  (notably  the United  States  and New Zealand).  Australia  
has surplus  processing  capacity  with many  out-dated  and inefficient  plants  still 
in operation  and there is little doubt  that failure  to invest  in modern  plant and 
equipment  is a contributing  factor.  Similarly  the high  cost of the on-line  inspec ­
tion service  contributes  to higher  processing  costs.  The efficiency  of abattoir  
management  is often  questioned,  but high labour  costs  and poor  industrial  rela­
tions has long been a serious  issue. Most abattoirs,  under  pressure  from the 
Australian  meat workers  union,  still work  under  a ‘tally ’ system,  which  effec ­
tively means  that they only operate  for a few hours each day. By contrast,  
abattoirs  in the United  States  and New Zealand  are commonly  working  two 
shifts,  enabling  far more  effective  use of plant  and equipment.
Replacement  of the on-line  inspection  service  provided  by AQIS  with a sys­
tem of industry  self regulation  based  on ‘Hazard  Analysis  and Critical  Control  
Point ’ (HACCP)  and  quality  assurance  principles  is seen as an important  mecha ­
nism  for reducing  the cost of processing  meat  in the future.
Australian  meat processors  have also recognised  the need to adopt brand  
name  marketing,  and many  are now working  to establish  their own brands  on 
both domestic  and export  markets.  Product  brands  are a particularly  important  
component  of marketing  strategies  in Japan,  and individual  meat  company  brands 
are being  used in conjunction  with the already  well accepted  generic  ‘Aussie  
Beef ’ brand.
Retail  Sector
In the past, red meat  in Australia  has been sold mainly  through  an extensive  
network  of butcher  shops, but  in recent  years, the proportion  of meat  sold through  
supermarkets  has increased  to 37% nationally  (up to 70% in some  States).  Com ­
munity  pressure  for extended  trading  hours  and the convenience  of ‘one stop 
shopping ’ at supermarkets  has forced  the closure  of many  butcher  shops,  and 
this trend is expected  to continue.  The reluctance  of many  butchers  to adapt  to 
changing  consumer  requirements  has possibly  also contributed  to the demise  of 
some  butcher  shops.
As indicated  in Figure  2, the per capita  consumption  of red meat  in Australia  
has also declined  over  the past decade,  in favour  of pork  and chicken.  Concerns  
about  the relationship  between  saturated  fat intake  and heart  disease  have been
55
Figure  2: Per capita  consumption  of meat  in Australia  (kg)
1986
partly  responsible,  and the industry  has attempted  to counter  this by actively  
promoting  the virtues  of lean red meat as a healthy  source  of highly  digestible  
protein  and iron. The increased  demand  for ‘convenience ’ foods  and variability  
in the eating  quality  of beef  are also likely  to be contributing  factors.
As in other  developed  countries,  the changing  lifestyle  in Australia  has also 
contributed  to the decline  in red meat consumption,  with important  implica ­
tions for meat retailers.  With almost  70% of Australian  women  now in the 
workforce,  and 58% of two parent  families  having  both parents  working,  there  
has been  a growing  preference  for meals  involving  little  or no preparation.  Money  
spent  on ‘dining  out or fast food ’ has increased  from  22% to 33% of total food 
expenditure  over  the past  decade. Relative  to other  food industries,  the red meat  
industry  has been slow to adapt  to the increased  demand  for ‘oven ready ’ and 
takeaway  food.
3. Markets  for Australian  Beef
Last year, 64.2%  of total Australian  beef and veal production  was exported,  
and the major  destinations  are indicated  in Figure  3. Exports  to the EU ac­
counted  for less than 1% of total production.
Each  market  requires  quite  different  types of beef,  and for each market  desti ­
nation,  a range  of specifications  are required  to meet the needs of different  
segments  of that market.  Thus  the domestic  market,  for example,  has three  main  
sets of specifications  reflecting  the needs  of the local butcher  trade,  the super ­
markets  and the ‘hotel-restaurant ’ trade. Similarly,  the Japanese  market  has at 
least 8 sets of specifications  for grain  and pasture  fed beef
Market  specifications  are expressed  primarily  in terms of carcase  weight  and 
fat depth  at the P8 (rump) site, but for most  markets,  butt shape, fat colour, meat  
colour,  and dentition  specifications  must also be met. Specifications  for the 
very high quality  Japanese  grain fed beef market  also include  marbling  scores  
and minimum  periods  of feeding  a ration  comprised  of at least 70% grain.

tremely  heavy  muscling)  to E (very  poorly  muscled).
The Japanese  grain fed market  also specifies  a marbling  score  of 2 to 3, on a scale of 0 (no 
marbling)  to 6 (very  heavy  marbling).
57
The United  States  and Canada  purchase  predominantly  low grade  manufac ­
turing  beef from Australia,  for which  the only specifications  are for a high 
percentage  (90% or more)  of chemical  lean. General  specifications  for other  
important  markets  are indicated  in Table  4.
Australia  also has a small,  but rapidly  growing,  live cattle  trade. Last year, 
510,000  head of cattle were exported,  mainly  to South  East Asian feedlots.  
Australia  competes  with Ireland  for a share  of the Egyptian  live cattle  market;  
almost  20,000  head were shipped  to that market  from Australia  in 1995.
Asian  markets  for both  beef  and live cattle  are forecast  to continue  expansion  
to the year  2000,  but Australian  exports  are expected  to be restricted  by intense  
competition  from  the United  States  in particular.  Cuts to EU subsidies  and the 
‘foot and mouth  disease ’ status  of South  American  countries  are also likely  to 
impact  on the future  level of Australian  exports.
Specifications  for the various  beef  markets  are ultimately  determined  by the 
end user. Thus,  for example,  supermarkets  in Australia  engage  market  analysts  
to survey  customers  and to carefully  monitor  changes  in consumer  require ­
ments.  As a result,  carcase  weight  specifications  for supermarket  trade cattle  
have increased  from a maximum  of 180 kg to 240 kg, and fat depth  specifica ­
tions have been reduced  by at least 30% over the past 15 years.
4. Developments  Over  the Past Decade
The opening  up of the Japanese  beef market  in 1988 was the catalyst  for 
significant  development  within  the Australian  beef  industry. Until  that time,  the 
United  States  market  for predominantly  low grade  manufacturing  beef  was the  
principal  destination  for Australian  beef  exports.  By contrast,  the Japanese  and 
other  Asian  beef  markets  require  a very large  volume  of high quality  grain  and 
pasture-fed  beef, and this has provided  the incentive  for industry  to improve  
product  quality  and competitiveness.  On-going  financial  pressure  to increase  
farm productivity  and community  concerns  about  food safety,  animal  welfare  
and protection  of the environment  have also stimulated  considerable  change.  
As a consequence  of these  developments  over the past decade,  the Australian  
meat  industry  has commenced  the transition  from a commodity  based  industry  
to a customer  orientated,  sophisticated  and highly  competitive  food industry. 
Much  remains  to be achieved,  but a start has been made.
Feedlot  Industry
Investment  in the rapid  expansion  of the feedlot  industry  has probably  been  
the most tangible  consequence  of the liberalisation  of the Japanese  market.  
Between  1988 and 1994,  the industry  grew at a rate of approximately  15% per 
year, and current  Australian  feedlot  capacity  is 825,000  head in feedlots  rang­
ing in size from  50 to 50,000  head.  With  high  grain  prices  and depressed  returns  
from beef in 1996,  feedlot  utilisation  has fallen  to 56% of capacity.  There  has 
also been a recent  shift in focus  from  the Japanese  market  to the domestic  mar­
ket, where  grain feeding  is seen by some  processors  as a solution  to problems  
with continuity  of supply  of consistently  high quality  beef.
58
National  Product  Description  and Trading  Language
The establishment  of AUS-MEAT  in 1987 is widely  regarded  as one of the 
most  important  initiatives  in the history  of the Australian  meat  industry.  AUS-  
MEAT,  the authority  for the uniform  specification  of meat and livestock,  was 
introduced  to develop  a national  language  for the description  of livestock,  car­
cases and meat, and to facilitate  improved  communication  up and down the 
entire  marketing  chain.  The two way flow of information  between  livestock  
producers  and agents,  processors,  wholesalers,  retailers  and consumers  is a 
central  theme.  Use of the AUS-MEAT  language  is compulsory  in export  but not 
domestic  abattoirs.  Although  it was seen as the imposition  of additional  costs  
and was resisted  by industry  at first, it is now more  widely  accepted  as being  a 
key element  in better  marketing.
Since  its inception, the  AUS-MEAT  language  has evolved  as new  technology  
became  available.  In 1991 for example,  the new ‘chiller  assessment ’ system  
was introduced  for the assessment  of marbling,  meat colour,  fat colour,  the 
measurement  of eye muscle  area and rib fat depth  and the estimation  of lean 
meat yield. Evidence  for the value  of measuring  pH as means  of identifying  
unacceptably  tough  meat  is becoming  available,  and it is likely that this too will 
become  part of the AUS-MEAT  language.  Similarly,  recent  research  in which  
video  imaging  technology  has been successfully  used for the rapid  assessment  
of carcase  quality  and yield could  result  in the further  refinement  of the AUS-  
MEAT  language.
The AUS-MEAT  language  is a description  system,  not a grading  system.  
Australia  does not have a grading  system  as such, although  the matter  is cur­
rently  the subject  of intense  debate  and two grading  systems  are under  develop ­
ment by different  industry  groups.  Until now, industry  policy has been to 
encourage  individual  meat  companies  to use the AUS-MEAT  language  as the 
basis  for their  own product  brands.  However  the alternate  view,  that consumers  
need a simple,  uniform  grading  system  to assist them with purchasing  deci­
sions,  now seems  likely  to prevail.
Livestock  and Meat  Marketing
Consumers  on both  domestic  and export  markets  have  become  more  demand ­
ing in terms of meat quality  requirements,  and as a result, more stringent  
carcase  specifications  have been  imposed.  A major  problem  facing  the Austral ­
ian meat industry  however  is that there has been no effective  mechanism  for 
communicating  these  specifications  to producers.  As a result,  the industry  has 
not been successful  in consistently  meeting  customer  expectations.  The AUS-  
MEAT  language  was introduced  to help resolve  this, but the fundamental  prob ­
lem has been the manner  in which  livestock  are traded.
Detailed  information  on the requirements  of different  markets  and livestock  
and meat  prices  both in Australia  and overseas  is readily  available  to producers  
and people  servicing  the meat industry  in a plethora  of AMLC  publications.  
However,  producers  respond  to clear ‘price signals’ , not marketing  publica ­
tions, and these signals  have not been a feature  of the dominant  marketing  
systems  used in the past.
59
The majority  of slaughter  cattle in southern  Australia  have been sold by 
liveweight  auction,  where  an average  price (cents/kg  liveweight)  is paid for 
each ‘lot’ or group  of animals.  Although  livestock  agents  draft animals  on the 
basis  of similar  weight  and body  condition,  there  is no attempt  to identify  supe ­
rior animals  and price  them  accordingly.  Vendors  receive  no information  about  
their cattle other than the average  liveweight  and the average  price. Having  
received  no clear ‘price signals ’ from the market,  producers  are unable  to 
respond  by altering  their  breeding  or management  systems.
To address  this problem,  the industry  is steadily  moving  to adopt  various  
‘value based trading ’ systems.  Key elements  of these systems  are objective  
measurement  of carcase  weight,  quality  and sometimes  yield,  price  related  to 
this objective  assessment  and the feedback  of information  to the producer.
‘Computer  Aided  Livestock  Marketing ’ (CALM)  was released  to the meat  
industry  in 1987 and incorporates  the principles  of value  based  trading.  In this 
system,  livestock  for sale are assessed  on farm by an accredited  CALM  
assessor,  who prepares  a detailed  description  of the livestock  and makes  this 
available  to potential  buyers  on the CALM  computer  network.  During  the des­
ignated  sale period  each week,  registered  CALM  buyers  throughout  Australia  
can then participate  in a computer  auction’ , using their own personal  
computers  to bid on the various  lots on the basis of the description  provided.  
Vendors  receive  feedback  on actual  carcase  quality  after  their  stock  are slaugh ­
tered.  CALM  now accounts  for around  15% of sheep  and 3% of cattle  sold in 
Australia.
Other  value  based  trading  systems  usually take  the form  of an ‘over  the hooks ’ 
transaction,  with price determined  according  to a ‘quality  grid’ , such as the 
example  provided  in Figure  4. This grid provides  the premiums  and discounts  
in cents  per kg for Yearling (0 dentition)  male  or female  cattle.  The base  price  is 
represented  in the grid as  a zero;  this is adjusted  weekly  and is readily  available  
from  the abattoir.  Conditions  of sale specifying  acceptable  breed  types  and trad­
ing terms  accompany  the quality  grid.

In the southern  Australian  environment  where  approximately  75% of total 
annual  pasture  dry matter  production  occurs  in the 3 spring  months,  continuity  
of supply  of pasture-fed  beef  and lamb  has always  been a problem.  To encour ­
age out of season  production,  over the past 3 years processors  have offered  
forward  contracts  to producers  for the delivery  of both beef  and lamb  to speci ­
fication,  during  months  of under  supply.  These  contracts  enable  producers  to 
‘lock in’ to a satisfactory  price some months  in advance  of delivery,  giving  
them the confidence  to incur  the additional  expense  of ‘out of season ’ feeding  
systems.  Forward  contracts  also  provide  a means  through  which  processors  can 
accurately  communicate  their  requirements  to producers.  Early  experience  with 
forward  contracts  has been extremely  positive.
As a further  means  of improving  the level of communication  and building  
trust between  the various  sectors  of the meat  industry,  the concept  of ‘strategic  
alliances ’ is now starting  to be taken  up. The ‘Festival  Alliance ’ established  in 
southern  Australia  earlier  this year is an example.  In this alliance,  8 producer  
groups  are supplying  beef and lamb to specification  to 4 domestic  abattoirs,  
who are now supplying  branded  beef  and lamb  carcases  to the ‘Festival ’ chain  
of supermarkets,  comprised  of some 82 retail outlets.  Customers  are being  
offered  a ‘200%  guarantee ’ (product  exchanged  and money  refunded  if they are 
not satisfied),  and they are being  actively  encouraged  to provide  feedback  on 
the product.  Retailers  provide  regular  feedback  to processors  on the extent  of 
compliance  with carcase  specifications.  Processors  purchase  livestock  over a 
quality  grid, and producers  receive  detailed  information  about  the quality  and 
price  of their  livestock.  Forward  contracts  with a choice  of 4 pricing  options  are 
being  offered  to producers.  In return  for their  commitment  to the alliance,  pro­
ducers  able to consistently  meet  specifications  have ‘preferred  supplier ’ status,  
and receive  preferential  treatment  when  livestock  are over supplied.
The ultimate  objective  is to develop  marketing  systems  in which  price is 
directly  related  to saleable  meat  yield  and the eating  quality  of meat,  of which  
in Australia,  tenderness  is by far the most important  component.  Recent  re­
search  on the use of video  image  analysis  to predict  the carcase  yield has been 
extremely  promising,  but the accurate  prediction  of tenderness  remains  elusive.  
Extensive  research  on the development  of a ‘tender  tech ’ probe to measure  
tenderness  on the kill floor  has now been abandoned.
Consumer  Perceptions  of Meat  Quality
The meat industry  is confronted  with two major  challenges  in this area.
The first is that the type of uncooked  meat that consumers  select is quite  
different  to the type of meat they prefer  to eat. In response  to messages  from 
health  professionals  about  the potentially  harmful  effect of saturated  fat intake,  
consumers  generally  prefer  to purchase  very lean cuts of meat with no visible  
marbling.  Numerous  studies  have shown  however  that these same consumers  
prefer  to eat meat from fatter animals,  and with at least moderate  levels of 
marbling.
The second  issue is that although  consumers  prefer  to eat beef  over alterna ­
tive meat products,  they do not regard  it as being  reliable  in terms  of consist-
61
ency of eating  quality.  By contrast,  chicken  does have a reputation  for being  
reliable,  and is often  selected  by consumers  who would  otherwise  prefer  to eat 
beef. Overcoming  the unacceptable  variation  in product  quality  for both 
domestic  and export  markets  will be the subject  of a considerable  research  
effort  in future  years.
Breeding  and Genetics
A recently  completed  study  of the performance  of steers fed for the Japanese  
grain-fed  beef  market  has concluded  that a sustained  and co-ordinated  approach  
to improving  feeder  steer genetics  is needed  in Australia.  Almost  5000 steers  
produced  from 371 beef  sires of 6 breeds  and breed  crosses  were  evaluated  in 
terms of feedlot  growth,  carcase  quality  and yield. Significant  breed differ ­
ences were found  in all traits,  but breed  alone was no guarantee  of perform ­
ance.  Within  breeds,  the difference  in commercial  performance  between  the top 
and bottom  5% of individual  steers,  vendor  lines and sire progeny  groups  was 
$270,  $ 130 and $ 120 respectively  when  fed for 200 days .
Breedplan,  a world  class genetic  evaluation  system  based  on ‘Best Linear  
Unbiased  Prediction ’ (BLUP)  technology,  was released  to the industry  in 1985  
and is now the main avenue  for the genetic  improvement  of beef  cattle  in Aus­
tralia  and New  Zealand.  Since  its introduction,  Breedplan  has been expanded  to 
include  the ‘estimated  breeding  values ’ shown  in Table  5.

After a relatively  slow start due mainly  to resistance  to change  within  the 
stud cattle  industry,  Breedplan  is now being  used and actively  promoted  by 13 
breed  societies.  Largely  as a result  of pressure  from commercial  beef  producers  
wanting  reliable  information  on sale bulls, some 1,500  mainly  seedstock  pro­
ducing  herds  are now registered  with Breedplan.  A recent  evaluation  has found 
that herds  using  Breedplan  technology  are producing  calves  up to 10% heavier  
at the same age than they were before  implementing  the genetic  improvement  
program,  giving  a benefit-cost  ratio of 15; 1 .
The potential  to increase  productivity  through  the use of crossbred  females  
(Figure  5) has been well known  for over 20 years,  but prejudice  against  cross ­
bred cattle and concern  about  the complexity  of crossbreeding  programs  has 
inhibited  the rate ot adoption  of this technology.

In recent  years  there has been a steady  increase  in the adoption  of crossbreed ­
ing, as producers  have recognised  the need to increase  productivity  and adjust  
their  breeding  programs  to target  the requirements  of different  markets. In 1994,  
33% of beef cattle in Australia  were crossbred,  and of these, 58% were Bos 
indicus  x Bos taurus  cross in northern  Australia.  Data for southern  Australia  in 
1994 are summarised  in Figure  6.

Approximately  65% of commercial  beef  producers  in southern  Australia  are 
now practising  crossbreeding  with at least some  of their  cattle.
Pasture  Productivity
Over  the past 20 years,  only 3-4%  of pastures  in southern  Australia  have been 
upgraded,  and as a result, many pastures  are dominated  by unproductive  
species  of low nutritional  value.  Research  has highlighted  the need  to focus  on:
• the introduction  of improved  species  such as clovers  and perennial  grasses
• ensuring  a high and balanced  soil fertility  status  (particularly  soil phospho ­
rous level)
• ensuring  that stocking  rates are high enough  to effectively  utilise  the extra  
pasture  produced.
The relatively  high cost of upgrading pastures  (over  $ 150/ha)  combined  with 
the risk of failure  has been a major  barrier  to adoption,  and numerous  demon ­
stration  trials  have  been  established  in recent  years  to help overcome  this. These  
trials have invariably  demonstrated  spectacular  improvements  in productivity,  
with stocking  rates and gross margins/ha  for upgraded  pastures  frequently  
double  those  for ‘typical  pasture’ . There  is little doubt  that for the foreseeable  
future,  the largest  productivity  gains to be made in southern  Australian  beef 
herds  will come  through  upgrading  pastures.

Out of Season  Feeding  Systems
The increased  demand  for high quality  pasture  fed beef for export  markets  
and the requirement  for branded  product  to be available  all year round has 
focused  industry attention  on the related  issues  of continuity  of supply  and con­
sistency  of product  quality.  Forward  contracts  combined  with cost effective  
pasture  based ‘out of season ’ feeding  systems  are seen as the means  by which  
the southern  Australian  beef  industry  can increase  the supply  of suitable  cattle  
during  winter  and early spring.
Historically  hay and to a lesser  extent  grain  have  been  the main supplements  
fed to cattle  at pasture,  but research  conducted  over the past 2 years  has high ­
lighted  the potential  for increased  use of high quality  pasture  silage  (Table  7).

Virginiamycin  is an antibiotic  used to reduce  the risk of acidosis  in cattle  
being fed grain. ‘Rumentek ’ is a feed supplement  containing  high levels  of 
protected  fat and protein.
Food  Safety
Incidents involving  contamination  of meat  with  organochlorines  (dieldrin  and 
DDT), chlorfluazuron  and veterinary  chemicals,  and isolated  but extremely  
serious  cases  involving  microbial  contamination  of meat  around  the world  have  
focused  consumer  attention  on the issue of food safety.
Australia  has had a national  property  registration  and compulsory  tail tag­
ging system  in place  since  the early 1970 ’s when  the Brucellosis  and Tubercu ­
losis Eradication  Campaign  began.  Both brucellosis  and TB have since beenAverage No. Carcases Profit

eradicated  from all but a few isolated  properties  in northern  Australia,  but the 
property  identification  and tail tagging  system  has been retained  to facilitate  
the traceback  to property  of origin  of carcases  found  to be contaminated  or 
affected  by disease.  This, combined  with abattoir  monitoring,  enables  the 
Australian  meat  industry  to respond  to breaches  in food safety  issues  that may 
occur.
Cattle  in Australia  commonly  change  ownership  and may be grazed  on a 
number  of properties  between  birth and slaughter,  and the lack of a national  
system  for the permanent  identification  of cattle  is a significant  deficiency  in 
existing  traceback  procedures.  State and federal  governments  have agreed  to 
establish  a national  permanent  cattle  identification  and tracking  system.  Last 
year  consultants  were  engaged  to review  the cost and feasibility  of cattle  iden­
tification  systems  currently  available,  including  electronic  devices,  and to de­
velop  recommendations  in consultation  with  government  and industry.  The con­
sultants  have since  recommended  a dual  tagging  system  in which  cattle  would  
be permanently  identified  by the breeder  with a whole of life ‘birth  tag’ and, in 
addition,  would  be identified  with a temporary  transaction  tag at the time of 
each  sale or dispatch  for slaughter. This  system  is now  being  field  tested  against  
an agreed  set of standards,  including  a retention  rate for permanent  identifica ­
tion of at least 99% over 3 years.  Four identification  methods  are being  tested,  
including  intra-rumen  radio  frequency  capsules,  metal  tags, small  plastic  radio  
frequency  ear tags and medium  sized  radio  frequency  plastic  tags.
At this stage only one market,  the EU, specifies  that beef must not be pro­
duced from animals  treated with hormonal  growth  promotants  (HGP ’s). 
Although  the EU is a very small  market  for Australia,  a declaration  system  for 
the identification  of HGP free cattle,  using special  pink ear or tail tags, was 
introduced  in 1994.  Legislation  controlling  the sale and use of HGP ’s has also, 
been introduced.
In July this year, a voluntary  national  ‘vendor  declaration ’ system  was intro ­
duced,  enabling  producers  to declare  the chemical  residue  status  of their  cattle.  
Meat  processors  have strongly  endorsed  the system  by indicating  that they will 
not compete  for sale lots without  vendor  declarations,  and in the first few weeks  
of operation,  the compliance  rate at saleyards  has been  in excess  of 90%.  Cattle  
without  declarations  have been discounted  by up to $100/head.
Animal  Welfare  and  Environmental  Considerations
In addition  to food safety,  community  concern  about animal  welfare  and 
environmental  issues  has increased  dramatically  over the past decade,  and this 
is now reflected  strongly  in government  policy.
By comparison  with the intensive  livestock  industries  where  issues  such as 
battery  cages for laying  hens and the tethering  of sows have evoked  a strong  
reaction,  the cattle  and sheep  industries  have  generally  not been  targeted  by the 
animal  welfare  lobby.  Both state  and federal  governments have  produced  ‘Codes  
of Practice ’ for the welfare  of sheep  and cattle,  but the only significant  issues  to 
emerge  have been drought  and feedlot  management.  It is no longer  acceptable  
to simply allow livestock  to die due to drought,  and producers  are now 
prosecuted  for failing  to either  provide  adequate  feed and water  for livestock  or 
having  them humanely  destroyed.  The welfare  issues in feedlots  are mud in 
winter,  provision  of shade  in summer  and the identification  and care of sick 
animals.  In practice,  most ‘animal  welfare  cases ’ involving  sheep or cattle
66
occur  on small ‘hobby ’ farms where  absentee  owners  or people  without  ad­
equate  animal  husbandry  skills  are responsible  for the care of animals.
Land  degradation  due to soil erosion  and salinity,  and water  quality  are now 
serious  issues  in Australia,  and government  spending  on addressing  these  prob ­
lems and promoting  sustainable  agricultural  practices  has increased.  Rabbits  
have  been responsible  for massive  environmental  damage  throughout  Australia,  
and it is hoped  that the recently  released  rabbit  calicivirus  will achieve  effective  
biological  control.  In northern  Australia,  overgrazing  by cattle  is a major  cause  
of soil erosion,  and in southern  Australia,  the planting  of deep  rooted  perennial  
pasture  species  and agro-forestry  is being  promoted  to lower  the underground  
water  table  and help to prevent  soil salinity  problems.  Feedlots  are also a sensi ­
tive environmental  issue. State governments  strictly  regulate  the location,  
design  and operation  of feedlots  to prevent  the contamination  of soil and both 
surface  and underground  water  with feedlot  waste,  and to avoid  problems  with 
air pollution  (odour  and dust).
Quality  Assurance
The Australian  meat  and livestock  industry  is now moving  to embrace  a cul­
ture of quality,  with all sectors  now  either  developing  or actually  implementing  
quality  assurance  (QA)  programs.  Many  are ‘Hazard  Analysis  and Critical  Con­
trol Point ’ (HACCP)  based  programs  certified  to the International  Standards  
Organisation  (ISO)  9002 standard.
From an overall  industry  perspective,  food safety is of paramount  impor ­
tance,  and QA is seen  as the foundation  on which  to build  consumer  confidence  
in meat products.  Some  sectors  have also been motivated  by the need to meet  
community  expectations  in relation  to animal  welfare  and protection  of the 
environment,  and to reduce  the cost of government  regulation.
Under  criticism  from the community  in relation  to animal  welfare  and envi­
ronmental  issues,  the Australian  Lot Feeders  Association  (ALFA)  was one of 
the first organisations  to adopt the principles  of self regulation  through  QA, 
largely  to avoid the burden  of government  controls.  The ALFA/AUS-MEAT  
national  ‘Feedlot  Accreditation  Scheme ’ commenced  operating  in August  1995,  
and already  763 feedlots  are accredited.  There  is a requirement  that all grain-  
fed beef  for export  must  be sourced  only from  cattle  fed at accredited  feedlots.
Meat  processors  are also moving  to implement  QA. The potential  to reform  
the regulation  of export  abattoirs  is constrained  by the requirements  of our over­
seas customers,  but the domestic  processing  sector  has begun  to reduce  costs  
by replacing  traditional  on-line  inspection  with QA. In 1993 the Victorian  State  
government  established  the Meat Industry  Act which  provides  for the imple ­
mentation  and auditing  of QA programs  in domestic  abattoirs.  Already  two 
major  domestic  abattoirs  have achieved  ISO 9002  accreditation,  and others  are 
working  towards  this goal.
In 1995, the ‘Cattlecare ’ on-farm  QA program  for beef producers  was 
launched,  and ‘Flockcare ’ is currently  under  development  for sheep  meat  pro­
ducers.  Cattlecare  currently  incorporates  15 key elements  addressing  the con­
tamination  of beef with chemical  residues,  carcase  bruising  and hide damage,  
but the program  will be developed  further  to include  other  aspects  of quality. 
Producer  organisations  are now moving  to provide  ISO 9002 certified  third 
party auditing  services  for participating  beef  producers.
The ‘Q Award ’, a HACCP  based and externally  audited  QA program  for 
retail butchers,  was launched  in May this year. The program  includes  advanced
67
product  handling  techniques,  a systematic  approach  to hygiene  and food safety  
and improved  methods  for product  display.
Other  sectors  of the industry,  including  livestock  transporters  and saleyard  
operators,  are also beginning  to develop  QA programs.
5. Future  Challenges  Facing  the Australian  Meat  Industry
By comparison  with their counterparts  in many other  countries,  Australian  
beef  and lamb  producers  operate  in an  open  market,  without  government  subsi ­
dies. Their  products  must compete  not only on international  markets  with red 
meat  produced  in other  countries,  but also with alternative  sources  of food pro­
tein, particularly  pork and chicken  meat.  To remain  viable  in this environment,  
the industry  must meet  consumer  expectations  in terms  of food safety,  quality  
and consistency,  and at a competitive  price.  Further  structural  change  will also 
occur,  with a move  to fewer  but larger  and more  efficient  livestock  enterprises  
and processing  facilities^
The ‘Meat Industry  Strategic  Plan ’ released  by the Meat Industry  Council  
this year  recognises  that despite  past success,  the profitability  and competitive ­
ness of the meat  industry  are currently  not at acceptable  levels,  and that further  
change  is urgently  required.  Future  prosperity  depends  on the industry  ‘doing  
things  better  and differently’ , and the plan identifies  strategic  directions  and 
actions  for achieving  this to the year 2001.
The overall  aim of the Meat  Industry  Strategic  Plan is to ‘increase  industry  
competitiveness  and profitability  in a sustainable  way’, and to achieve  this, six 
strategic  imperatives  have  been identified.  These  are:
1. Achieve  ‘best in class ’ marketing
To achieve  food industry  ‘best in class ’ performance  from enterprise  and 
industry  marketing  and access  activities.
2. Guarantee  eating  quality
To guarantee  palatability  to domestic  consumers  of beef  and lamb.
3. Guarantee  food safety
To guarantee  food safety  through  a ‘plate to paddock ’ quality  assurance  
system.  ^
4. More  consistent  supply
To achieve  a consistent  (quality  and volume)  and predictable  supply of prod ­
uct that meets customer  specifications  at all stages  of the production  and 
marketing  chain.
5. Facilitate  structural  change
To facilitate  rationalisation  and development  of alliances  that will achieve  
the optimal  industry  structure  for international  competitiveness.
6. Improve  leadership  and management
To achieve  leadership  in innovation  and cost efficiency  through  improved  
management,  training  and a culture  of partnership  within  enterprises  and be­
tween  industry  sectors.
Rapid  and substantia!  progress  in all six areas will be required  for a signifi ­
cant impact  on profitability,  and the Meat  Research  Corporation  is now devel ­
oping  a comprehensive  R&D  plan comprised  of 17 key programs  to address  all 
elements  of the Meat  Industry  Strategic  Plan.

Options  for Cattle  Farmers
Tony Pettit,  Cattle  Specialist,  Teagasc  
Tom Egan,  Cattle  Specialist,  Teagasc
The current  beef crisis will force many producers  to examine  their cattle  
enterprise  and assess  their  options.  The major  challenge  facing  producers  is to;
• maintain  a viable  stable  income  as best they can
• avoid  significant  deterioration  in overall  farm finances
This paper  highlights  some  of the key issues  a producer  should  consider  and 
what  advice  Teagasc  might  give. The main points  addressed  are;
1. Lower  versus  higher  stocking  rate systems
2. Importance  of farm efficiency
3. Which  cattle  system
4. Borrowing  capacity
5. Overall  viability
ASSUMPTIONS
• The producer  is already  operating  a relatively  intensive  system
• Adequate  housing  and facilities  are available
• Costs,  output  and performance  levels  are generally  based  on the excellent  
level  of efficiency  in the Teagasc Management  Data  for Farm  Planning  1996
• Premium  rates are at 1996 levels.  It is assumed  that the Deseasonalisation  
Premium  will be available  for the immediate  future.
1. LOWER  VERSUS  HIGHER  STOCKING  RATES
What  are the merits  of higher  stocking  versus  lower  stocking  rate systems?  
This decision  is primarily  dependent  on individual  farm circumstances.  In this 
paper  the relative  profitability  of lower  versus  higher  stocking  rate is compared  
for a 40 ha. farm. It is assumed  that the farmer  is already  operating  a high 
stocking  rate system  and adequate  buildings  and facilities  already  exist for 
either  option.
The lower  and higher  stocking  rate systems  are classified  as follows;
Lower  Stocking  Rate:
• Physical  stocking  rate approximately  1.66 LU per ha. (1.5 ac./LU)
• EU stocking  density  less than 1.4 LU per ha.
• Eligible  for maximum  REPS  payment
• Eligible  for basic EU (Suckler  cow and Special  Beef) Premiums  and 
Extensification  and Deseasonalisation  Premiums
Higher  Stocking  Rate:
• Physical  stocking  rate approximately  2.5 LU per ha. (1 acre/LU)
• EU stocking  density  2.0 LU/ha.  maximum
• Eligible  for basic  EU Premiums  and Deseasonalisation  Premiums
• Not eligible  for Extensification  Premium  or REPS  payments
69
Two systems  of cattle  production  (Suckler  to Beef  and a non breeding  system  - 
Weanling  to Beef)  were compared  using  these  criteria.  Full details  are given  in 
Appendix  1 and 2. A summary  table is presented  below.

The higher  stocking  rate systems  are dependent  on a high beef price  to 
maximise  income.  With the lower  stocking  rate systems  maximising  support  
payments  (Premiums  and REPS)  is crucial.
In a low beef  price  environment  the lower  stocking  rate systems  have  signifi ­
cant advantages  such as;
• Greater  income  stability  (in the short  term at least)  if a higher  proportion  of 
income  comes  from support  payments.
• Reducing  stock  numbers  may facilitate  a reduction  in borrowings.
• Reducing  winter  feed costs,  grazing  costs  and maximising  individual  animal  
performance  at grass.
• Lower  stocking  rate systems  are also more  environmentally  friendly.
Disadvantages  include:
• If implemented,  proposed  changes  in the Extensification  Premium  Stocking  
density  levels  will adversely  affect  the lower  stocking  rate option.
• For larger  farms  the capping  of REPS  payment  at 40 ha dilutes  the overall  
REPS  income  benefit  per hectare.
• Participation  in REPS  involves  commitment  to a five year plan.
• Tax implications  of destocking  must  be considered.
• Longterm  implications  of very heavy  reliance  on support  payments.
Comment
Beef  prices  are likely to remain  depressed  for the forseeable  future.  It is clear  
that even intensive  cattle  farmers  must  assess  the income  implications  of lower  
stocking  versus  higher  stocking  rate systems.  The merits  of either  option  will 
be unique  to each farm situation  and cattle system.  In practice  farmers  may 
meet  REPS  and Extensfication  Premium  requirements with less change in stock ­
ing levels  than shown  here, depending  on the ratio of overall  area owned  to 
adjusted  area farmed.
Note: Lower  stocking  rate levels do not and should  not imply a general  
lowering  of efficiency  standards.  Key efficiency  factors  (e.g. cow productivity,
70
animal performance,  cost  control)  still apply.  There  is an even greater  challenge  
to utilise  grassland  efficiently.
2. THE IMPORTANCE  OF FARM  EFFICIENCY
Cattle  farmers  face an enormous  challenge  if beef  prices  remain  at their  current  
levels.  Production  costs  equal  or exceed  the current  beef  price  in some  systems.  
(See Table  2.1 )

Scope  for Efficiency  Improvements
The Teagasc BeefMlS  Report  on Suckler  Farms  indicates  that there  is further  
scope  to improve  even on farms  operating  at a good level of efficiency.  See 
Appendix  3 for detailed  breakdown.  A summary  of the main conclusions  is 
given  below.
• fixed  costs are generally  too high
• silage  quality  needs  considerable  improvement
• meal costs  per kg. liveweight  gain are too high  reflecting  a need for increased  
emphasis  on silage  quality  and grassland  management
• calving  spread  is much  too wide
• Calving  interval  and calf mortality  also require  considerable  Improvement  
on some  farms
The two major  components  of efficiency  are:
• level and quality  of output
• cost structure
Increased  Output?
Stocking  rate, animal  performance  and cow productivity  determine  output.
• Intensification  beyond  the basic  EU stocking  density  limits  (2.0 LU per hec­
tare) is not advisable  if substantial  investment  in housing  and livestock  is 
required.
• There  is considerable  scope  to improve  animal  performance  (particularly  at 
grass)  on many cattle  farms.  For intensive  integrated  systems  (calf to beef, 
weanling  to beef, suckler  to beef) a swing  to lighter  carcasses  could reduce  
output  per animal.
• In breeding  herds  cow productivity  remains  a key efficiency  factor  (Calving
71
rate, calving  interval,  compactness  of calving  and calf mortality).  A five per 
cent change  in calving  rate changes  output  per cow by £30 in a suckler  to 
beef  system.
Cost  Structure  
Fixed  Costs
A reduction  in fixed  costs  is difficult  to achieve  in the short  term.  Machinery  
costs are the significant  component  of fixed costs. Teagasc  National  Farm  
Survey  data indicates  machinery  costs  of almost  £100  per ha for certain  catego ­
ries of cattle  farms.(See  table  2.2). Cattle  farmers  will have to critically  assess  
how much  machinery  investment  they can carry.

Variable  Costs
Winter  feed costs are the dominant  variable  costs in most cattle  systems  (See

Factors  to be considered  in reducing  winter  feed costs include:
Silage:
Concentrates:
Extending
Grazing:Ensure  adequate  quantities  of good  quality  silage.  Maximise  
area available  for first cuts. Utilise  animal  slurry  for maxi ­
mum  benefit.  Soil test regularly. Minimise  wastage.  Use cost 
effective  additives  when  required
Use  economic  levels  of concentrates. If the beef  price  is £1.90  
per kg carcase  and concentrate  price is 14p per kg (£140/t)  
then breakeven  response  rate is approx.  13:1 (kg 
concentrate:kg  carcase).  Unless  concentrates  can be purchased  
significantly  cheaper,  the optimum  concentrate  feeding  level  
will be about  3-4.5kg on good silage.  The cost per tonne  of 
concentrates  is very important  and producers  must ensure  
good value.
Extending  the grazing  season  (earlier  spring  turnout  and 
extended  autumn  grazing)  will reduce  winter  feed costs.

Grazing  Costs
The feed  costs  per kg liveweight  gain are substantially  lower  for grazed  grass
relative  to indoor  feeding.  (See  Table  2.5)

• Maximise  weight  gain at grass.  This is the most  important  efficiency  message  for cattle  
producers.

3. WHICH  CATTLE  SYSTEM
Switching  systems  can have major implications  on cashflow,  borrowing  
requirements,  tax liability,  housing  requirements  etc. Radical  changes  need to 
be carefully  scrutinised.  As a broad  guideline  the majority  of producers  should  
pursue  systems  that:
• Provide  a reasonable  income.
• Maximise  support  payments.
• Minimise  risk (see Table  3.1).
• Have  realistic  investment  (buildings  and livestock)  requirements.
• Meet  market  requirements  (carcase  weight,  carcase  quality.  Quality  
Assurance)

Suckler  Systems
Suckler  to beef  systems  comply  with most  of the above  requirements.  In the 
current  climate  suckler  to weanling  or store systems  are more vulnerable  to 
market  forces.  However  a high proportion  of suckler  systems  are located  within  
the Disadvantaged  Areas.  This further  enhances  support  payments  and provides  
a buffer  against  market  forces.  The majority  of cattle  producers  will continue  to 
need a suckler  herd to supply  some  or all of their  raw material.
Long  Term  Trading  Systems
Integrated  systems  (calf  to beef and weanling  to beef) are considerably  less 
risky than short term trading  systems.  They can also maximise  support  pay­
ments.  Autumn  to Autumn  store  to beef  systems  have the  advantage  that buying  
and selling  occurs  at the same time. This lowers  the risk factor.  Autumn  to 
Autumn  systems  are compatible  with existing  EU stocking  density  require ­
ments  for the Extensification  Premium.
Short  Term  Trading  Systems
Both winter  finishing  and summer  grazing  systems  involve  a high degree  of 
price speculation.  This makes  them particularly  vulnerable  to sudden  market  
changes.  It is more  difficult  to maximise  premium  payments  in these  systems.  
As the risk factor is considerably  higher  these systems  are more suited to 
specialised  producers  or particular  situations.

Optimum  Finishing  Age
Premium  considerations  can have a major  influence  on the choice  of finish ­
ing age in an integrated  system.  In a spring  calving  suckler  to beef system  for 
example;
• Finishing  (steers)  at 24 months  of age maximises  10 and 22 month  Special  
Beef  Premium  payments  and the Deseasonalisation  Premium.
• Finishing  at 30 months  increases  the land requirement.  The Deseasonalisation  
Premium  is not available.  The margin  hectare  does  not increase.  The 30 month  
system  is less compatible  with the trend  towards  lighter  carcasses.
• A trend  towards  lighter  carcasses  may encourage  early finishing  systems.  If 
finishing  earlier  than  24 months  of age, the 22 month  Special  Beef  Premium  
and possibly  the Slaughter  Premium  are not collected.  This represents  a loss 
of up to £150  in support  payments.  Bull beef  is most  suited  to early  finishing  
systems.  However,  the market  opportunities  for bull beef  appear  limited.
4 BORROWING  CAPACITY
The scope  for investment  or expansion  is limited.  The majority  of drystock  
farms cannot  carry any significant  level of long term borrowings  (See Table  
4.1).

5. OVERALL  VIABILITY
Viability will be dependent  on many factors including; farm size,  cattle  prices,  
overall  efficiency  level of borrowings  and family  income  requirements  (See 
Table  5.2). Farm  size is a major  determinant  of overall  viability.  Data from the 
Teagasc  1994  National  Farm  Survey  representing  80 - 85,000 farms  with cattle  
(and without  milk) indicates  that:
• 45% are less than 20 ha in size
• 18% are over 50 ha in size
• On 40% of cattle  farms  the holder  or spouse  had an off farm  job. This per­
centage  was considerably  higher  within  certain  categories  of cattle  farming.

Many cattle farmers  must supplement  their farm income  with off farm  
income  to meet overall  income  requirements.  This applies  even at very high 
levels  off efficiency.  At moderate  levels  of efficiency  only the biggest  farms  
can generate  a viable  income.
CONCLUSIONS
1. Stocking  Rate Levels
The major  decline  in beef  prices  favours  “lower  stocking  rate”  systems  which 
maximise  EU support  payments.  Schemes  such as REPS  help stabilise  and 
provide  a guaranteed  income  for the immediate  future. Even  intensive  farm ­
ers must  consider  the “lower  stocking  rate” option  and its implications.
2. Efficiency
High  levels  of efficiency  remain  crucially  important  even  if lower  stocking  
rate systems  are adopted.
The scope to increase  output  on intensive  farms  through  higher  stocking  
levels  is limited.  There  is scope  to improve  animal  performance  particu ­
larly at grass.  In breeding  herds  cow productivity  remains  a key efficiency  
factor.
Eixed  costs  must  be controlled.  Machinery  costs  account  for the major  share  
of overheads  costs.
In many  cattle  systems  winter  feed  costs can account  for over  two thirds  of 
total variable  costs. Cattle  farmers  must adopt practices  which  minimise  
winter  feed costs.
76
The feed costs  per kg liveweight  gain are substantially  lower  at grass  rela­
tive to indoor  feeding.  Maximising  weight  gain at grass is a priority.
3. Cattle  Systems
Suckler  systems  and longer  term  trading systems  maximise  EU support  pay­
ments  and are generally  more  stable.  Short  term trading  systems  involve  the 
most  risk.
A trend  towards  lighter  carcases  will militate  against  long  term  (over  2 years  
of age) production  systems.
4. Borrowing  Capacity
The scope  for investment  or expansion  is limited.  The majority  of drystock  
farms  cannot  carry any significant  level of long term borrowings.
5. Overall  Viability
Many  cattle  farmers  must supplement  their farm income  with off farm in­
come  to reach  a viable  income  level.
