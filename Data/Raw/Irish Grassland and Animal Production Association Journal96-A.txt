Editorial
This issue  of  the Journal  is devoted  to those  papers  presented  
during  the 50th Anniversary  programme  of the Association  in 
1996. This programme  consisted  of three major  conferences  
devoted  to the science  and economics  of dairy, beef  and sheep  
production.  The contents  reflect  the current  widespread  interest  
amongst  members  in grass  production  and utilisation  and in the 
future  development  of cost effective  grass and forage  based  
systems  for ruminant  production.
The publication  of the original  papers  in full in this Journal  
gives members  - researchers,  advisers,  farmers  and students  
alike  - a permanent  and  accessible  record  of  valuable  reference  
material  not only on the science  and economics  of grass and 
ruminant  production  but also on up-to-date  trends  and 
developments  in the context  of  EU  Agricultural  policy  and world  
trade.
We continue  to receive  requests  from libraries  in Canada,  
U.S., New Zealand,  U.K. and Europe,  indicating  overseas  
awareness  of  developments  in grassland  farming  in Ireland  and 
recognising  the role of the Association  in reporting  this  progress.

Irish Farmers'  Journal
Ireland  was designed  for grass  production.  A long  growing  season,  rainfall  
averaging  over three weeks  per month  and a dearth  of summer  droughts  - all 
favour  grass over grain.  Yet, by 1946 we had done little to improve  the grass  
that nature  had provided.  Advances in arable  husbandry  over  the previous  century  
had largely  passed  grassland  by. Yields  of first crop hay from grass seed sown 
after  an arable  rotation  may have been tbe exception.  Three  tons per acre yield  
were recorded  on farms  and no comparative  trials  existed.  This yield level fell 
away rapidly  in subsequent  years  to the low average  grass yield of the period.
In 1946 average  production  from Irish grassland  was estimated  at about 1 
ton dry matter  per acre per annum -12 cow starch  equivalents. Professor  Michael  
Murphy  of UCC had surveyed  dairy farms in North  Cork-East  Limerick,  an 
intensive  dairying  district.  Average  milk yield per acre on specialist  farms  was 
130 gallons.  National  milk production  for creameries  and liquid milk trade  
totalled  220 million  gallons  - our national  E.U. quota  figure  today  is over 1,200  . 
m. gallons. The  New  Zealand  consultant,  George  Holmes, brought  in by Minister  
James Dillon,  found that much Irish grassland  was producing  the minimal  
possible  under  an Irish sky.
With this background,  a group  of enthusiasts  formed  the Irish Grassland  
Association  in 1946.  The group  included  progressive  farmers,  Rob McCulloch,  
North  Dublin,  William  Bland,  Laois,  Harry  Warren,  Wexford,  Edward  R. Orpen, 
Wexford.  There were also academics  and industry  leaders,  including  Henry 
Kennedy,  I.A.O.S.,  Harry  Spain,  Department  of Agriculture,  Michael  Gorman  
and Ned Sheehy,  UCD.  Their  objective  was to identify  all available  knowledge  
on grassland  farming  and to help in its application  to Irish farm practice.  There  
was little or no research  on grass in the South  at the time;  pioneering  work  had 
been initiated  in Northern  Ireland  by Pat Leniban  and John Lowe;  Britain  had 
moved;  progress  was seen  at Aberystwyth  and at  the Grassland  Research  Centre  
which was in Warwickshire  at the time. Progress  by the young  I.G.A. was 
initiated  by identifying  main areas of weakness,  by observing  and measuring  
progress  on good farms and by linking  with the limited  amount  of research  
results  available. Guidance  also came from  progress  in Britain and  the Continent.
Soil fertility  was, perhaps,  the greatest  limitation  on Irish grass  growth.  For 
instance,  early soil tests showed  the general  P level at 1 - we expect  9 today 
for good grass growth.  Clinical  phosphate  deficiency  in cattle  existed.  Potash  
was being  absorbed  in animals  and animal  products  at 18 times  the replacement  
rate. Routine  liming  was little practised  - certainly  not for grassland.  We used 
5,000  tons fertilizer  N - 350,000  today.
An inhospitable  soil means  poor  performing  grass  plants.  Agrostis,  with its 
many  cousins  and family members, was  universal.  They all gave  low production,  
a late start in spring  and poor quality,  if silage  was made.
Better  pasture  had Poa, some  Holcus  and a little  Lolium.  Ryegrass  on reseeded 
grassland  held for a short  duration,  due to low fertility  and a low  grade  ryegrass  
variety.
Conservation  of grass for winter  feed was limited  in quantity  and quality. 
Hay making  in a wet Irish summer  spelt more failure  than success.  Reduced  
quantity  and quality  in a bad year meant  animal  stress.  Emaciated  cows were  
a spring  time norm in dairying  areas. Scientific  starvation  was the term used 
by Henry  Kennedy  at an early IGA meeting.  Sufficient  was fed to sustain  life 
and no more.
In milk production,  cow quality  was a scarce  commodity.  A Department  of 
Agriculture  committee,  untrained  in animal  breeding,  had set out to design.an  
Irish dairy cow. Their  end product  was a giraffe.  Average  yield was about  400 
gallons;  any cow recording  over 600 gallons  received  a special  accolade  and 
was registered  as outstanding.  Progress  in fat and protein  was unknown.
Advances  in the late forties  and early fifties  followed  increased  use of lime 
and fertiliser.  The strong  personality  of General  Costello,  general  manager  of 
the Sugar  Company,  added  an early impetus.  He introduced  ground  limestone  
production  and distribution  with military  detail. During  the Korean  war he 
imported  phosphates  in bulk,  avoided  shortages  and cut costs.  The swing  from  
hay to silage  was helped  by mechanisation.  The buck rake and later the forage  
harvester  became  valuable  tools.
All progressive  dairy farmers  changed  from the low yielding  Shorthorn  to 
Friesian.
In all sectors  of grass farming  the Irish Grassland  Association  provided  
knowledge  and encouragement  through  organised  visits  to pioneering  farmers  
and research  centres  in Northern  Ireland,  Britain  and the continent.  The same  
sources  were  tapped  for specialist  meetings,  particularly  on dairy  development.  
Henry Kennedy  focused  the IGA on New Zealand ’s low cost, high output  
dairying.  A sound philosophy  of performance  without  expensive  frills was 
instilled  into members  of the Association  by visiting  New Zealand  speakers  
that included  McMeekan,  Mac Cooper  and Alan Stewart.
Nearer  home, progressive  farmers  in Northern  Ireland  had shown  the 
possibilities  of high output  with well managed  grass.  In 1950,  Sean O’Neill of 
Lurgan  was carrying  1 cow per acre on high nitrogen  input;  winter  feeding  was 
silage,  no concentrates.  In Co. Antrim,  on indifferent  soil, Sandy  McGuckian  
was producing  5.5 to 6 cwt. liveweight  beef per acre - more than double  the 
best Co. Meath  target  at the time.
In those  years, Irish grassland  research was scarcely  in embryo.  We benefited  
from trial and experience  of farmers  and farm research  elsewhere.  This left 
obvious  gaps and weaknesses.  There was need for measurement  at home.  
Johnstown  Castle  had been established  and was defining  optimum  levels for 
lime and fertiliser  use. A team of bright  and vigorous  research  workers  was 
gathered.  These became  the nucleus  on which  the Agricultural  Institute  was
established  in 1958.  Tom Walsh  became  Director  and he certainly  did not lack 
vigour  or the capacity  to generate  enthusiasm  in his young  staff. The pursuit  
of knowledge  on all sectors  of grass farming  became  the objective.
Roger  McCarrick  took charge  of silage  development;  he sought  to establish  
farm guidance  in an area dominated  by confusion  and perhaps  emotion.  The 
place  of digestibility  in silage  intake  and in animal  performance  was recognised;  
the higher  sugar  content  of ryegrass was linked  to good  fermentation; the adver.se  
effect  of very high  grass  moisture  was identified; acid  additives  were  established  
as a means  of overcoming  problems;  the level of N fertiliser  for best yield was 
determined.  Silage  became  a more consistent  and reliable  winter  feed.
Aidan  Conway  at Grange  established  the stocking  rate level  for high output  
grass beef - 750 lb liveweight  per acre was achieved.
Moorepark  got underway  under  Michael  Walshe  and for the first time Irish 
creamery  milk  production  was given  research  and measurement  back-up.  Despite 
the appalling  low grade  cows  of the time,  Moorepark  went ahead  in identifying  
optimum  stocking  rate and affirmed  the link between  stocking  rate and output  
per farm.  The commercial  level of N fertiliser  use was ascertained  - as well as 
the appropriate  stocking  rate. Under  conditions  of the time clover  was seen as 
a less profitable  source  of N. The research  horizon  widened.  Fundamental  work 
on machine  milking  was undertaken  and principles  of liner design  and those  
of performance  generally  were established.  These  are still with us, reducing  
mastitis  levels,  cell counts  and improving  labour  output.
Moorepark  tackled  the brucellosis  problem  at a time when the official  
eradication  scheme  was wiping  out dairy herds and dairy farmers,  while  
decimating  cow numbers.
Moorepark  showed  that a combination  of vaccination  with a more refined  
reading  of blood tests gave more accurate  results,  with far less slaughter  of 
dairy cows.  The new technique  was adopted  Just before  eradication  started  in 
the main dairy counties.  Kerry was the last to suffer  the cow losses  of the old 
system  and Kerry milk quota  suffers  to this day.
Work  by Dan Browne  of Moorepark  and Willie  Murphy of Johnstown  Castle  
established  the strengths,  weaknesses  and timing  of urea, a cheap  N source.
Willie  Murphy  also identified  the place  of sulphur  - and the need for it on 
many loam soils.
Dairy farmers  have seen Moorepark  buffeted  by administrative  
incompetence.  Yet, its vigour  has survived  and certainly  it retains  the philosophy  
of accurate  work and commitment  to low cost commercial  diary farming,  all 
created  initially  by Michael  Walsh.
As I mentioned  earlier,  progress  in the early  days  of Irish  grass  development  
was linked  to knowledge  transfer  from farmers  and from research  elsewhere.  
All was welcome,  but we also found that precise  measurement  under  conditions  
in Ireland  provided  a more accurate  and better  defined  path forward.  Let us 
search  far and wide for ideas, but let us refine  their application  through  well 
directed  Irish research.
We now look to the next 50 years.  Survival  of commercial  Irish farming  in 
a world ot freer trade will depend  on maintaining  the competitive  advantage
of grass based agriculture.  How much progress  are we making?  What  
development  is there in the pipeline?
In the past half century  our greatest  achievements  were directly  related  to 
maximising  the level of N fertiliser  use and to increased stocking  rates sufficient  
to consume  all grass  grown.  We are now at the limit  of expansion  in both areas.
Where  else do we go?
It is estimated  that the grass  plant is, theoretically,  capable  of producing  25 
tons dry matter  per ha, in our climate.  Yet, it is difficult  to pass 14-15 tons in 
best farming  practice.  What  are the limitations?  Why has our grass  output  been 
near static at this level for decades?
Should  we be satisfied  with the service  provided  by grass breeders?
Is the new technology  of gene manipulation  fully applied  to selection  for 
yield and length  of grazing  season?  Should  we encourage  more collaboration  
between  Irish grass  breeders.  North  and South?  Certainly  the progress  in maize  
breeding  is twice the rate in grass. That alone will have its impact  on 
competitiveness.
I may also suggest  that in screening  new varieties  the selection  progress  has 
bypassed  the animal.  Yield  under  cutting  remains  the sole criterion.  There  must  
be some  place  for animal  assessment.  Even  the most  basic question  of tetraploid  
or diploid  has never been adequately  asked  of the animal.
And then, we have coming  the challenge  to pastures  and grass strains  from 
high merit  cows with large intake  demands.  How do we select  and manage  for 
the grass nutrient  intake  demanded  by such stock?
Grasses  for silage: information  is limited  on varieties  for maximum  dry 
matter  and nutrient  yield,  as well as persistence  under  a two-cut  silage  system.  
Crossnacreevy  in Northern  Ireland shows that very significant  differences  exist.  
What follow-up  has there been?
When  a superior  new cultivar  is identified,  how can it be brought  into the 
farm production  system  with minimal  disturbance  of the growth  pattern?
Sward  management  of both late and early growth  is another  neglected  area. 
Progress  was being  made  by Johnstown,  some  eight  years  ago.  Then,  in another  
one of these weird administration  revolutions  all was stopped  and little has 
happened since.  Early spring  grass is vitally important  in dairying.  Its production  
is linked  to autumn  management.  Precision  and detail  are not fully established;  
they should  be!
In grassland  nutrition,  can we develop  a rapid  soil test for available  N? How  
much added N for maximum  growth  at any particular  period?  Such  a test would  
be particularly  relevant  in autumn,  in a spring  such as 1996 and in periods  of 
drought.
I raise  this range  of questions because  our research  organisations show  limited 
commitment  to our most important  crop.  In no way do I detract from the excellent  
production  work at Moorepark,  but it is necessary  to cast the net wider  in the 
search  for knowledge.  The current  research  budget  for Teagasc  is close to £24 
million.  I doubt if a half per cent of this sum is devoted  to the growing  of a 
crop that covers  over 90 per cent of our farmland.  The growing  of grass merits  
a higher  level of priority.

Introduction
In the early ’60’s there were over 100,000  milk producers  supplying  1,272  
million  litres  to 650 different  creameries.  Today,  we have  43,000  milk suppliers  
supplying  4,718  million  litres to 38 different  creameries.  Behind  these  figures  
lies a story of massive  structural  and technological  changes  on dairy  farms. The  
modern  intensive  dairy farm produces  high volumes  of milk per cow and per 
acre. Grassland  management  has improved  to the extent  that efficient  dairy  
farmers  require  less than an acre of land per cow for a year. Fertilizer  usage  
has increased  dramatically.  The main  Winter  feed is now grass  silage,  the standard 
system  of housing  is the cow cubicle  and dairy herds are milked  in efficient  
milking  parlours.
Ireland ’s accession  to the EEC  in 1973 accelerated  an existing  trend  towards  
growth  in milk  output  and greatly increased  the value  of milk  and dairy  products.  
Milk output  almost  doubled  in the period  of 1970 to 1985. In the years prior  
to the introduction  of milk quota  systems  the annual  growth  in milk output  was 
about  5%. This happened  despite  a 50% reduction in the number  of milk  suppliers  
and Brucellosis  was eradicated  from the national  herd. The EEC milk quota  
allocated  to Ireland  was low compared  to that of more  developed  countries,  e.g. 
Netherlands  (1.07 vs 8.90 tonnes  of milk per forage  acre).
The establishment  of Moorepark  Research  Centre  in 1959  made  an invaluable  
contribution  to the development  of the Irish  dairy  industry  area  over  this period.  
The first experiments  demonstrated  that, with some  nitrogen  for silage,  it was 
possible  to stock cows at 1.2 acres per cow. Over the next 30 to 35 years  
Moorepark  developed  a ‘blueprint ’ for milk  production  from grassland  on many 
soil types.  In the early  years  Moorepark  showed  that the best route  to increased  
farm income  was through  increased  output,  and the most direct method  of 
increasing  output  was to keep more cows on the farm Therefore  the features  
of the system  were high stocking  rates (2.7 to 3.0 cows  per hectare),  rotational  
grazing,  using  nitrogen  to provide  adequate  grass  for grazing  and conservation,  
and compact  Spring  calving.  The ‘Moorepark  Blueprint ’ defined  the farm  
structures  and management  system  needed  for low-cost  intensive  dairying.  
Through  the ’7()’s and ’80’s a series  of important  ‘component ’ experiments  in 
the areas of grassland  management,  silage  quality,  concentrate  feeding  levels,  
infertility,  replacement  heifers,  mastitis,  lameness  and milking  machines  were 
inserted  into the ‘Moorepark  Blueprint ’ and milk yield increased.
The introduction of EEC milk  quotas  in the early  ’80’s switched the challenge  
to producing  the Irish milk quota  as efficiently  as possible.  For the Irish dairy
8
farmer  this implied  making  maximum  use of grazed  grass in the system  since  
it is our cheapest  feed. The emphasis  has shifted  from increased  output  from  
the farm to optimizing  the quota  available.  High margins  from a farm can be 
achieved  by maximizing  the receipts  as well as controlling  costs. Such milk 
production  systems  will need to be sustainable  economically  and in terms  of 
their impact  on the environment  and quality  of life for the farm family.
Target  inputs/outputs  per cow
In dry land situations,  the target  output  from  the system  today  is 5,450  litres  
of milk (1,200  gallons)  per cow with a fat and protein  concentration  of 3.90%  
fat and 3.40%  protein  (Figure  1). This is achieved  at a stocking  rate of 2.80 
cows per ha, nitrogen  input  of 320 kg per ha, and a mean calving  date in late- 
February/early-March.  The input  per cow includes  500 kg of concentrates,  3.3 
tonnes  of grazed grass  and 1.2 tonnes  of silage  DM. Over  half  of the concentrates  
is fed in the Spring/early-Summer  with the remaining  amounts  fed in the  Autumn  
(October  - December).  The silage  requirement  of 6.5 to 7.0 (18-20%  DM) tonnes  
of silage  per cow is adequate  in free-draining  land in the South,  an extra 1 to 
2 tonnes  if required  in more difficult  wetland  situations.
The milk production  profile  is shown  on Figure  1. Therefore,  a total yield  
of 400 kg of fat and protein  per cow (300-day  lactation)  is possible.  The key

elements  in achieving  this output  are the matching  of stocking  rate and nitrogen  
use, targeting  calving  date coupled  with  compact  calving,  the provision  of early  
Spring  grass,  silage  conservation strategy  and requirement,  obtaining  high  intakes 
of high quality  grass,  introduction  of Autumn  supplementation  when  required,  
finishing  grazing  by mid-November  and the use of high genetic  merit  animals  
to convert  the feed efficiently  into milk.
Stocking  rate and nitrogen  input
Increasing  stocking  rate may result  in a small  decline  in herbage  production  
but herbage  utilization  is substantially  increased.  Stocking  rate was shown  to 
be the most powerful  ‘tool ’ influencing  efficiency  on land area basis. In the 
future,  with more precise  control  of grazing  management,  stocking  rate per 
hectare  may not be as important.  Since the introduction  of EEC milk quotas  
and much  higher  genetic  merit  cows,  the requirement  for high stocking  rates  
are not as essential  now. On most dairy farms,  milk quota is generally  more  
limiting  than land area. Therefore  stocking  rate could be lowered  with the 
objective  of increasing  the supply  of grazed  grass  to the dairy  herd.  This would  
be important  in the early Spring  and Autumn  period  (Eigure  2). Two stocking  
rates (2.91 vs 2.60  cows  per ha) were evaluated  over  a three-year  period  (Table 
1). Reducing  the stocking  rate by 0.31 cows per ha increased  milk yield per 
cow by 160 litres on average  over a three-year  period  with little effect  on milk 
composition.  The financial  results  showed  that milk receipts  increased  by £45 
per cow. Variable  costs  were  reduced  by £4 per cow. This resulted  in an increase  
of £49 per cow in gross margin.
The response  to increased  nitrogen  input is usually  measured  in terms of 
increa.sed  stock-carrying  capacity.  There  is general  agreement  that, provided  
stocking  rate is high enough  (2.8 to 3.0 cows  per ha) milk  production  responses  
will be obtained  for the use of levels  of up to 320 kg N/ha. Responses  in herds 
with higher  application  levels  of up to 375 kg N/ha will be dependent  on high

cows per hectare.

In the years ahead with the feasibility  of milk quota  being  abolished,  the 
very high  stocking  rates  that were  obtainable  in the early  ’ 80’s will not be feasible. 
The reason  for this is the rapid  increase  in genetic  merit  and the quest  for higher  
intakes  of higher  quality  grass and grass silage  in our systems.  Since  the late 
’80’s, the concepts  of grass quantity  and achieving  high DM intakes  has 
superseded  the advantages  that are to be obtained  from higher  stocking  rates.  
These  high stocking  rates will only be attainable  if higher  quantities  of other  
feeds are brought  into the system  (farm treated  as a feedlot).
Calving  date and compact  calving
Calving  date and the compactness  of calving  has a large influence  on the 
seasonality  of milk  supply,  on cost  of milk  production  and on fann profit.  Altering  
the calving  date changes  the seasonal  demand  pattern  for feed (Figure  2). The 
results  of an experiment  investigating  the effect  of 2 different  calving  dates  at 
an overall  stocking  rate of 2.91 cows  per ha is shown  in Table  2. Delaying  mean 
calving  date from January  21 to March 15 reduced  milk yield per cow by an 
average  418 L. The reduced  milk yield per cow can be alleviated  by either  
reduced  stocking rate and/or  increased  concentrate  input.  In a later  section (under  
‘Supplementation ’) of this paper,  the periods  of strategic  supplementation  to 
achieve  the higher  milk yields  are identified.  However,  later calving  increased
11
milk fat and protein  concentration.  Concentrates  fed per cow was also reduced  
by 435 kg per cow. Relative  to March,  January  calving  will add £44 per cow 
to costs. January  calving  will reduce  margin  by £23 per cow Therefore  if no 
milk bonus  payments  are available,  calving  date should  be concentrated  just 
prior to the start of the grazing  season.  This will allow up to 80% of milk to 
be produced  from grazed  grass.  A system  of milk production  that is driven  by 
a close  match of calving  date  to grass supply is very much  dependent  on compact  
calving. The target  is 90% of the herd  calving  in a 9-week  period.  This is achieved 
using  AI with good  herd fertility  management.  Tail paint  is used in conjunction  
with three observations  at 7 am, before  evening  milking  and at about  9 pm at 
night. This will result  in an oestrous  detection  rate of approximately  90% of 
the cows  in the herd.  Calving  should  start 4 weeks  prior  to the expected  turnout  
day to grass.  If the expected  turn-out  day is in early March,  then the breeding  
season  should  start in late-February.
Where  turnout  is much  later (early  to mid-April),  the start of the breeding  
season  should  not be delayed  beyond  mid-May.

In order  to achieve  a compact  calving, a precise  breeding programme  requires  
to be set out before  it starts.  An example  of this is shown  as follows:
(1) Start pre-service  heat detection
(2) Scan and treatment  non-cycling  cows
(3) Start AI— March  25
— April 17
— April 24
(4) Scan and treatment  of non-served  cows  — May 22
(5) All cows served  and not showing  heat scanned  at — 30-40  days
(6) AI finish  — July 24.
This enables a dairy  farmer  to have  a controlled  approach to the breeding  season.
Grazing  management  and silage  conservation
Grazing  grass in situ at a reasonable  level of utilization  will remain  the 
simplest  and most  efficient  method  of converting  grass  to milk.  It is also generally  
accepted  in Ireland  that rotational  grazing  is the most practical  and reliable  
method  of utilizing  grass. However,  it is only at high stocking  rates that 
production  increases  are actually  achieved  when compared  to set-stocking.
Efficient  grazing  management  is facilitated  by farm layout,  which  entails  
good  farm roadways  and paddocks  with  an adequate water  supply.  The challenge  
under  Irish  conditions  is to maximise  the amount  grown  (12-14 1 DM/ha)  through  
grazing.  The annual  feed budget  determines  the annual  stocking  rate linked  
with the appropriate  nitrogen  requirement,  as previously  outlined.  The 
intermediate  feed budget  will determine  the date of start of grazing,  when to 
close-up  for silage  and what proportion  of the farm  should  be closed  for silage,  
etc.
Recommendations  from  Moorepark  are that all of the farm  should  be grazed  
initially,  with the initial grazing  starting  in early-March  if grass supply  and 
weather  conditions  permit.  This may  not be possible  in all years  on difficult  wet 
land. Early  grazing  is facilitated  by early nitrogen  application  and the correct  
timing  of final Autumn  defoliation.  However,  due to the low growth  rate in 
early Spring,  grass  supply  will not be adequate  to meet  the dairy  cow ’s demand  
when  first turned  out to grass.  With  compact  Spring  calving  and stocking  rates  
of 2.6 - 3.0 cows per hectare,  daily grass growth  will not be adequate  to meet  
cow demand  until mid- to late-April.  Therefore,  up to that date and depending  
on turnout  date, grazed  grass will only constitute  part of the cow ’s diet. It is 
important  that the first rotation  should  not finish before  mid- to late-April.
The first week of April is proposed  as the key period  for closing  for first 
cut silage.  At a stocking  rate of 2.74 cows per hectare,  45 to 50% of the total 
area can be closed  at this time, resulting  in a stocking  rate of about  5.5 cows  
per ha on the grazing  area. However,  depending  on grass-growing  conditions  
in any one year, this can be increased  or decreased.  A silage  yield of 7 tonnes  
of grass DM per ha is achievable  under  good management.  This will produce  
28 tonnes  per ha of settled  silage  with 20% DM cut in late-May  allowing  for 
20% losses  due to ensiling.  In the grazing  area, tight grazing  to 6 cm during  
this period  (late-April  to end of June) is critical.  Grazing  management  in this 
period  is critical  for the remainder  of the season.  The benefit  of lenient  grazing  
(8-10  cm) during  this period  is small  (68 litres milk per cow).  However, the  loss 
in milk  yield for the remainder  of the season due to deterioration  in sward quality  
is much larger  (410 litres milk per cow). Another  option  is to top pastures  to 
the required  post-grazing  sward  height  (6 cm) during  May and June. This has 
been shown  to be feasible  and this may be an important  strategy  in difficult  
grazing  conditions.  Stocking  rate on the grazing  area is reduced  to 4.50 cows
13
per ha in mid to late-June  as a result  of releasing  of about 10% of total farm 
area for grazing  after first cut silage.
The second  silage  crop is cut 7 to 8 weeks  after the first (10 - 20th July). 
A silage  yield of 4.5 - 5.0 tonnes  of grass  DM per ha is achievable  under  good  
management  to produce  18 tonnes  per ha of settled  silage  with 20% DM. This 
will provide  a total of almost  7 tonnes  of settled  silage  (20% DM) per cow at 
an overall  stocking  rate of 2.80  cows  per ha from the two silage  cuts. From  mid- 
to late-August  onwards, the total farm is available  for grazing. During  the period  
(July to September),  grazing  pressure  may be relaxed  to allow  a post-grazing  
sward  surface  height  of 7-8 cm in order  to increase  milk yield  per cow without  
resulting  in deterioration  in sward  quality  afterwards.
The grass available  in early Spring  is a combination  of the grass carried  
over from the previous  Autumn  plus that which  grew over the Winter.  Results  
from Moorepark  show that delaying  closing  pastures  from late-October  until 
early December  reduced  Spring  yield of grass  by 500 kg DM/ha  for a removal  
of 300 kg in the previous  Autumn.  Therefore,  the loss in yield of grass dry 
matter  at turnout  is not balanced  by the grass harvested  in the late-Autumn  / 
early-Winter  grazing.  It is difficult  to be precise  about the optimum  closing  
date, as it will vary from year to year, depending  on grass-growing  conditions.  
As a general  guide,  in an intensive  Spring-calving  situation,  the last rotation  
should  start in late-October,  with a cessation  of all grazing  by mid-November.
Supplementation
Obtaining  target  milk  production  in Spring and Autumn/early-Winter  period  
depends  on getting  the correct  blend  of grass silage,  grazed  grass and concentrate  
in the diet (Figure  1). There  may be periods  during  the main grazing  season  
where supplementation  may be required,  e.g. reduced  grass supply  in mid­
summer  due to low rainfall  levels.  The level of concentrate  feeding  required  
when  cows are indoors  fulltime,  both before  and after  calving,  depends  on the 
quantity  of silage  available.  It is desirable  to have  cows  in body  condition  score  
of 3.0 to 3.5 at calving  down and it is estimated  that cows in moderate  body 
condition  (2.25 to 2.50) at drying-off  should  be gaining  liveweight  of 0.25 to 
0.75 kg per day. Silage-only  with a dry matter  digestibility  of 70 DMD  will be 
adequate  to support  these requirements.  After calving,  the desired  level of 
concentrate  feeding  is dependent  on milk price to concentrate  cost ratio, the 
quantity  of the silage,  milk quota  and milk yield potential  of the cows.  In a no­
quota restriction,  and good quality  silage  (70% DMD),  with average  genetic  
merit cows and present  milk and concentrate  prices,  it will be economical  to 
feed 7 to 8 kg per day.
The beneficial  effect  of including  grazed  grass in the diet of the dairy cow 
in early lactation  is well recognized.  The results  of two studies  at Moorepark  
(1993 and 1994) where  grass silage  was supplemented  with concentrates  and 
early Spring  grass is shown  in Table 3.
The first group  were indoors  full-time  and on ad-lib  grass  silage  (67 D) plus 
6 kg of concentrates.  The other  three groups  were turned  out to grass,  starting  
on 27th February  in 1993, and 1 Ith March  in 1994. In 1993, the cows were

allowed  to graze by day (9 am to 3 pm) and were given an allowance  of 9.5 
kg DM/cow/day  (> 4 cm). In 1994, the grass allowance  was 14 kg DM/cow/  
day and they were allowed  to graze  by night  (4 pm to 7 am). These  three  groups  
of cows were allowed  the same grass silage  ad-libitum  while indoors;
There was a large response  in milk yield when animals  were allowed  to 
graze  Spring  grass.  The overall  milk yield in 1993 was lower  because  of a high  
proportion  of 1st lactation  cows.  Cows  fed 6 kg of concentrates  supplemented  
with grazed  grass and grass silage  produced  2.8 and 3.5 litres of milk per cow 
per day more milk than their comparable  group  indoors  full-time  on 6 kg of 
concentrates  and grass  silage  ad-lib.  The milk had also a higher  protein  content.  
Cows  fed 2 kg of concentrates,  grazed  grass  and grass  silage  produced  similar  
milk yield in 1993 and higher  milk yields  in 1994 than the group  indoors  full­
time. There  was also the beneficial  effect  of grazed  grass in terrms  of higher  
liveweight  gain.  The improved  performance  when  dairy  cows were  supplemented  
with grazed  grass was associated  with increased  total dry matter  intakes.
After  full-time  turnout  to pasture  in the April-May  period,  grass  growth  and 
grazing  conditions  can be erratic,  depending  on climatic  conditions. Grass  intakes 
of 15-17  kg DM  per cow per day have  been measured  in Moorepark  with Spring ­
calving  dairy cows over this period  under  good grazing  conditions  (1990  and 
1992) on grass-only.  This period  also coincides  with the start of the breeding  
season  when  breeding  starts in late-April  - early-May.  To obtain  good fertility  
performance,  cows  need  to be in a positive  energy  balance  at this stage.  Therefore,  
in periods  of poor growth  rates/difficult  grazing  conditions,  supplementation  
will be required.  A supplementation  study was carried  out in Moorepark  over 
this period  in 1993, and 1994, which  was a period  of poor grass growth  and 
difficult  grazing  conditions  (Table  4).
The cows  were stocked  at 5.25 cows  per hectare.  The average  response  was 
0.78 and 0.44 litres  of milk, and 0.44 and 0.63 litres  of milk per kg of concentrate

The results  indicate  that in situations  of poor  grass  supply  and poor  grazing  
conditions  in early Spring  that supplementation  is required.  The benefits  to 
supplementation  were  to be obtained in increased  milk  yield,  reduced  body  weight 
loss and improved  fertility  performance.  Supplementation  should  be introduced  
swiftly  and be large  enough  in quantity  to maintain  milk yields  and then taken 
out when grass supply  returns  to normal.
The Autumn  period  on dairy  farms  coincides  with large  changes  in the type  
and quantity  of forage  available  for dairy  cows.  The milk supply  pattern  at this
16
time  of year  can vary widely  depending  on calving  pattern  of the herd and feeding  
level. Table  6 gives the expected  milk yield per cow for early Spring-calving  
cows,  late Spring-calving  cows  and a supply  pattern  for herds with  40%  Autumn ­
calving  (Sept./Oct.)  and 60% Spring-calving  cows.

The potential  milk production  for early to mid-March  calving  herds  at this 
time of the year should  be noted.  Table  7 shows  the effect  of two different  feed 
allowances  as measured  by stocking  rate on milk yield from September  to the 
end of the year. The considerable  improvement  in milk yield was due to the 
availability  of extra grass and the availability  of extra silage which was fed 
when grass supply  was less than the requirements  of the herd. No concentrate  
was fed in these situations.

The supply  of grass from September  onwards  will depend  on current  grass  
growth  rates,  stocking  rates,  previous  grazing  management,  calving  pattern  and 
nitrogen  application.  The rapid reduction  in growth  rates from the end of 
September  onwards  results  in feed supply  being  less than feed required  to sustain  
target  milk yields.  The results  of a recent  trial carried  out in Moorepark  where  
Autumn  grass was supplemented  with concentrates  and silage is shown in 
Table 8.

Experimental  period:  10 weeks  (I4th September  - 23rd November,  ’92)
Grass  supply  was considered  not to be a significant  limiting  factor  in this 
experiment  as the cows were  not allowed  to graze  below  6-7 cm. The concentrate  
fed was 25% maize  distillers  and 75% beet pulp.  First-cut  silage  was fed (72% 
DMD)  and it was well preserved.  Supplementation  with silage  gave little or no 
response  in milk yield.  It also had a very negative  effect  on milk composition.  
Supplementation  with concentrate  had a very positive  effect  on milk yield.  The 
response  was 1.86 litres of milk for 2 kg concentrate  and 2.72 litres  of milk for 
4 kg of concentrate.  Concentrate  feeding  had a negative  effect  on the fat content  
of the milk but it had a slight  positive  effect  on the milk protein  and fat yield.
Autumn  supplementation  would  have to be economically  beneficial  within  
the overall  milk  quota.  Systems  where  additional  concentrates  are fed and which  
result  in increased milk  yield  per cow will have  the effect  of reducing the number  
of cows  in the herd.  In a low-cost  system  of production (which has high margins),  
then the cost of displacing  a cow will be higher.
However,  in many farm situations  grass supply  will not be adequate.  In a 
previous  experiment  carried  out in Moorepark,  a milk yield response  of 3.2 
litres per cow per day was recorded  over a six-week  period  for a silage  input  
of 8.5 kg silage  DM per cow per day. It has however  a detrimental  effect  on 
milk composition.  It should  be noted  that grazing  conditions  were not as good  
in this case and grass supply  would  also have been limiting.  Obtaining  target  
milk production  over the Autumn  / early-Winter  period  will depend  on getting  
the correct  blend  of grass,  silage  and concentrate  into the diet of the milking  
cow.
Genetic  merit
Genetic  progress  represents  a small but significant  and permanent  change  
over and above  progress  due to management.  The rate of genetic  progress  in 
milk fat and protein  yield has almost  trebled  (0.4%  per year to 1.1 %) for sires 
born over the ten-year  period  (1980  to 1990).  This trend looks  set to continue  
on and even increase  in the future. These developments  present new 
challenges  to the Irish system  of milk production  which  is mainly  based  on the
efficient  conversion  of home-produced  forage  (grazed  grass  and silage)  to milk.
A new research  programme  was initiated  in Teagasc,  Moorepark,  in 1994,  
to investigate  how very high genetic  merit  daily cows perform  under  an Irish 
system  of milk production.  Two contrasting  genetic  groups  of in-calf  heifers  
were assembled  (Table  9).

The pedigree  index  of the selected  group  of animals  (S) was on average  16 
units in RBI (RBI 95), 13 kg fat and 14 kg protein  higher  than the coHtrol  
group.  The selected  group  of heifers  (S) had a lower  PD (Predicted  Difference)  
for fat % and a slightly  lower  PD for protein  %. The sires of the animals  in the 
control  group were mainly  Arend  (ARN),  FI6 rocket,  Etazon  Bowi (EZB),  
Shinagh  Rohorst  belder  (RSG),  Nicholas Storm (NSM), and a selection of young  
bulls  on test. The sires  of the selected  (imported  heifers)  were mainly  Skalsumer  
Sunny  Boy (SSB),  Sunnylodge  Sammy  and Penn-Springs  (MR.C.).  It should  
be noted  that the control  group  of heifers  have a higher  RBI than the national  
average  heifer  in Ireland.  It is estimated  that the average  RBI (RBI 95) of first 
lactation  animals  in 1995 nationally  (IDRC)  is 104.
Three  different  feeding  systems  were evaluated  with each of the genotypes.  
System  A (Standard  Moorepark  System)  had a stocking  rate of 3 cows/ha  on 
an input of 350 kg N/ha and a planned  supplementation  level of 500 kg of 
concentrates.  In System  B (High concentrate  system),  the stocking  rate and 
nitrogen  input  were  the same  as in System  Abut  the level of concentrate  feeding  
was planned  at 1000 kg/cow.  In System  C, the nitrogen  and concentrate  
supplementation  levels  were again the same as in System  A but the aim was 
to allocate  unrestricted  levels  of high  quality  grass  and grass-silage  to the cows.  
The grass  production  year  in 1995 was very erratic with a very poor  grass  growth  
in August  / September  due to a large moisture  deficit.  Concentrate  
supplementation  was higher  than planned  as a result.  The actual concentrate  
feeding levels  were  863, 1449  and 851 kg concentrates/cow  for the Moorepark,  
High concentrate  and High grass feeding  systems
Tables  10 and 11 show  the production  data (1 st lactation)  for both genotypes  
for the Moorepark  and High concentrate  feeding  systems.  The higher  index  
heifers  produced  19% higher  milk yield or 13% more fat and protein  yield in 
the Moorepark  feeding  system.  This  difference  in milk  production  is very similar  
to that which  can be predicted  from their  genetic  index.  There  was no interaction  
between  genotype  of the cow  and the feeding  systems.  Throughout  the grazing  
season  it was evident  that the high merit  heifers  had higher  intakes  of grass  for
19
similar  levels  of utilization  as compared  to the medium merit  cows. It is estimated  
that this increase  in grass intake  ranged  from 3 to 5% over the total grazing  
season.  There  was no difference  in fertility  between  the two groups  of heifers. 
Overall,  the preliminary  results  for the final  year  of a three-year  study  indicates  
that high merit animals  can perform  well in an Irish production  system.

Given that genetic  merit will play an important  part in achieving  high 
performance,  the system of replacement  rearing  will be  equally  important. From  
an economic  and efficiency  point of view, it is essential  that they calve at 2 
years of age, provided  that they are well grown  and reach the target  weight  at 
calving.  The critical  target  weights  are 310 - 340 kg at mating  and 530 - 560 
kg at calving-down  at two years  of age. The spread in target  weights  is influenced

The milk production  system  described  above  works  well on dry land in the 
South  of Ireland.  Adjustments  will need to be made  to the system  to reflect  the 
differences  in soil type, location,  calving  pattern,  etc. The principles  described  
have general  application.  Table 12 outlines  the receipts,  costs  and margins  per 
cow and per litre obtainable  with the system  outlined.  Milk price is based  on
20
22p per litre. This system  gave a gross margin  of £1,056  per cow (20.2 p per 
litre of quota).  The variable  costs are £305 per cow (5.7p per litre). The net 
margin  is £737 per cow at 14. Ip per litre of milk.

Summary
The targets  in terms  of inputs,  outputs  and financial  performances  obtainable  
using  current  research  and technology  have  been  outlined  in this paper.  The top 
modern  intensive  Irish dairy farmers  (based  on Dairy  MIS data) are achieving  
these targets.  However,  as can be seen from another  paper in this Journal,  
“Production  performance  on dairy farms in relation  to milk quotas ”, a large  
number  of commercial  dairy farmers are not achieving  these  targets. The reasons  
range  from the lack of application  of modern  research  and technology  to quota  
management  on farms.  These  issues  are outlined  in detail  in the paper  referred  
to above.  Looking  to the future,  the biggest  challenges  are to develop  milk 
production  systems  which will sustain  present  profit  margins alongside  expected  
lower  milk prices.  The use of high genetic  merit  cows coupled  with efficient  
use of grazed  grass  and grass  silage  will be essential  in achieving  this. The milk  
produced  from this system  will have to have the correct  milk composition  and 
the possibility  of being  manufactured  into a wide  range  of milk products.  Lastly, 
the system  will have to be sustainable  in terms  of its impact  on the environment  
and the quality  of life for the farm family.

Winter  Milk  Production  - Opportunities  
for Improving  Production  with  Grass  and 
Grass  Silage
C. S. MAYNE
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of Northern  Ireland,  Hillsborough,
Co. Down.
Introduction
Production  of milk during  the winter  months  September  - March  incurs  
higher  feed and capital  costs than that produced  over the summer  period.  This 
reflects  the increased  reliance  on grass silage  rather  than grazed  grass and the 
capital  costs associated  with housing  of cows during  the winter  months.  The 
aim of this paper  is to examine  opportunities  for improving  the milk  production  
potential  of grass and grass silage  during  the winter  period,  thereby  reducing  
the costs  associated  with winter  milk  production  systems. The key factors  which 
influence  the efficiency  of winter  milk production  include:  cow genetic  merit;  
proportion  of grazed  grass  in the diet; silage  quality  and intake  characteristics;  
and level of concentrate  feeding.
Cow genetic  merit
There  has been a marked  increase  in the rate of genetic  gain within  the dairy  
herd in the United  Kingdom  (U.K.)  and Ireland  in recent  years with Coffey  
(1992)  reporting  current  rates of genetic  gain of 1.3% per year in milk fat plus 
protein  yield. The main effect of increasing  genetic  merit is that a greater  
proportion  of food energy  is partitioned  to milk production,  with less energy  
partitioned  to body condition.  For example  research  at Langhill  in Scotland  
(Veerkamp  et al., 1994)  indicates  that high merit  cows (RBI,jj  109 approx.)  on 
a ‘high forage ’ system  produced  12.2%  more  milk and yet only consumed  4.3%  
extra  dry matter  compared  to low merit  cows  (RBI,^j  96 approx.). The  overriding  
importance  of cow genetic  merit on efficiency  of production  was highlighted  
by the fact that high RBI cows (RBI.^j  109) given 1 t concentrates  per lactation  
produced  similar  milk solids  yields to low RBI cows (RBI,^j  96) given 2.5 t 
concentrates  per lactation.  ,
However,  it is important  to highlight  the relatively  modest  genetic  merit  of 
the high merit  cows in the Langhill  trials  and also the fact that the ‘high forage ’ 
system  involved  feeding  over 1 t of a high protein  concentrate.  In more  recent  
work  at Hillsborough,  the effect  of a wider  range  of concentrate  levels  on very 
high and moderate  genetic  merit  autumn  calving  cows  has been examined.  The 
results  given in Table 1 relate to performance  over a 12 week period  in early  
lactation.  High RBI (RBI,^,  138 approx.)  cows  produced  3.8 kg/day  more milk 
than medium  RBI (RBI,^, 101 approx.)  cows, irrespective  of concentrate  feed 
level. Milk fat content  was higher  with the high RBI cows,  which  also tended
22
to have  a higher  milk protein  content,  even at the lower  concentrate  feed level. 
In line with the Langhill  data, these  results  highlight  the marked  superiority  of 
high genetic  merit  cows,  irrespective  of concentrate  feed level, with high RBI 
cows  producing an additional  0.6-1.0  pence/litre  (2.7-4.5  p/gallon)  margin  over 
feed costs relative  to medium  RBI cows,  at the same concentrate  feed level.

High RBI cows on the low concentrate  feed level consumed  almost  10% 
more  silage  than  the medium  RBI cows.  Consequently,  high quality  silage  with 
high intake  characteristics  is critical  to maintain  performance  with high RBI 
cows at low concentrate  feed levels.
Grazed  grass  in winter  milk  systems
Whilst  autumn  calving  or winter  milk systems  are generally  perceived  as 
‘high silage ’ systems,  grazed  grass has a major  role in reducing  costs in these  
systems.  The ability  to maximise  use of grazed  grass,  particularly  in autumn,  
is very dependent  upon the calving  pattern  within  the herd. Management  of 
grass in autumn  is considerably  easier  with a 100%  autumn  calving  herd, than 
with a combined  spring/autumn  calving  herd. This reflects  the fact that in a 
pure autumn  calving  herd situation,  dry cows can be tightly  stocked  during  
August  and September  allowing  a build up of grass for late autumn  grazing.  
It is much  more  difficult  to build up a reserve  of grass in the autumn  where  the 
herd contains  a high proportion  of spring  calving  cows.
Recent  research  at Hillsborough  has shown that in order  to build up  sufficient  
grass for grazing  in mid November,  paddocks  should  be rested from early  
September.  This means  that the rotation  length  should  be increased  from early  
August  onwards up to a maximum  of 7-8 weeks by early  November.  Tbe increase 
in rotation  length  from early August  onwards  ties in with the drying  off period  
in an autumn  calving  herd. Good  responses  in autumn  grass growth  have also 
been obtained  with nitrogen  fertilizer  applied  up to 20 September.  For example
23
application  of 60 kg N/ha  on 20 September  has produced  grass  yield  responses  
of 7-9 kg DM/kg  N when measured  on 1 November,  representing  a cost of 
£40.50/t  grass DM.
The effects  of a three hour grazing  period  on performance  of September/  
October  calving  cows  grazing  in November  are shown  in Table  2. Grazing  for 
three  hours  per day resulted  in a 38% reduction  in silage  intake,  whilst  increasing  
milk yield by 2.1 litres/day  and increasing  milk protein.  The net effect  was an 
improvement  in margin  over  feed costs  of 1.7 pence  per litre (7.7 pence/gallon).

(pence/litre)
A major  factor  in determining  the extent  of reliance  on autumn  grazing  is 
the possible  adverse  effect  on spring  growth.  Data from Moorepark  (Roche  et 
ai, 1994) indicate  that whilst  grazing  up to 1 December  utilized  350 kg grass  
DM/ha  compared  with swards  closed  on 20 October,  the swards  closed  in 
December  had 450 kg DM/ha  less herbage  available  in early March  and 575 
kg DM/ha  less herbage  available  in late March.  However,  in other studies  at 
Hillsborough  swards  cut to 4 cm, to simulate  grazing,  in October,  November  
and December  had similar  yields  of herbage  by mid March. These  data suggest  
that autumn  grazing  should  cease by late November  in order to ensure  early  
turnout  of cows to grass in spring.
Early spring growth  is also influenced  by grass variety and  timing  of nitrogen 
in spring.  For example,  under  Northern  Ireland  conditions  the early perennial  
ryegrass  variety  Moy produces  2.15 t DM/ha  between  1 March  and 14 April 
whereas  the late variety  Garrick  only produces  0.7 t DM/ha  during  the same  
period  (Johnston,  1993).  Consideration  should  be given to introducing  early  
ryegrass  varieties,  such as Moy, on at least part of the grazing  area.
As with autumn grazing,  early  turnout  to grass  in spring  results  in a reduction  
in silage  requirements  and increases  in milk yield, as shown  in Table 2. The
24
net effect of early turnout  on 26 February  was an increase  in margin  
over feed costs of 2.6 p/litre (11.8 p/gallon)  compared  to turnout on 
16 April.
With tight block  calving,  grazing  management  of autumn  calving  cows is 
much  easier  than with a spring  calving  herd. September-October  calving  cows  
are well past peak yield  by the time of peak  grass  growth  in April/May  and this 
enables  use of higher  grazing  stocking  rates to control  spring  growth.  
Furthermore  grass  alone  is more  than adequate  to support  milk yields  up to 27 
litres/day  during  the spring  and early summer  period. The key factor  in grazing  
management  is to use high stocking  rates  (up to 7.4 cows/ha,  3 cows/acre)  during  
the April-June  period  to control  grass growth  and maintain  sward  quality  for 
late season.
Silage  for autumn  calving  cows
High quality,  high intake  grass silage  is critical  for profitable  winter  milk 
production,  given that grass silage  comprises  the main forage  for between  4- 
6 months  of the year. The key factors  involved  in producing  high digestibility,  
high intake  silage  are grass quality  at ensiling  and ensiling  technique.  Grass  
maturity  at cutting  is the major  factor  influencing  digestibility  of the resulting  
silage.  With intermediate  ryegrass  varieties,  each week delay in cutting  after  
mid May results  in a reduction  in digestibility  of 1.8 units.  Assuming  no change  
in concentrate  use, this decline  in digestibility  will normally  result  in a reduction  
in milk yield  of approximately  0.6 litres/cow/day.  For autumn  calving  cows  the 
aim should  be to ensile  first cut grass by mid May, with a second  cut taken six 
to seven weeks later. Longer  regrowth  intervals  result in a reduction  in 
digestibility.  Furthermore,  it is worth  noting  that reductions  in digestibility  in 
mid May occur irrespective  of whether  the sward is grazed  in early spring.  
Consequently  delaying  cutting  date to increase  grass yield following  grazing  
in early  spring  will result  in lower  digestibility  material.  A careful  balance  needs  
to be struck  between  the benefits  of spring  grazing  of silage  swards  and possible  
adverse  effects  on silage  digestibility  if cutting  date is delayed  too long in May.
It has long been  recognised  that grass  silage  has lower  intake characteristics  
than grazed grass.  Results  of a major  research  programme  at Hillsborough  (Steen 
etai, 1995)  indicate  that intake  of grass  silage is primarily  influenced by protein  
and fibre fractions  in the silage  and the relative  rates and extent  of digestion  
of these  components  within  the rumen.  Factors  such as pH, buffering  capacity,  
total acidity  and lactic  acid concentration  have relatively  little effect  on intake. 
Consequently,  one of the major  factors  contributing  to the reduced  intake  and 
performance  with grass  silage  relative  to grazed  grass  is the lower  digestibility  
of grass at ensiling  compared  to that of grazed  material.  The results  presented  
in Table 3 compare  performance  of cows offered  fresh grass or grass silage  
produced  from either  high or medium  digestibility  grass. Ensiling  resulted  in 
a 13% reduction  in DM intake,  whereas  a combination  of ensiling  and later 
cutting  resulted  in a reduction  in intake  of 29%.  Thus  the lower  intake  of grass  
silage  relative  to grazed  grass  can largely  be attributed to lower  grass  digestibility  
rather  than to the effects  of ensilage  per se.

The problem  in practice  is that high digestibility  silage  results  in reduced  
crop yield,  thereby  increasing  the cost of producing  silage.  The challenge  for 
research  is to examine  opportunities  to prevent  decreases  in digestibility  with 
increasing  grass  yield  or alternatively  to upgrade low/medium  digestibility  grass 
during  ensilage.
Effects  of wilting  and/or  additives.  Steen  et al. (1995)  have shown  that the 
key factors  influencing  silage  intake  are the protein  and fibre fractions  in the 
silage  and the relative  rates and extent  of digestion  of these  components  within  
the animal.  Furthermore,  they have developed  a highly  accurate  silage  intake  
prediction  system,  based  on analysis  of either  fresh  or dried  silage  samples.  The 
next stage is to develop  this test back  to analysis  of grass at cutting,  to enable  
prediction  of the feeding  value of silage from analysis  of the standing  grass  
crop.
Other  recent  research  indicates  that changes  in the protein  fraction  of grass  
in the early  stages  of ensilage,  due to plant  enzyme  systems,  have  a major  effect  
on silage  intake.  Work  in Canada  (Charmley,  1995)  has shown  that the activity  
of plant  enzyme  systems  can be reduced  either  by rapid  reduction  in pH of the 
ensiled  crop or by pre-wilting.  In general,  the more rapid the decrease  in pH 
or increase  in DM content,  the greater  the reduction in proteolytic  activity.  These  
observations  have led to renewed  interest  in the use of inoculant  additives  and/ 
or rapid wilting  systems.
In eleven  experiments  at Hillsborough  a range  of differing  inoculants  have  
been evaluated  with direct  cut grass,  as shown  in Table  4. Inoculant  treatment  
has consistently  increased  the rate of decline  in pH post ensiling,  although  little 
effect  on the final silage  fermentation  is observed.  On average  across  the 11 
experiments  inoculant  treatment  increased  silage  intake  and milk yield by 9.6%  
and 6.5% respectively.
In more recent  studies  the effect  of rapid wilting  systems  on silage  intake 
and performance  has been investigated.  The results  presented  in Table 5 indicate  
the effects  of rapid wilting  (average  wilting  period  39 hours)  over 8 separate  
harvests  in 1994.  Wilting  was  carried  out in good  conditions  with no rain at any 
harvest,  with grass being tedded  following  cutting  and again prior to being

picked  up by the harvester. Wilting  increased  silage  intake  by 20% but resulted  
in very small increases  in milk or milk solids  yield. Given  the increased  cost 
of wilting systems,  and the greater  field  losses  during  harvesting,  the conclusion  
is that simple  direct  cut systems  are much  superior  to more sophisticated  and 
expensive  harvesting  systems.  However  direct  cut systems  must be associated  
with good  effluent  control  systems.  Nonetheless,  investment  in effluent  control  
systems  is likely  to produce  a better  return  under  our climatic  conditions  than 
investment  in tedders  and other machinery  to enable  field wilting.

Alternative  forages.  Given  the lower intake  and performance  from grass

forages  such as forage  maize  and whole  crop wheat.  Results  presented  in Table

benefit  from  including  forage  maize  when similar  concentrates  are offered  with 
both grass silage and a grass/maize  silage  mixture.  However,  results  from  
England  (Phipps  et al, 1996)  suggest  an improvement  in milk yield and milk 
protein  content  with partial  replacement  of grass silage  by maize.  However,  
higher  protein  concentrates  were offered  with the grass/maize  silage  mixtures  
and part of the response  to maize  silage  is likely to have arisen  as a protein  
effect  rather  than a maize  effect.

of grass silage  with either  fermented  or urea treated  whole  crop wheat.  Whilst  
inclusion  of either  form  of whole  crop wheat  has consistently  increased  forage  
intake,  there was no beneficial  effect  on milk yield  or milk  composition  relative  
to high quality  grass silage  with cows receiving  7.0 kg concentrates/day.
These results  expose  some  of the myths  associated  with alternative  forages.  
Detailed  analysis  of data from trials in which  grass silage  has been partially  
replaced  by forage  maize  and whole  crop cereal  trials in the U.K. and Ireland  
indicates  either  no benefit  or only marginal  increases  in performance  relative  
to grass silage  only diets when similar  concentrates  are fed with both diets.  
Indeed,  these alternative  forages  have diverted  emphasis  from the primary  
objective  with  autumn-calving  herds  in good  grass  growing  areas  - the production  
of high digestibility,  high intake  grass silage.
Concentrate  feed levels  for autumn  calving  cows
Within  a milk quota context,  one of the key indicators  of dairy herd  
profitability  is the margin  over feed costs per litre or gallon  of milk produced.  
However,  this figure  should  not be considered  in isolation  but alongside  other  
indicators of efficiency  such as margin/cow,  margin/ha,  margin/£1000  invested  
etc. Given the differing  constraints  on individual  farms there is currently  
considerable  discussion  regarding  the relative  merits  of high vs medium  
concentrate  input systems  and their effect  on these efficiency  indicators.  An 
example  of the effects  of increasing  concentrate  feed level on silage intake,  
milk yield and composition  with cows offered  moderate  quality  grass silage  
and 18% crude  protein  concentrates  are shown  in Table  8. As concentrate  feed 
level increases,  silage  intake  is reduced  and milk  yield  and milk  protein  content  
increases.  Using  these  data,  the effect  of changes  in cost  of silage  and concentrates  
and in milk  price  on the ‘break-even ’ level  of concentrates  have  been determined  
as shown  in Table  9. These  ‘break-even ’ levels  have  been calculated  assuming  
no effect  of concentrate  feed level on labour,  housing  or other  capital  costs.  It 
is worth noting  that large  alterations  in the cost of silage  relative  to concentrates  
have  relatively  little  effect  on the ‘break-even ’ concentrate  feed level.  However,

Whilst  these  results  are based  on moderate  genetic  merit  cows,  there is no 
evidence  to indicate  that high  genetic merit  cows  respond  differently  to additional  
concentrate  feeding.  Rather,  as shown  in Table  1, high genetic  merit  cows  have  
higher  levels  of production  than medium  merit  cows,  irrespective  of level of 
concentrate  feeding.  Consequently,  these ‘break-even ’ levels  of feeding  apply  
equally  to high genetic  merit  cows.  Feeding  in excess  of these levels  can only 
be justified  on the basis  of savings  in labour  or other  capital  costs sufficient  to 
outweigh  the reductions  in margin  over concentrate  and forage  costs per litre.
Other  research work  at Hillsborough  has shown  that high protein  concentrates  
(up to 34% crude  protein)  can be used to reduce  concentrate  feed levels  whilst  
maintaining  milk yield. For example  this work has shown  that 6.5 kg/day  of 
a 34% protein  supplement  can produce  similar  milk  constituent  yields  to 10 kg/ 
day of a 17% protein  supplement,  providing  high quality  protein  sources,  e.g. 
soya  beamfish  meal in the ratio 78:22,  are used in the high protein  supplement.  
Using  these  relationships,  derived  from  a series  of trials  at Hillsborough,  a range  
of feed options  have been calculated  to support  an average  milk yield of 24 
litres/cow/day  over the winter  period  as shown  in Table 10. With low cereal  
grain  prices  (e.g. £70/t)  then a high cereal,  low protein  concentrate,  fed at high 
levels,  results  in the lowest  feed  cost per litre. In contrast,  with high cereal  grain  
prices,  as at present,  low levels  of a high protein  concentrate  e.g. 5.0 kg/day  
of a 34%  protein  concentrate,  offered  with high digestibility,  high intake  silage,  
offers  the best opportunity  to reduce  feed costs.  Assuming  high genetic  merit  
cows respond  similarly  these results  would  suggest  that this feeding  system  
(5.0 kg/day  of a 34% protein  concentrate  with high digestibility,  high intake  
silage)  could  support  milk yields  up to 27-28  litres/day  with high genetic  merit  
(RBI,jj 138) dairy cows.

Conclusions
Winter  milk production  incurs  higher  feed and capital  costs than milk  
produced  during  the summer  period.  The key features  of profitable  winter  milk  
product\
1. Use of high genetic  merit cows.
2. Specific  autumn  calving  herds with tight block  calving.
3. Maximum  use of grazed  grass in autumn  and spring.
4. Clear focus on producing  high digestibility,  high intake grass silage  
(alternative  forages  are a costly  diversion  from the real task of producing  
high quality  grass silage).
5. Use of moderate  levels  of high protein  concentrates  (up to 5.0 kg of a 34% 
protein  concentrate)  providing  adequate,  high  quality  grass silage  is available.
Using  these guidelines  it is possible  to reduce  feed and forage  costs to 6.6 
pence/litre  (30 pence/gallon)  for winter  milk production.

Cows

SECTION  I - PRINCIPLES  AND  TARGETS  
Introduction  ^
The general  framework  for optimising  returns  from summer  milk  production  
has been described  in the paper  by Dillon.  The paper  by Crosse  outlines  the 
reality with regard  to performance  of dairy cows and some major  structural  
problems  with  regard  to the achievement  of these  targets. The essential  features  
of this system  are achieved  by matching  the appetite  of the herd,  as determined  
by calving  date and spread  of calving,  to the pattern  of grass growth.  This is 
the optimum  system  of summer  milk  production  for Ireland  (with  modifications  
for soil or location  problems).  Other  systems  have to be judged  and compared  
with it.
It must be recognised  that when the main elements  of summer  milk  
production,  such as nitrogen  application,  calving  date and compactness,  supply  
of early grass,  long grazing  season,  silage  conservation  and concentrate  input,  
are correct  on dairy farms,  that the next requirement  is that very good  
performance  from the cows must be achieved.  This must come mainly  from  
grazed  grass. This is one place  where  very many  dairy  farmers  are falling  down  
- they are not achieving  the potential  performance  from their cows on grazed  
pasture.  High yields  per cow are being achieved  on many dairy farms.  But 
unfortunately  the success  is in many cases coming  from high levels of 
supplementary  feeding  in place of grass.
This paper  highlights  the main features  of grazing  management  which  will 
allow for high intakes  of grazed  pasture  and thereby  increases  in cow 
performance  from pasture.  The consequence  of this will be to reduce  costs of 
milk production  and increase  returns  by the simple  expedient  of getting  more  
grass into the cows in place of costly  feeds.
Nutritive  value  of grazed  grass
Grazed  grass,  when  correctly  managed,  is of high nutritive  value.  Feeding  
value is the product  of nutritive  value  by intake.  High intakes  of grazed  grass  
are achievable.  A typical  analysis  of grass selected  by the grazing  herd show  
the following  values:  crude  protein,  180-230;  cell wall,  350-400;  cellulo-lignin,  
190; soluble  carbohydrate,  150-200;  and ash, 80-90  g per kg dry matter.  This 
grass  has an organic  matter  digestibility  of between  80-86%.  Highest  levels  are 
obtained  in March/April  (84-86%),  lowest  in midsummer  (78-80%)  and 
somewhat  higher  again in autumn  (79-80%).  Digestibility  is a key nutritive  
parameter and is the major  determinant  of metabolizable  energy  (ME)  content.  
Control  of grass  digestibility and hence  metabolizable  energy content  is a critical 
element  of grazing  management  for milk production.
33
Some  important  response  factors  in grazing
Grazing  experiments  at Moorepark  over the last 10 years  have established  
the following  responses  in intake.
Allowances  - an increase  of 0.4 - 0.5 kg DM in intake will result from  
increases  of 1 kg DM of daily allowance  of grazed  grass within  the practical  
range  of allowances.
Digestibility  - a one unit decrease  in digestibility  of grazed  pasture  will 
decrease  daily intake  by an average  0.60  kg DM.  At low digestibility  the reduction  
in intake  is much  greater  (0.8 kg DM) than at high digestibility  (0.3 kg DM).
Milk Production  Responses  - an increase  in intake  of grazed  pasture  of 1 
kg of DM will give an increase  of 1 kg of daily milk yield per cow within  
practical  limits.  Obviously  if the cows  are grossly  underfed  there  will be a large  
increase.  Alternatively,  if the cows  are eating  close  to their  limit  of grazed  grass,  
they cannot  consume  more.  This response  occurs  in the range  of 12-17  kg DM 
intake/day.
Cow Genetic  Merit  - if the potential  of the herd, because  of increases  in 
genetic  merit,  moves  by 1 kg of milk per day over the lactation  - daily intake  
of grass will increase  by 0.4 -0.5 kg DM.
Size of  cow - 1.7 kg of grass  DM intake  extra  per day is needed  to maintain  
a 600 kg cow compared  to a 500 kg cow.
Grazing  management
The objective  in grazing  cows  is to achieve  high intakes  of grass  every  day 
if possible.  It is important  to at least have high intakes  over a period  of time 
if it is not possible  on a very short  term basis.  Major  budget  decisions  are made  
with regard  to overall  stocking  rate, N-input  and conservation  management  that 
help to ration  grass  on a long term and medium  term  basis. This is because  there  
is a limit to the amount  of grass grown  each year on a farm and its growth  
pattern  is very unevenly  distributed  across  the year. This aspect  of the overall  
system  of summer  milk production  is covered  in Dillon ’s paper.  The budgeting  
of grass  in the short  term is essentially  offering  the herd enough  grass  each day 
(or over a 2-3 day period)  which  will allow the herd to consume  enough  to 
sustain  their yield of milk. However,  because  of the tendency  of grass to 
deteriorate  in quality  (digestibility)  if it is undergrazed,  it is also extremely  
important  to avoid  offering  the herd too much  (i.e. leaving  too high a residue  
in paddocks  when moving  on to the next paddock).
Herd  demand
There  are two main factors  which  determine  how much grass cows need. 
Firstly,  the bigger  the size of the cow, the more feed she needs to maintain  
herself.  Secondly,  a cow ’s genetic  potential  will determine  her ability tc  produce  
milk.  A cow yielding  301 of milk per day will consume  more  grass  than a cow  
yielding  201 of milk at the same  stage  of lactation.  A third complicating  factor  
is the loss of weight  by cows in early lactation  and the gain in weight  by cows  
from mid-lactation  onwards.  When  cows  lose weight  in early  lactation,  they are

in effect  supplementing  their intake  of feed in order  to assist  milk production.  
They can by this mechanism  produce  higher  yields  than is possible  from their  
dietary  intake  of grazed  grass.  Additionally,  when cows are preparing  for the 
next lactation  and gaining  in weight,  they require  more intake  of feed than is 
required  by their output  of milk and maintenance.
Table 1 shows  the average  daily demand  for grass for two different  levels  
of milk potential  and five weight  categories.  As size of cow increases,  demand  
increases  by 1.7 kg DM/100  kg liveweight.  As total yield over the lactation  
increases,  daily  intake  increases.  This represents  an increase  of 0.4-0.5  kg DM/  
day extra feed for each extra 1 kg of milk produced.
The average  herd demand  for grass  in Ireland  is around  16-18  kg DM daily, 
depending  on genetic  potential.  The national  RBI is around  100-105.  Top dairy  
farmers  are closer  to 110 and their  herd demand  is likely to be about  18 kg grass  
DM daily/cow.
The herd appetite  should  decline  with advancing  lactation  stage by a 
substantial  amount  because  of declining  milk  yield.  However,  because  the herd  
is increasing  in weight  (1 kg liveweight  gain per day is equivalent  to an extra  
3 kg, approximately, of DMI)  and advancing  in pregnancy  this change  is usually  
not great.  The ME content  of grass (and net-energy-NE)  is also lower  in mid­
season  and in the Autumn  than in the March  to May  period.  Therefore,  the herd 
needs  to consume  somewhat  more  DM to obtain  the same ME (or NE) intake  
as in early season.
In summary,  the amount  of feed (as grazed  grass)  the herd will need each  
day will be about 16-18 kg DM/cow.  The herd should  not lose more than 0.5 
kg/cow/day  in early lactation.  If there is insufficient  grass available  to allow  
for an intake figure  of this magnitude  then supplementary  feeding  may be 
necessary.
Factors  affecting  intake  at pasture
Three  important  factors  impact  on the ability  of the cow to eat enough  grass.
1. How much is available  and how much is offered.
2. What is the quality/digestibility  of the grass.
3. Grazing  or ground  conditions  during  grazing.
35
Very many  Irish dairy  fanners  cannot  judge  how much  pasture  is available  
for grazing  and how much  was  eaten  in a particular  paddock.  In order  to improve  
the ability  of the farmer  to feed the cows properly  at pasture,  those  two basic  
points  need  to be learned.  This can only  be taught  and demonstrated  in the field  
and if the farmer  wants  to increase  his skills  in this regard  he must  spend  more  
time studying  his paddocks  and assessing  grass supply.
Daily  grass  allowance  is basically  the utilizable  grass  in a paddock  divided  
by the number  of cows  grazing  on that paddock  and then divided  by the number  
of days the herd stays in the paddock.  It is a very important  concept  in grazing  
management.  If the allowance  is too low, the herds ’ intake  will be also be low. 
The herd will graze out the paddock  extremely  well. Therefore,  as daily  
allowance  is reduced,  intake  falls and the amount  of grass left behind  in the 
paddock  after  grazing  also falls.  This is shown  graphically  in Figure  1. The well 
known  law of diminishing  returns  sets in as allowance  is increased.  Eventually,  
at high allowances,  very little additional  increase  in daily intake  is got from  
further  increases  in daily  allowances.  The residues  on the paddocks  also increase  
enormously  (i.e. the height  of sward  after grazing).
The optimum  situation  is to offer the cows  just enough  to allow  them,  by 
a bit of effort,  to eat enough  and leave  the paddock  clean.  If the cows  are offered  
19-20  kg of grass DM above  4 cm, under  very good grazing  conditions,  they 
can eat 17-18  kg DM daily.  Very good grazing  conditions  mean  that the cows  
are not marking  the ground  and are not soiling  the grass.
To simplify  matters,  if the cows  eat down  to a post-grazing  height  of 6 cm 
in the paddock  from  April  to early to mid-June,  and are then moved  on to the 
next  paddock,  these  conditions  will be met.  This  is also important  for controlling  
the quality  of the grass which  will be subsequently  offered  for grazing  in the 
following  grazing  rotations.
FIGURE  1 : RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  INTAKE  AND GRASS  ALLOWANCE
DAILY  GRASS  ALLOWANCE
36
A post-grazing  height  of 6 cm implies  that a mosaic  of well and not so well 
grazed  areas will appear  on the paddock.  These  tall and short grass areas are 
the inevitable  consequence  of cattle  grazing.  Cattle  will graze  the areas  around  
the dung deposits  less severely  than the clean areas.  To attempt  to graze the 
paddock  so as the  force  the cows  to eat out all of the tall grass  areas will  severely  
depress  intake.  The compromise  is to leave the paddock  grazed  to a degree  
where  the tall or partially  rejected  areas  comprise  around  20-25% of the paddock  
area and are reasonably  well grazed.
Post grazing  sward  height  (which  is equivalent  to the amount  of grass left 
behind)  can be used to achieve  the correct  daily allowance.  However,  a 
knowledge  of grass supply  ahead  of the cows is also very important,  in order  
to anticipate  surpluses  and deficits  which  may be appearing.
The digestibility  of grass  is the quantity  of it which  is eaten  and not excreted  
in the dung.  It is normally  very high under  good  grazing  management  (around  
80%).  It means  that if a cow eats 16 kg of grass DM she will excrete  around  
3 kg of dung as DM. In reality  of course,  this will be 40-50  kg of fresh dung  
every day.
Green  leaf  is highly  digestible.  Grass  will be low in digestibility  when  it has 
a lot of stem,  flower  heads  and dead  material  through  the pasture.  The problem  
with this type of pasture  is that intake  will be low because  cows  don’t like the 
material  offered.  They find it difficult  to graze  and they digest  it less, i.e. they 
extract  less nutrients  from it.
One  can have  a very  high  daily grass allowance  and achieve  very low intakes  
because  the sward  will limit intake  due to the poor  quality  material  it contains.  
In late April/May/June  when growth  rates of grass are very high, grazing  
management  must succeed  in preventing  pastures  getting  ahead  of the cows  
demand  and forming  seed-heads.  Cows  will only achieve  high performance  on 
leafy pastures.  Figure  2 outlines  the potential  loss in total lactation  yield when
FIGURE  2 : EFFECT  OF POOR  GRASS  
QUALITY  FROM  JULY  ONWARDS
37
cows graze pastures  from mid-summer  onwards  that were previously  
undergrazed  in the April to June period.
While  a post-grazing  height  of 6 cm is recommended  for the April to June  
period  for correct  feeding  at that time and for controlling  subsequent  sward  
quality,  grazing  experiments  at Moorepark  clearly  show a benefit  in reducing  
grazing  severity  to a post-grazing  of 7-8 cm from  mid-June  onwards.  This may  
not always  be possible  on tightly  stocked  dairy farms.  It does,  however,  indicate  
that because  of the change  in sward  structure  from mid-summer  onwards  that 
cows  will benefit  from  being  offered  more  grass.  Figure  3 outlines  the detrimental  
effect  of maintaining  too high a grazing  pressure  on yield per cow from this 
time onwards.
It is important  to remember  that the effects,  in practice  on dairy farms,  of 
too high a grazing  pressure  and poor  grass  quality  are separate.  This  means  that 
if you have created  leafy  pastures  by correct  grazing  in May/June,  you will not 
derive  a benefit  from  it, if you do  not offer  enough  of that leafy  pasture  to cows  
from  mid-June  onwards.  Alternatively,  if you have  poor  quality  pastures  because  
of undergrazing  in May/June,  you cannot  achieve  the same yield from them,  
for the same  allowance  as leafy  pastures.  It also means  that the effects  are additive 
and the worst  possible  situation  is to begin  to graze  out previously  undergrazed  
pastures  from mid-summer  onwards.
Wet ground  conditions
In early Spring  soft ground  conditions  are quite antagonistic  to good  
utilization  of pastures.  Even where  the budgeting  is done well and cows have  
enough  pasture,  intakes  are often low because  grass becomes  soiled due to 
walking  and poaching.  In these  conditions  some  things  can be  done  to minimise  
damage,  reduce  soiling  and maintain  performance.
Cows  are usually  out by day only at this time. High intakes  of pasture  can 
be achieved  in a few hours  of grazing.  Indoor  feeding  of silage  and concentrates  
(at reduced  rates)  is happening  concurrently.  Cows  do not need to be left in the 
pasture  if they have achieved  around  6-8 kg of grass  DM intake.  Cows  should  
not be allowed  to stand  on grazed areas. If, because  of wet conditions,  or driving  
rain, cows  are not grazing  they should  be moved  indoors.  You should  not walk 
cows  over grazed  grass  to get to the area you want  to graze.  It is inevitable  that 
some damage  will be done on some areas but it is important  that some grass  
is included  as part of the diet. It is not a requirement  to graze  tightly  during  the 
first grazing  cycle.  On the contrary,  a light grazing  is very beneficial  as it helps  
to avoid  excessive  pasture  damage  and also  aids recovery of the grazed  pastures.  
At this time of year the rule should  be on and off as quickly  as possible  until 
ground  conditions  improve.
Provision  of early  grass
When  calving  date is matched  to the supply  of early  grass,  the early grass  
needs  to be as well managed  as the calving  pattern.  It does not make  sense  to 
compactly  calve  the herd at the right time in Spring  and not provide  the early  
grass  that is possible  in Ireland.  Introducing  grazed  grass  to the Spring  calving
38
has a number  of major  advantages.  It gives  a very large  nutritional  boost  to the 
cow because  of the exceptionally  high  feeding  value  of March/early  April  grass.  
An increase  in milk yield per cow usually  results  and milk protein  content  is 
also lifted. Cost of milk production  can be reduced  dramatically  because  
concentrate  feeding  levels  can be reduced  while milk yield is maintained.
Where  cows are turned  out early and achieve  an intake  of 6-7 kg of grass  
DM the following  benefits  accrue.
a) Compared  to cows indoor  full time consuming  8.5 kg silage  DM + 6.0 kg 
concentrate,  cows on grass plus 5.0 kg silage DM + 6.0 kg concentrate  
produce  0.6 gallons  of milk more + 0.1% unit of milk protein  + positive  
weight  gain per cow
b) Compared  to cows indoor  consuming 8.5 kg silage  DM + 6.0 kg concentrate,  
cows  on grass  + 6.2 kg silage  DM + 2.0 kg concentrate  produce  a similar  
milk yield of similar  composition,  i.e. a saving  of 4 kg concentrates.
The implications  of these results  are obvious.  To provide  for early Spring  
grass,  the pastures  need to be ryegrass  dominant  and the soil needs  to be in an 
adequate  state of fertility.  When  these conditions  are met the timing  and rate 
of Spring  nitrogen  and the previous  Autumn  closing  date are all important.  In 
a low-stocked  farm the effect  of Autumn  closing  date of pastures  will not be 
felt too severely  because  there is so much land available  to graze in Spring.  
However,  on well managed  farms  which  are tightly  stocked  any over extended  
grazing  into the early winter  will be most clearly  seen in reduced  supply  of 
grass the following  Spring.  Delays  in Spring  nitrogen  application  will also 
dramatically  reduce  Spring  supply  of grass.
Farms  that have a scattered  calving  pattern  will not usually  feel the effects  
of reduced  Spring  grass  supply  as acutely  as those  with a compact  and targeted
FIGURE  3 lEFFECT  OF TOO-HIGH  A 
STOCKING  RATE  FROM  JULY  
ONWARDS
39
calving  pattern  because  the herd feed demand  in Spring  will not rise sharply  
due to the prolonged  calving  period.  When the calving  period  becomes  
concentrated  and the mean  calving  date is moved to within  4-6 weeks  of turnout,  
the demand  for Spring  grass will increase  dramatically  and any factor  which  
significantly  compromises  Spring  grass supply  will be clearly  felt.
The recommendation  is to apply 50 kg N/ha as urea as early as possible,  
around  January/early  February,  and rest pastures  in Autumn  at least before  the 
beginning  of December.
Utilization  of early  grass
The grazing  management  during  the first cycle is of critical  importance  to 
the overall  management  of the pastures.  There  is not enough  grass growth  at 
this time in Spring  to provide  adequate  recovery  if the first grazing  cycle is 
completed  too soon. It is essential  to prolong  the cycle out to mid-April.  It 
should  start  as early as possible  with calved  cows  without  causing  undue  damage  
to the fields.  Budgeting  of the grass  is important.  The farm  cover  of grass  needs  
to be assessed  and the grazing  of the available  land area can then be planned  
to extend  this rotation  to the desired  date. Silage  ground  can be grazed  depending  
on turnout  date, but the closing  of silage  ground  by early  April should  not be 
compromised.  In areas with a late Spring  turnout  the completion  of the first 
grazing  cycle  often  poses  many  problems  due to the accumulation  of too much  
grass  towards  the end of the rotation.  The end of the first grazing  cycle  can be 
early  May  in many  areas.  This  can effectively  mean  that it becomes  increasingly  
difficult  to graze  out the last paddocks  to the correct  height.  An earlier  start to 
grazing  will help to ameliorate  this situation.
Summary
The main limiting  factor  affecting  cow performance  on pasture  in Ireland  
is energy  intake.  The intake  can be kept high by offering  enough  leafy grass  
to the cows.  Daily  allowance  and grass  digestibility  should  be two of the main  
concerns  of dairy farmers  throughout  the grazing  season.
SECTION  II - GRASS  BUDGETING
Introduction
Most  dairy  farmers  are familiar  with  the concept  of  judging  how much silage  
is in the yards prior to the winter.  This exercise  is important  in order  to make 
decisions  on the rationing  of that feed or to estimate  how many  days feeding  
can be achieved  at a desirable  feed intake  level.  Feed  budgeting  of grazed  grass  
is a similar  but more  difficult  exercise.  It involves  assessing  yields  of grass  on 
the paddocks  at regular  intervals.  This will produce  information  on the supply  
of grass and how this supply  is changing  over time, i.e. is it increasing  or 
decreasing,  what level of intake  is being  achieved  and how much  is growing?
Feed  budgeting  in practice
There  are three  levels at  which feed budgeting  of grass  is done.  On an annual
40
basis,  the stocking  rate is matched  to the production  of grass.  Using  300 kg of 
N per hectare,  a stocking  rate of 2.6 - 2.7 cows  per hectare  can be carried.  The 
growth  of grass is very unevenly  distributed  and silage  conservation  does two 
important  things.  It takes surpluses  of grass and conserves  them as silage  for 
the winter.  It thereby  helps  to control  the supply  of grass to the grazing  cows.  
This intermediate  or medium  term feed budgeting  involves  2 cuts of silage  
generally.  These  concepts  and practices  are very familiar  to dairy farmers.
The short term feed budgeting  is not as well known  and generally  not 
practised  by dairy  farmers.  This involves  a knowledge  of what  is happening  in 
each paddock  i.e. how much  grass is on that paddock  before  and after  grazing.  
This gives information  on the level of intake  that cows are achieving.  It will 
also tell how severely  that paddock  was grazed.  It will also, over a number  of 
grazing  rotations,  give information  on how much grass is being grown  on 
individual  paddocks.
If the farm is walked  on a regular  basis,  say once a week,  and all paddocks  
are assessed  for grass cover,  some very important  additional  information  will 
be got. This information  is in addition  to that got when examining  pre- and 
post-grazing  grass cover  in the paddocks  which  are about  to be or have just  
been grazed.
Total grass  on all the paddocks  on the farm are assessed.  Over  a number  of 
weeks  a series  of pictures  of grass supply  will be accumulated.  These  pictures  
will show  if grass  cover  is reducing,  i.e. intake  is greater  than grass  growth,  or 
they may indicate  that grass  cover  is increasing,  i.e. intake  is less than growth.  
They are, in reality,  forecasts  of impending  surpluses  or deficits.
How  to estimate  the level of intake  achieved  in a paddock
This procedure  is a simple  arithmetic  exercise  when the grass yield level 
before  and after grazing  in a particular  paddock  is known  or is estimated.
Obviously,  this figure is more meaningful  if done across  a number  of 
paddocks  (say 5-6) as any error will be evened  out somewhat.  If the intake  is 
very much  out and is not a meaningful  figure, it is very  likely that the estimation  
of pre-grazing  grass yield is inaccurate.  In most cases the post-grazing  yields  
will be estimated  much better.  A knowledge  of how daily milk yields are 
progressing  will indicate  gross inaccuracies.  A less likely cause is that the 
paddock  area is wrong.  However,  an accurate  measurement  of paddock  areas  
would  help a lot.
The measurement  or assessment  of severity of grazing  by use of post-grazing  
height  goes hand in hand with this procedure.  By assessing  post-grazing  yield  
in a paddock,  a good overall  assessment  of degree  of grazing  severity  will be 
obtained.  If the grazing  system  is based  on temporary  sub-divisions  of existing  
paddocks  then a very practical  system  is available  to the farmer  to learn by 
experience  how to assess  pasture  yield.
If an existing  paddock  is assessed  for yield,  and an area is allocated  for a 
single  grazing  or a day’s grazing  and if the pre-grazing  yield  is underestimated,  
then the resulting  grazing  will be over lenient.  If on the other hand, the pre­
grazing  yield is overestimated,  then the paddock  will be too severely  grazed.
41
A farmer  using  this method  will quickly  learn to assess  grazing  yields  and get 
his feeding  levels right. The bulk tank reading  will help enormously.  The 
following  is an example  of how intake  can be calculated  based on yield  
assessments.
1) Pre-grazing  yield = 3500 kg DM/ha  (to ground  level)
2) Post-grazing  yields  = 2000 kg DM/ha  (to ground  level)
3) Paddock  size = 0.809 ha (2 acres)
4) Residency  time in the paddock  = 2 days (4 grazings)
5) Herd size = 40 cows
Then Intake/cow/day  can be calculated  as (1-2) x 3
4x5
e.g. 3500-2000  x 0.809  = 15.2 kg DM
2 X 40
What  is farm  cover  of grass?
Farm cover  of grass is basically  the average  yield of grass on all of the 
paddocks  being  grazed.  It is an average  of the paddocks  about  to be grazed  and 
those  just grazed  as well as those  in the middle  of the grazing  rotation.  Table 
2 shows  an example  of the type of data which  results  from a farm walk where  
all the paddocks  are assessed  for yield.  In this example  the cows have grazed  
Paddock  1 and are going  into Paddock  2. It is assumed  that all paddocks  are 
grazed  down  to 1600 kg DM/ha.  In reality  of course  this will vary around  that 
figure.  The farm cover  is 2443 kg DM/ha  (average  of the 10 paddocks).  The 
pre-grazing  yield  is 3760  and the post grazing  yield is 1600 kg DM/ha.  As can 
be seen, the highest  growth  rates since  the last defoliation  in the paddocks  are 
being achieved  on the paddocks  with the highest  amount  of grass. These  
paddocks  are now in an active stage of recovery.  The more recently  grazed  
paddocks  (8-10)  have low growth  rates.  The average  growth  rates refer  to that 
which  occurred  on each paddock  since its last defoliation.  It, therefore,  is the 
average  farm growth  rate as the individual  paddocks  are recovering  at different  
intervals  in time.

estimation  it is possible  to see what is happening  on the farm over time.
In this example,  farm cover  (average  of 10 paddocks)  has dropped  from  
2443 to 2357 and 2200 on days 1, 8 and 15, respectively.  This means  intake  
or level of grass utilization  is greater  than growth.  It is clear that grass cover  
is decreasing.  The highlighted  paddocks  in each week (2, 6, and 10) show  the 
pre-grazing  yields.  They  have  decreased  from 3760  to 3580  and 3400.  The level 
of post-grazing  yields  is being  maintained  at 1600  kg DM/ha.  Although,  intake  
is greater  than grass  growth,  performance  can be maintained  over the medium  
term by clever  grazing  management.
Rotation  length  will decrease  slightly  in order  to maintain  intake.  The farmer  
knows  what is happening.  Supplements  can be introduced  to keep cover  and 
performance  up. Supplements  can be delayed  in the expectation  of improvements  
in growth.  But at least the farmer  is monitoring  the situation  and is in control.  
An opposite  situation  can occur,  of course,  where  farm cover  is increasing.  In 
this situation  grass growth  is greater  than intake.  This can lead to potentially  
serious  problems  of over supply  of grass and undergrazing  of paddocks  in a 
short time if it occurs  in May for instance.  If it occurs  in August  it would  be 
desirable  because  farm  cover  would  be building  up during  a period  when growth  
is likely to fall off.
Early  spring  budgeting
In early Spring  the supply  of grass is dictated  by the timing  and level of 
Spring  nitrogen  application  and Autumn/Winter  closing  date. If the Spring  has 
been mild and relatively  dry there will be a good supply  of grass. However,  
growth  will still be low.
Grass  supply  on the farm must  be known  in order  to extend  the first rotation  
to mid-April  where  growth  will be sufficient  to provide  adequate  cover  for the 
second  grazing  cycle.
1) Initial  farm cover  (March  10th) = 2200 kg DM/ha
2) Target  post-grazing  severity  = 2000 kg DM/ha
3) Anticipated  grass growth  (between  March 10 and April 15)
= 30 kg DM/ha/day
4) Length  of 1st grazing  cycle  = 36 days
43
5) Desired  level of grass DM intake/cow/day = 6 kg DM.
Growth  over the period  (6 kg/ha)  is 1080 = 36 days x 30 kg dm growth  per 
ha per day. Intake  (kg/ha)  is
534 = 36 days x 40 cows x 6 kg DMI  
20 paddocks  x 0.809 ha/paddock  
Farm cover  on April 15 per ha
2200 + 1080 (growth)  - 534 
(intake)  = 2746
There  is also a need to know what the likely  growth  is going  to be during  
this period  and the level of grass intake  to be achieved.  The calculation  shows  
how such a budget  may be done, where  40 cows have 20 paddocks  of 0.809  
ha (2 acres)  available  to them.  The whole  farm will be grazed  starting  with the 
paddocks  intended  for silage.  The initial farm cover  is fairly even because  of 
the winter  rest and the low growth  rates  over  that period.  An effort  will be made  
not to graze  severely  in order  to help regrowths  for the second  cycle.  Silage  will 
be fed by night and concentrates  in two feeds daily to provide  11 kg DM per 
day of total intake  of these feeds.
Farm  cover  has increased  by 546 kg DM/ha  and growth  rates are now high. 
It is possible  to begin  the second  grazing  cycle  at a much  higher  stocking  rate 
now. If a higher  level of intake  is required,  say 8-10 kg DM/cow/day,  then farm  
cover  on April 15 will be around  2400  to 2570.  This means  that the higher  level 
of grass intake  achieved  during  the first grazing  by either  less supplementary  
feeding  or tighter  grazing  may necessitate  more supplementary  feeding  for a 
period  during  the second  grazing  cycle.
It is important  to remember  that the above  is only an example.  Conditions  
will vary from farm to farm and year to year. The figures  or values  refer to the 
average  events  during  the first grazing  cycle.  As farm cover  increases  during  
this cycle,  there  is more  scope  to get more  grass  into  the cows  and reduce  indoor  
feeding  more.  Also, initially  while  paddocks  will not be grazed  too severely, 
towards  the end of the cycle tighter  grazing  should  be practised.
A similar  procedure  to this can be used in the September  period  to gauge  
grass  cover  and estimate  the likely  impact  of present  feeding  levels  of grass  on 
future  grass  supply.  This is important  in order  to achieve  a long grazing  season 
while at the same time not compromising  intakes  of the cows.
Pasture  mass  estimation
Many  procedures  are available  to assist  a farmer  to estimate  pasture  mass. 
The mechanical  devices  like plate meters,  calibrated  against  actual yield  
estimations  are usually  beyond  the scope  of farmers.  The visual  assessment  of 
pasture  yield is used very successfully  in Moorepark.  Calibration  of the eye, 
however,  is very important  because,  as the sward  structure  changes  throughout  
the year,  the bulk density  also  changes.  Therefore  the height  by yield relationship  
will alter drastically.
44
Visual  assessment  of pasture  mass  cannot  be learned  in the theatre  or in the 
laboratory.  It must  be learned  through  the experience  of actually  rationing  cows  
at pasture.  By knowing  the dry matter  requirement  of cows,  their daily milk 
yield,  the grass  growth  bulletins,  the careful  estimation  of pre and post pasture  
yield and the allocated  area grazed  each day (or the area fraction  or multiple  
of days) the required  experience  will be built up.
Summary
Feed budgeting  will add precision  to grazing  management.  Visual  
assessments  of pasture  cover  are likely  to be much  more  accurate  than mechanical  
methods  such as plate meters.  Cutting  grass strips is too time consuming  on 
farms. With experience  in paddock  subdivision  and regular  farm walks,  the 
farmer  will begin to increase  his skill level at yield estimation.

Target  10
An Australian  Dairy  Industry  Approach  
to Making  More  Profitable  Use of Pasture
BRUCE  KEFFORD
Dairy  Industry  Programme  Co-ordinator,  Agriculture  Victoria,  Australia.
It is a great privilege  to be invited  to speak at the 50th Irish Grassland  
Conference  about  what  is arguably  the Victorian  dairy  industry ’s most  successful  
extension  project.
Background
Victoria  dominates  the Australian  dairying  industry  producing  over 60% of 
the milk, 75% of the manufactured  products  and over  85% of the exports,  which  
go primarily  to the Asia/Pacific  region  and the Middle  East.
Dairy  farmers  in South  Eastern  Australia  are second  only to New Zealand  
in terms of the lowest  cost of milk production  and many are at the world  
benchmark" ’.
A typical  Victorian  dairy farm is owned  and operated  by a family,  milking  
140 cows on 100 hectares  and using  0.6 tonne  of concentrates  to yield 4,600  
litres worth  $ A 1,300  per cow per year. After  expenses  the typical  net income  
is around  $A50,000.
Target 10 has a big impact  on this final figure.
Target  10
The Target  10 story is not about  new technology.  Rather,  it is about  a new 
approach,  a change  in philosophy,  a loss of arrogance,  a strong  focus  on industry  
needs and teamwork.
A number  of factors  combined  in 1990  to stimulate  the development  of this 
project.
Government  provided  extension  was threatened  
Milk prices  turned  down
There  was a drive by industry  to limit the impact  - leading  to a focus on 
lower  cost of production
Extension  staff were trained  in market  research  techniques  
Recognition of the need  to justify  the effectiveness  of extension and influence 
a greater  number  of farmers  in tangible  ways  
Need for industry  funding  of extension
Other  extension  models  (e.g. fee for service)  were not successful
Philosophy  change
Marketers  see the defining  of customers ’ needs,  wants  and aspirations  as 
fundamental  to the design  of any product  and the gaining  of customer  support.
46
In adopting  this approach,  we have moved from  the potentially  patronising  and 
arrogant  model  of “supply  push ” to the more inclusive  one of “demand  pull”.
In other  words,  we moved  from deciding  what  was good  for the industry  
to listening  and working  with industry.
Target  10 was established  using  this approach  and over two years  of solid  
groundwork  it gained  strong  industry  support  and goals  were  agreed.  Our staff 
were  active  in this phase  and argued  in favour  of increased  pasture  consumption  
as a key goal.  Although  this goal was accepted,  many others  were  also identified  
by the industry  as important.
The principle  goal of Target  10 has been to increase  pasture  consumption  
by 10% on 50% of Victoria ’s dairy farms within  five years.
Industry  representation
Another  important  component  was the active  involvement  of all the key 
stakeholders  in the industry:
• Farmers
• Service  providers
• Factory  field staff
• Agricultural  consultants
All of these  groups  contributed  through  regional  Target  10 committees,  which  
organise  the project  at a local level, and/or  in project  delivery.
What  is Target  10?
The best way I can illustrate  this is by showing  you a video  (5-6 min) which  
outlines  the principles  of the core component  of Target 10. This grazing  
management  course  aims to increase  pasture  consumption.  Why?  Pasture  
consumption  is an important  profitability  indicator  for Victorian  dairy  farmers.
Has Target  10 worked?
Extension  projects  are notoriously  difficult  to evaluate  because  so many  
external  factors  influence  the end result  and it is very difficult  to quarantine  the 
“treatment”  group  so that comparisons  with the “control ” can be made  validly.
Bennett ’s hierarchy*^'  is a useful  tool for this purpose  as it segregates  the 
process  into seven  steps which  allows  progressive  analysis  of the project  as it 
is implemented  and it evaluates  progress  at each stage:
1. Inputs  5. Knowledge,  Aspirations,  Skills and Abilities
2. Activities  6. Practice  change
3. People  7. End result
4. Reactions
Inputs
In three years the project  has cost approximately  $A6m  and involved  35 
people  full time. The grazing  management  courses  have reached  2786  farmers  
(26%)  (i.e. approximately  $A2,000/farm).
These  resources  are contributed  from  Victorian  State  Government  60%,  Dairy 
Research  Development  Corporation  30% ('/2 dairy  farmer  levies  and 'h Federal  
Government),  and 10% “in kind ” from industry.

Knowledge,  Aspirations,  Skills  and Attitudes
Attending  activities  is one thing, but did anyone  learn anything?
Faced  with a sudden  reduction  in pasture  growth,  participants  suggested  an 
increase  in the rotation  length  as an important  part of their strategy  while  non­
participants  chose  a strategy  relying  on grain supplementation.  This suggests
49
a better  appreciation  of the dynamics  of the grazing system amongst  participants.  
Our evaluation  also indicates:
85% of participants  were motivated  to seek further  information  
60% intended  to change  fodder  conservation  practices  
80% were motivated  to milk more cows  
60% intended  to alter the paddock  subdivision  
93% could identify  where  pasture  waste was occurring
Practice  change
Knowing  what to do is not the same as actually  doing  it.
In a recent  survey  of 205 dairy  farmers,  93% were aware  of Target  10,43%  
had attended  activities  and of those 62% had changed  management  practices  
as a result.
Program  participants  have  changed  grazing  practices, feeding  practices, farm 
subdivision  and fertiliser  use. Consequently  farm performance  has improved.  
Our evaluation  estimates  that participants  involved  in the grazing  management  
courses  discussion  groups  (over  one year) achieved:
14.5%  more pasture  consumed  
2.5% more cows milked  
10.5%  more butterfat  per hectare  
6.6% more butterfat  per cow 
40% less supplement
End result
Economic  evaluations  have been carried  out using these evaluation  data. 
The estimated  internal  rate of return  of the project  investment  is 140 to 150%,  
based upon the grazing  management  component  of the program  only. The 
estimated  Net Present  Value is between  $38 million  and $68 million  and 
benefit:cost  ratio is between  5 and 10 to 1.
It is notable  that if this performance  was compared  to that of companies  of 
the Stock  Exchange  the Target 10 share price would  no doubt  be very high.
Summary  outcomes
In the three  years  to date, 26% of Victorian  dairy farmers  have participated  
in the “core activities ” of Target  10 and many more in the support  activities.
The tangible  benefits  of these  core activities  (pasture  course  and discussion  
groups)  alone  were estimated  at 14% improved  pasture  consumption  and 40% 
less use of concentrates.  This is worth  more than $ 15,000/year.
There  are also many  intangible  benefits  accruing  from Target  10 including:
• A well established  infrastructure  of management  and delivery  of extension  
now exists  throughout  the Victorian dairy  industry as  a result  of the planning,  
development  and delivery  of the project
• Substantial  trust  and respect  is established  and from this a genuine  working  
partnership  exists between  all the parties
• A very high level of commitment  of all parties  in continuing  and further  
developing  the project  for the future
50
• Substantially  increased  participant  confidence  in managing  a more  
productive  system
• Increased  desire  of participants  to learn
Because  of the confidence  gained  by the successful  implementation  of the 
first phase  of the project, the  industry  funding  contribution  has been significantly  
increased  for the next phase.
Future  challenges
While  the Target  10 team can be justifiably  proud  of the progress  to date,  
there are many challenges  ahead:
• Expanding  the number  of farmers  participating  from 30% to 50%
• Improved  and extended  evaluation
• Servicing  the established  groups  and offering  them the next level of 
information  while starting  new groups
• Managing  the Target  10 brand name
• Establishing  true industry  ownership,  responsibility  and accountability
• Improving  project  management  skills
Key success  factors
With the wisdom  of hindsight  we can now see that the establishment  of 
Target  10 was a mixture  of good timing  and good management.  A number  of 
factors  have been very important  in making  the project  possible:
• Urgent  need for change  by industry  and extension  providers
• Philosophy  change  to “demand  pull”
• Focus  on industry  needs
• Broad  industry  involvement
• Excellent  industry  leadership
• Strong  support  from Dairy  Research  Development  Corporation
• Congruent  goals
• Coordinated  team approach  focused  on achieving  outcomes
• Tolerance  and genuine  goodwill
• Confidence  that extension  delivers  tangible  results
• Strong  desire  of industry  to take their future  into their own hands
Conclusion
In presenting  Target  10 to you it has not been my intention  to represent  it 
as an ideal extension  project  or a recipe  that could be adopted  unchanged  by 
the Irish  dairy  industry.  Target  10 has been a significant  success  for the Victorian  
dairy industry  although  there are still many challenges  ahead  of us.
I hope there  may  be something  of use for you in our experiences.  Thank  you 
most sincerely  for the opportunity  to share them with you.

A NATION
Editor, “The Stockman  Grassfarmer ”, Mississippi,  U.S.A.
I come  to you today as “The Ghost  of Christmas  Yet to Come. ” I am here 
to warn  you that the road Irish dairying  is headed  down  leads  to financial  ruin. 
The road I am talking  about is one toward  increased  capitalization.  By 
capitalization,  I mean  anything  that comes  between  the cow and green  pasture.
In North  America,  we’ve been  on the capitalization road since  the late 1950 ’s. 
In fact, we have gone so far down  that road we have dairy cows that are born 
and die and have never  seen a green  pasture  in their whole  life. Many  of you 
assume  this situation  exists  because  we can’t grow  dairy  quality  pasture  in the 
United  States  but this is certainly  not the case.
It is true, because  of our large land mass,  we tend to have a much  greater  
extreme  in temperature  variation  from  winter  to summer  than you do. However,  
we have found  this not to be as great  a problem  as it was formerly  thought  to 
be. In fact by utilizing  New Zealand  grazing  techniques  and autumn-saved  
pasture,  there  are very few areas  of the United  States  where  we cannot  produce  
at least a nine month  grazing  season  and in the lower  third of the country  we 
can graze virtually  year around.  Our problem  is more cultural  than climatic.
Our primary  agricultural  paradigm  has been arable  grain production.  As a 
result,  we tend to be the most  equipment-mad  farmers  on the face of the earth.  
Many  of our farmers  would  milk their cows from the seats of their tractors  if 
they could  do it. A common  attitude  is that pasture  exists solely  to keep you 
from “spitting  into Hell. ” As it is currently  structured  in North  America,  dairying  
has very little  to do with  pasture, or even  cows  and milk.  It is a materials handling 
business.  Feed is hauled  in. Manure  is hauled  out. Mechanization  is thought  to 
be “efficient. ” However,  we have discovered  that efficiency  and profitability  
are very poorly  linked.  In fact, today in some  states,  the return  over all costs  
is less than a dollar  per hundred  pounds  of milk produced.
With an average  capital  investment  of $6000  per cow, at our current  milk 
prices  the average  American  dairyman  would  double  his return  on capital  if he 
sold out, put his money  in a Government  long-term  bond and just went  fishing.  
While  some  Irish dairymen  would  argue  that the capital  investment  per cow is 
about  the same in Ireland  due to your much higher  priced  land, I assure  you 
it is not the same.  Investing in a non-depreciating  asset  such  as land is far different  
than putting  your  money  in buildings  that deteriorate  and machinery  that wears  
out and must constantly  be repaired  and replaced.  Today,  most American  
dairymen  can’t sell their farms  for anywhere  near the investment  they have in 
them.  In the majority  of cases  when  it comes  time to sell,  farm “improvements ” 
are valued  at zero and only the underlying  land has any worth  at all.
Capitalization  creates  a situation  where  the young cannot  get in and the old 
cannot  get out. On average  our dairymen  are twice the age of New Zealand ’s 
dairymen.  We are seeing  older  dairymen  who have poured  a lifetime  of blood
52
and money  into concrete  and silos,  barns  and tractors,  and when  they reach  the 
end of their  productive  lives find they have accumulated  nothing.  Their  whole  
life’s work has been lost to rust, rot and depreciation.
Also, capitalization  is terribly  skewed  against  the smaller  dairymen.  If an 
industry  is built around  materials  handling,  the man with the biggest  shovel  
always wins. Whatever  size you are is never  big enough  because  there  is always  
someone  able to buy an even bigger  shovel  than yours.  We now have highly-  
capitalized  dairies  in Florida  with  4000  to 6000  cows  losing  money.  What  hope  
is there for a man with 40 cows under  such a scenario?
How  did this happen?  Why  did our dairymen  lose all sense  of cost control?  
It happened  because  the American  dairyman  put his faith in the politicians.  It 
was the dairyman ’s belief  that no matter  how deep a hole he dug for himself,  
the government  would  come  pull him out of it. Dairymen  fell victim  to what  
we call the “rich kid syndrome. ” In America,  it is said that the most  dangerous  
and irresponsible  person  is a rich man ’s kid. He knows  that no matter  what kind  
of trouble  he gets himself  into, his Dad will bail him out of it. For several  
decades,  the American  dairyman  just totalled  up the cost of all of his newest  
boy-toys  (machinery)  and took it to Congress  who then pegged  the price of 
milk high enough  to pay for them.
Unfortunately,  if we subsidize  anything  at a price higher  than break-even  
it always  produces  a surplus  and that soon happened.  Soon  America  was awash  
with butter  and cheese. It was hard not  to notice  that dairymen  were  only .0005% 
of the American  population  and vote.
So, our Congress  called  a new deal. Dairy would  be subsidized  only at a 
price below  the average  cost of production.  In other words,  the dairyman ’s 
guaranteed  milk  price  would  fall in response  to the amount  of surplus  production  
the government  had to buy. For the dairyman,  this in effect  provided  an umbrella  
only so long as it didn ’t rain. During  the 1990 ’s the support  price fell from  
nearly  what yours is today to what is, in effect,  the world  price. Today,  even  
this minimal  support  level is to be phased  out over the next seven years and 
we are now going to a free-market  system  for all of American  agriculture.
In other  words,  the American  dairyman  will soon have  to live or die selling  
at the same price level as New Zealand  and Australia,  but with a production  
cost structure  that is nearly  double  Ireland ’s. As the editor  of a magazine  called  
The Grass  Farmer,  I would  like to be able to tell you the American  dairyman  
has finally  come to his senses  and now realizes  a pastured  cow gathering  its 
own feed and spreading  its own manure  is the lowest  cost method  of producing  
milk.  Unfortunately,  this is not true. The average  American  dairyman  is in acute  
denial.  In a time  when  you would  expect  rapid  change,  most arejust  hunkering  
down in hopes  someone  else, somewhere  else, will come  to their rescue.  It is 
a law of physics  and human  nature  that people  prefer  to keep going in the 
direction  they are headed  - even if it leads off a cliff.
It is true that about 10% of American  dairy producers  are actively  trying  to 
shift back to pastured  dairying,  but we are finding  that the dairy  skills  and cow 
genetics  that work  well in confinement  dairying  are poorly  suited  for a pasture-  
based  dairy.  For maximum  profitability  a pasture-based  dairy  has to be designed
53
from the ground  up as a pasture-based  dairy.  Everything  has to be in sync with 
the pasture.  This particularly  applies  to cow size and breeding.  We have been  
unable  to find an easy way to return to a grass-based  dairy from a highly  
capitalized,  confinement  dairy  situation.  It appears  that bankruptcy  and starting  
over is by far the quickest  and perhaps  the least painful.
The old political  observation  that those who lead the revolution  are never  
the ones  who lead the counter-revolution  appears  to be true in our dairy  industry  
about-face  as well. We are starting  to see a parallel,  low-capital-input,  pasture-  
based  dairy  industry  develop  from  people  who were never  invested  in the high-  
capital  paradigm.  This  trend  is largely  being  driven  by New  Zealand  management  
in combination with non-agricultural  capital.  These  people  are primarily  attracted  
by the very high return-on-investment  numbers  produced  by grass  dairying  in 
the United States.  Today,  a minimally  capitalized  grass  dairy in the long-growing  
season  regions  of the United  States  can return a profit on its total capital  
investment  in excess  of 35% per annum.  This high return  is primarily  because  
of the very low cost of land in much  of the United  States.
Many  of these investor  dairies  are being designed  along the share-milker  
lines  of New  Zealand  and I believe  this is very healthy.  In a share-milker  situation, 
a young  man can get in and with nothing  but sweat  equity,  own a farm by the 
time he is 35, and retire  by the time  he is 50.1 believe  that is absolutely  essential  
that an industry  provide  a career  path  for the young  and an exit path  for the old  
for it be to competitive.
Now, what does this have to do with you here in Ireland?  I know this is 
going  to sound  very chauvinistic,  but you are tied to the United  States  economy  
with a very short chain.  As the world ’s largest  economy,  when we decide  to 
change  direction  we drag the rest of the world  with us. You have all read about  
the huge restructuring  our economy  is going through  with huge cutbacks  in 
government  expenditures,  massive  layoffs  and wage  deflation. Europe  will soon 
go through  this as well. If we balance  our budget,  you will have to balance  
yours  to protect  your  currency.  If we go to a free and un-subsidized  agriculture,  
you will have to do so as well or your manufactured  products  will be frozen  
out of the loop  of world  trade.  I know most  of you don’t believe  this will happen.
Erom  my previous  visits  to Ireland,  it appears  that most  Irish  dairymen  believe  
that the way it is today  is the way it will be tomorrow. As one Irish dairy  leader  
told me, “I just cannot  believe  we will be abandoned  by Europe. ” I understand  
this feeling.  It would  take an extraordinary  person  to believe  that in the midst  
of a European  dairy  boom,  today ’s price  levels  and quotas  might  soon end.  But, 
they will.
I should  warn you that it was our experience  that politicians  do not like to 
forecast  bad news even when they know it is inevitable.  They prefer  to wait 
until there is some  fiscal “crisis ” and then spring  forth a plan they have been 
working  on in secrecy  for years. I suspect  the same will be true in Europe.  
When  your quota  system  ends, it will end quickly  and without  warning.  Our 
pasture-based  dairymen  are trying to mesh the best of the world ’s pasture  
varieties,  grazing  techniques  and genetics  with our harsh  and varied  climate  to 
come up with American  prototypes  that can increase  profits  in a lower  milk
54
price world.  You need to do the same. I urge you to stop going  to high cost 
countries  to study dairying  and to start going  to New Zealand,  Australia  and 
other  low cost producer  countries  in the southern  Hemisphere.  We can always  
learn a profitable  lesson  from  studying  a farmer  who  is selling  on a lower  price  
schedule  than ourselves.
For example,  because  Ireland  is a lower-cost  milk producer  than the United  
States,  we Americans  are coming  here to study  your methods  and have found  
a lot of good ideas here. It is said an idea is the only thing that if I give you 
mine and you give me yours we both leave with twice  as much as we came.  
I have no doubt  that in a few years  you will find the United  States  a good  source  
for low-cost,  pasture-based  dairying  ideas you can use in Ireland.
The end of subsidies  in the United  States  and Europe  will cause  the world  
price of grain to rise. This will greatly  increase  the value  of pasture.  The Irish 
dairy industry,  as it is currently  structured,  is the lowest-cost  dairy producer  in 
the Northern  Hemisphere  and is still predominantly  pasture-based.  As a result,  
you stand to benefit  more from  world  trade  liberalization  and from  higher  grain  
prices  than any country  north of the Equator.  Ireland  could  be, should  be, the 
cream  pitcher  of Europe.
In conclusion,  I would  urge all of you to take a very serious  look before  you 
leap into increased  capitalization.  Today ’s milk  price  is unlikely  to be tomorrow ’s 
and the road back from capitalization  is very steep and difficult.  Keep Ireland  
green,  pasture-based  and low-cost  and your future  will be a prosperous  one.

Dairy  Policy  Alternatives

This part of the study  provides  estimates  of the effects  of policies  on dairy  
markets  and is divided  into two sections  on the basis of time scale. Section  I 
deals with the period  of the GATT  Uruguay  Round  1995-2001  while Section  
II deals with the longer  term when  the possibility  of ultimate  free trade has to 
be considered.
In evaluating  policy  alternatives,  an economic  model of EU/world  dairy  
markets  was used to provide  estimates  of market  prices,  output,  trade  and gross  
revenue.  The estimates  were based  on a wide range  of assumptions,  including  
long term growth  rates in EU/world  consumer  demand  and milk supply,  
responsiveness  of consumers  and producers  to changing  prices,  rates  of decline  
in EU export  refunds  and internal  subsidies,  and increasing  productivity  in milk 
production.  However,  fluctuations  in exchange  rates or changes  in exchange  
rate regimes  were not considered  in the analysis.  While  results  for many  
alternative  sets of assumptions  were  estimated,  just one sample  of results  based  
on a “plausible ” set of assumptions  is presented. It should  be noted  that  providing  
estimates  of future  prices  and quantities  is an extremely  hazardous  exercise,  
however  it is hoped  that the economic  model at least provides  a concrete  
framework  for discussion,  even if the actual  estimates  turn out to be incorrect.
1995 - 2001
The key policy  questions  for Section  I (1995-2001)  are the identification  
of the most appropriate  EU response  to the GATT  Uruguay  round and the 
desirability  of introducing  B quotas  in the period  before  2001.  Estimates  were  
made of the impact  of the Uruguay  round when the full consequences  take 
effect  in its final year. The GATT  Uruguay  Round  involves  (a) increased  EU 
market  access;  (b) reduced  subsidised  exports;  and (c) a switch  from variable  
import  levies to fixed tariffs and their general  reduction.  Unless  there is 
exceptional  growth  in EU demand  for dairy products  in the EU by Year 2000, 
the combined  effects  of (a) and (b) are estimated  to be equivalent  to an increase  
of close to 4% in milk supplies  in the EU or about 4 million  tonnes.  Three  
policy  responses  were considered:
(a) Combined  Quota/Price  Adjustment:  a 2% quota reduction,  as per CAP  
reform,  combined  with a price reduction  to clear the internal  market.
(b) A price reduction  only, leaving  quotas  unchanged.
(c) A quota  reduction  only (-4%),  leaving  price unchanged.
It was estimated  that a 2% quota  cut by Year 2001 to accommodate  the 
volume  transfer  would  need to be combined  with an internal  price reduction  
of about  8% in order  to clear  the EU internal  market.  Alternatively  if there was
56
no quota  cut, an estimated  EU price  reduction  of about 16% would  be required  
for market  clearance.  The third alternative  of leaving  prices  unchanged  and 
relying  on quota  cuts would  result  in quota  reductions  of about  4% for market  
balance.
With regard  to Irish dairying,  the effect  of these three policy  alternatives  
clearly  shows  that quota  cuts rather  than price reductions  minimise  revenue  
loss to the dairy industry  (Table 1). These  estimates  depend  crucially  on the 
assumption  made regarding  the responsiveness  of EU consumers  and the 
distribution  sector  to lower  prices  at manufacturing  level. In practice,  the two 
policy  extremes  of exclusive  quota  or price cuts are perhaps  least likely,  and 
indeed  optimists  observing  the 1995 market  buoyancy  may hope that such 
buoyancy  will continue  through  to 2001 and perhaps  obviate  the need for any 
cuts.
The factor  with the  most  fundamental  long term consequences  in the GATT 
Uruguay  round  was the switch  from variable  import  levies  to fixed tariffs  and 
their reduction  by 36% for most products.  In the short term however,  to 2001,  
the effect  should  be very limited  due to the choice  of a very favourable  base 
period  for estimation  of initial fixed tariffs  (1986-88).
The B Quota  Proposal
The B Quota,  as described  by the Danish  Dairy  Board, DDB  (1994) involves  
the production  of
“certain  limited  quantities  in excess  of the A Quota  (present  quota),  without  
triggering any supplementary levy,  if exported  without  subsidies.  The volume  
of B quota milk can be adapted  to the market  potential.  As a minimum,  
access  to volume  securing  the present  position  of the EU on the world  market  
should  be opened  up. This will mean a B quota  volume  corresponding  to 
2-5% of the present  EU milk production ”.
Given  that the increase  in import  access  and reduced  subsidised  exports  
under  GATT  has been earlier  estimated  to be  equivalent  to a net 4 million tonnes  
addition  to the EU market,  and that EU policy  options  discussed  earlier  include  
a 4% quota  cut, or a 2% cut combined  with a price  cut, it seems  reasonable  to 
consider  a limited  number  of B quota  volumes  as follows:
(a) minus  2% A Quota  replaced  by 2% B Quota
(b) minus  2% A Quota  replaced  by 4% B Quota
(c) minus  2% A Quota  replaced  by 6% B Quota
(d) minus  4% A Quota  replaced  by 4% B Quota
(e) minus  4% A Quota  replaced  by 6% B Quota.
As B Quotas  would  be sold solely  on the world  market,  their  primary'  effect  
is on world  market  prices  and quantities,  with  of course secondary consequences  
for the internal  EU market.  Given  fixed tariffs  under  GATT,  the level of world  
market  prices is crucial  in determining  whether  B quotas,  which will lower  
world  market  prices,  would  also force  EU internal  support  prices  downwards.  
World  market  prices  fluctuate  very widely,  being  affected  by many supply  and 
demand  factors  and by fluctuating  exchange  rates. The estimated  effects  of B

quotas  inevitably  show  that increasing  levels  of B quotas  lead to lower  world  
market  prices,  an increased  world  market  size due to buyer  response  to lower  
prices,  and an increased  EU world  market  share.
The five B quota  policy  alternatives  would  also have  differing  consequences  
for export  refunds,  degree  of tariff  protection,  dairy  industry  gross  revenue  and 
costs  and GATT  commitments  such  as reducing  budgetary  expenditure  on export  
subsidies  by 36% over six years.  While  estimates  were made  of these various  
effects  at EU level,  this paper  concentrates  on the consequences  for gross  revenue

of Irish dairying.
Under  the assumptions  made, the specific  effects  of the five B quota  
alternatives  on the gross  revenue  of Irish  dairying  range  from +£32 million  to 
+£4 million  (Table  2). (By specific  effect  is meant  the additional  impact  of the 
B quota  per se.) These  values  may seem somewhat  small,  however  a B quota  
of say 4% in Ireland  is little over  40 million  gals which  would  be sold at world 
market  prices,  say around  50p per gal, and 40 million  x £.5 = £20 million.  In 
one case, it was estimated  that the largest  B quota  (+6) would  result  in a lower  
specific  benefit  than a smaller  B quota,  as under  the assumptions  made,  a large 
B quota  would  lower  world market  prices  to such a level that the year 2001
58
tariff  would  not protect  the EU support  price  and, subject  to the GATT  safeguard  
clause,  a support  price reduction  would  ensue.  Combining  the A and B quota  
policy  alternatives,  the best option  emerging  re gross  revenue  was to combine  
a quota  reduction  rather  than a price reduction  on the A quota  with a limited  
B quota  (Table  2).
The overall conclusion  from  the model  calculations  was that B quotas  would  
be positive  for gross  revenue  in Irish dairying,  but their size would  have to be 
limited  at EU level lest they cause  world  market  prices  to fall to levels  which,  
with fixed  tariffs,  would  create  pressures  for reductions  in A quota  support  prices.  
It is also clear  that it would  be desirable  that B quotas  would  be flexible,  given  
the likelihood  of large fluctuations  in world  market  prices  and exchange  rates.
Further  considerations,  including  the timing  of policy  changes,  the possible  
loss of windfall  gains with B quotas,  the risk to the A quota, product  
differentiation,  world  market  shares,  are discussed  in Keane  and Collins  (1995).
Longer  term policy  options
With regard  to longer  term options  post-2000,  the starting  point is 
consideration  of world  agricultural  trade  policy  beyond  the Uruguay  Round.  A 
key component  of the Uruguay  Round  was the establishment  of fixed tariffs  
and their general  reduction  by 36% (S.M.R  by 20%) by the end of the round.  
While the impact  of this may be limited  over  the period  of the Uruguay  Round,  
if it is accepted  that the tariffs  will continue  to be reduced,  then this reduction  
will be a primary  determinant  of EU internal  prices  post-Uruguay  Round,  with 
world market  prices  plus tariffs establishing  an effective  upper  limit to EU 
internal  prices. (The  continuation  of the safeguard  clause  or a market  stabilisation  
scheme  would  be even more important  in any new round.)  Thus the rate of 
tariff  reduction  is crucial.  In order  to conduct  an analysis  some  assumptions  are 
necessary  about  the rate of reduction  and a date for ultimate  free trade.
Assumption  on tariff  reduction
The basis for the assumption  on tariff  reduction  is that the initial tariff  at 
the beginning  of the Uruguay  Round  is equivalent  to about 90p/gal  in Irish 
terms,  and that this is reduced  by up to 36 or to 60p/gal  at the end of the round,  
a reduction  of about 30p. Given  the reduction  in tariffs  of 30p in the 1990s  
under  the Uruguay  Round,  it is initially  assumed  that the remaining  60p  approx,  
equivalent  tariff  is eliminated  in two subsequent  trade rounds,  resulting  in free 
trade in 2020. The assumption  envisages:
(a) a trade round  over the period  2001 to 2010  (WTO  I) in which  the tariff  is 
reduced  from 60p to 30p equivalent.  This might involve  a period  of 
negotiation  2000 - 2003, and a period  of implementation  2004 - 2010.
(b) a trade round in 2010 - 2020 replicating  the above  with free trade at the 
end.
The policy  alternatives  considered  were;
• continuation  of quotas  with reducing  tariff  protection  until free trade  in 2020
• abandonment  of quotas  with reducing tariff  protection  until free trade  in 2020.
59
Again  many alternative  sets of assumptions  were considered  with results  
below  confined  to one “plausible ” set. The assumptions  cover  a wide range,  
such as growth  in EU and world  demand  and in EU and world  supply,  gradual  
reductions  in EU internal  and export  subsidies,  responsiveness  of EU and world  
producers  and consumers  to price change,  etc.
Results
Results  for Part II are presented  in the form  of percentage  changes  in price,  
output  and gross revenue  from the base year at overall  EU level. Taking  the 
initial  set of assumptions,  the results  show  that with a continuation  of quotas,  
EU prices  would  fall by about 10% in the first decade  and by a further  10% 
approximately  in the second  decade  to free trade (Table  3). With quotas  
unchanged,  estimated  gross revenue  for dairying  (farm plus manufacturing)  
would  also fall by about 20% over this period.

If quotas  were abandoned,  estimated  EU output  would  expand  and, with 
fixed tariffs,  prices  would  be correspondingly  lower.  Initial  estimates  indicate  
a fall in price of about  20% in the first decade  and a further  10% in the next 
decade  or about  30% overall  (Table  3). Estimated  EU output  however  would  
rise by close  to 15% in the first decade  and tend to increase  much  more  modestly  
subsequently  as producers  react to lower prices.  In terms of gross industry  
revenue  (farm  plus manufacturing),  the estimates  without  quotas  involve  a fall 
of about 20% over tbe two decades,  which is almost  identical  with that for 
retention  of quotas  (Table  3). Gross  revenue  estimates  with the abandonment  
of quotas  obviously  involve  lower  prices  being  multiplied  by higher  volumes,  
giving  the almost  identical  results  shown.
Profits  from dairying  depend  on costs and likely  compensation  payments,  
as well as on gross revenue.  In the above  comparison  the higher  output  with 
the abandonment  of quotas  inevitably  involves  higher  costs,  so that profit  would  
be lower  if quotas  are abandoned.  However  levels  of compensation  payments  
may also be a factor. These  issues  are not further  discussed  in this part of study.
While  one might  conclude  from the above  that there is a case for long-term
60
retention of quotas,  there  are strong  counter  arguments  favouring  abandonment  
of quotas,  or at least modification  of the current  rigid quota  regime,  at some  
point  before  free trade.  Firstly  retention  of quotas  would  mean  that Ireland/EU  
would  have  a smaller,  weaker  and less competitive  dairy industry  on entry into 
the free trade  era. The benefits  of economies  of scale would  not be fully achieved,  
the share  of the world  market  would  be lower  and dairy companies  supplying  
Irish products  would  thus have fewer  established  market  positions  in the free 
trade era.
The position  of Ireland  relative  to the remainder  of the EU if quotas  were  
abandoned  must  also be considered.  Given  the generally  lower  production  cost 
base, as shown  by Fingleton  (1995),  it is reasonable  to assume  that, with no 
quotas,  Irish  output  would  grow  at a more  rapid  rate than the EU average.  Thus,  
taking the above  estimates,  gross dairy industry  revenue  for Ireland  would  
probably  be higher  without  quotas  than with retention  of quotas,  given the 
equality  estimate  for the EU as a whole.  (Some  very preliminary  estimates  for 
Ireland  were made under  alternative  assumptions.)
Limited  production  at world  market  prices
Limited  production  at world  market  prices  (B quotas  or suchlike),  side-by-  
side with  the current  A quotas  are a further  alternative  between  the two extremes  
of continuing  A quotas  and unrestricted  output.  Some preliminary  estimates  
were  made  of the effect  of a limited  B quota,  as an alternative  to just an Aquota  
or total abolition  of quotas.  Inevitably,  the producer  pool  price  lies between  the 
two more extreme  policies.
At a more general  level,  a B quota  policy  may have considerable  merit,  as 
it would mean that production  could expand  in a controlled  situation.  
Uncontrolled  abolition  of quotas  could  involve,  for example,  much  higher  EU 
output,  especially  in “good ” years (climatic  etc.). The world  dairy market  is 
fragile,  and if these years coincided  with surges  among  other suppliers  to the 
world  market,  world  prices  could  slump.  A flexible  B quota  regime  could  help 
in avoiding  such problems,  while  at the same  time  permitting  Irish/EU  exporters  
to maintain and  develop  market  positions  in third  countries.  It would also  enable  
Irish/EU  producers  to expand,  gain scale  and technology  benefits,  and directly  
experience  the competitive  forces  associated  with free trade.  This would  help 
to ensure that the generation  of producers  who will  experience  free trade  would  
not inherit  a small,  weak and uncompetitive  industry  in global  terms.
PART  2: The impact  of quota  and price adjustments  on incomes  
from dairying  to year 2000/01
The main objective  of this part of the study is to measure  changes  in the 
net income  from dairying  which  would  result  from specified  changes  in milk 
quota  production and in milk  prices  up to the year  2000/01. Initially the outcomes  
of the changes  were  calculated  excluding  the option of B-quota  milk production  
and subsequently  tbe B-quota  option  was included  in tbe calculations.
The evaluation  model  used to estimate  the net income  changes  arising  from
61
EH'ect  on net income  from  dairying  from quota  and/or  price  changes
due to GATT
Fig. 1 - Production  evaluation  model
quota and price adjustments  is depicted  in Figure 1. It is essentially  a 
representative  farm type model. The specified  price  and/or  volume  adjustments  
were applied  to the relevant  components  of the outputs  and inputs  and the 
resultant  net income  from the  dairying  activity  was then calculated. The change  
in income  from  other  enterprises  was independently  calculated  and included  in 
the net income  change  for the dairying  activity.
Only  explicit  costs,  as conventionally  measured in the National  Farm  Survey,  
are included  in the cost estimates  and thus imputed  charges  for family  labour, 
owned  land or other ‘owned ’ capital  invested  in the farm business  are omitted.  
Total costs,  as indicated  in Figure  1, are defined  as the sum of direct  costs  and
62
overhead  costs.  Lower  unit costs  of milk  production arising  from the  expectation  
of lower  milk prices  in the future,  or the ability  to avail of the possible  option  
to produce  B-quota  milk, will be strongly  influenced  by the level of unit 
production  costs on any particular  dairy farm.
Initially  a number  of scenarios  were explored  for milk quota  and/or  milk 
price changes  which  may be required  to satisfy  GATT  commitments  by the 
year 2000/01,  without  including  the B-quota  option.  Base year productivity  
and efficiency  relationships  were assumed  to remain  unchanged.  These  
assumptions  and adjustments  to them are discussed  later.
The outcome  of changes  in net income  were calculated  for the following  
scenarios:
51 A quota  cut of 4%
52 A price cut of 16%
53 A quota  cut of 2% combined  with a price cut of 8%
54 A quota  cut of 4% combined  with a price cut of 10%
The basis for the first three scenarios  has been briefly  discussed  earlier  in 
Part 1. The fourth  scenario  is the published  expectation  from a study by the 
Danish  Dairy  Board  of the adjustments  required  in EU quotas  milk prices  to 
meet the terms  of the GATT  Uruguay  Round  by the end of the period  covered  
by the agreement.  Of the four scenarios,  the authors  consider  the combination  
of a 2% quota  and a price of 8% to be closest  to the expected  final outturn.
The resultant  effects  on net income  compared  with  the base year  for the four 
scenarios are  shown  in Table  4 for ‘all herds, ’ ‘larger  herds ’ and ‘smaller  herds. ’ 
Dealing  with ‘all herds ’ first, the least damaging  adjustment  to net income  is 
that under  SI, which  results  in a 5% fall in net income.  Relying  on a price cut 
only of 16% (S2) would  cause  the largest  drop in net income  from dairying  
(-33%).  The Danish  expectation  (S4) would  cause  net income  to fall by 25% 
whilst  the ‘more likely ’ 2% quota  cut combined  with an 8% price cut would  
result in the net income  decline  of about 19%.
The same  calculations,  for the four scenarios  as specified,  were  also carried  
out for specialised  dairy  farms  with smaller  herds  (10-30  cows)  and with larger

herds  (60 cows  +). The resultant  changes  to net incomes  were not substantially  
different  for each  scenario  compared  to the results  discussed  above  for ‘all farms ’ 
(Table  4). There  was a tendency  for larger  herds to show marginally  greater  
income  reductions  where  price cuts were included  in the scenario  specified.
Effects  on net incomes  including  the B-quota  option
The B-milk  quota  option  as proposed  by the Danish  Dairy Board was 
described  in Part 1. The most critical  questions  at farm level to be answered,  
if B-milk  quotas  were available,  concern  the producer  price expectations  for 
B-milk  and the effect  on basic  A-quota  prices,  if any, of varying  amounts  of 
EU dairy product  exports  derived  from B-milk  production.  Using  the results  
from the economic  model  (see Part 1), the alternative  quota  and price  changes  
were defined  as follows:
Alternative  1: 2% A-quota  cut replaced  by 2% B-quota  and A-quota  price  
reduced  by 8% with a B milk price of 54 pence  per gallon.  
Alternative  2: 2% A-quota  cut replaced  by 4% B-quota  and A-quota  price  
reduced  by 8% with a B milk price of 50 pence  per gallon.  
Alternative  3: 2% A-quota  cut replaced  by 6% B-quota  and A-quota  price  
reduced  by 8% with a B milk price of 46 pence  per gallon.  
Alternative  4: 4% A-quota  cut replaced  by 4% B-quota  and no change  in 
A-quota  price with a B milk price of 50 pence  per gallon.  
Alternative  5: 4% A-quota  cut replaced  by 6% B-quota  and A-quota  price  
reduced  by 3% with a B milk price of 46 pence  per gallon.  
Changes  to dairying  net incomes  for the five alternatives,  including  B-milk  
production,  are shown in Table  5. The first three  alternatives  result in very similar  
changes. In all three  cases, the reduction  in net incomes is close  to 18% compared  
to the base situation.  Alternative  4 gives  the best result,  where  no change  in A- 
quota  price  is anticipated  due to a 4%  cut in A-quota,  which  in turn is replaced  
fully by a 4% B-quota.  The decline  in net income  is limited  to 4% of the base

net income. In the final alternative  (5), as a 4% cut in quota  is more  than replaced  
by a 6% B-quota,  the A-quota  price is forced  down to maintain  EU tariff  
protection  against  imports.  This, together  with the lower  B milk price from 
world markets,  results  in a net income  reduction  of 10% overall.  Also, it is 
shown  in Table  2 that there  are only marginal  differences  between  the changes  
in net incomes  for smaller,  larger  and all herds  groupings  with regard  to each 
specified  alternative  that includes  the B-quota  option.
Which  dairy  farms  could  produce  B-milk  quota?
This question  can be answered  by reference  to the unit costs of milk  
production  as shown  in Figures  2a, 2b and 2c. Where  the quantity  of B-quota  
produced  is relatively  low, and no additional  overhead  costs  are incurred,  then 
virtually  all milk producers  could participate  in the production  of B-milk.  
However,  for up to 25% of dairy farms  with direct  costs above  36 pence  per 
gallon  (see Fig. 2b) it may be more  remunerative  to forego  B-milk  production  
in favour  of an alternative  farm enterprise,  especially  if EU production  of B- 
milk is 6% or more of the total EU milk quota.  As the proportion  of B-milk  
is increased  on individual  farms,  additional  overhead  costs  will be incurred,  so 
that eventually  the level of total costs per gallon  as shown  in Figure  2a will 
apply.  In this situation  only the most cost- efficient  farms,  probably  not more  
than 15% of all farms,  may find it feasible  to produce  B-quota  milk. Even on 
the more cost-efficient  farms, it would  be advisable  to assess  whether  the 
resources  employed  in B-milk  production  could  be more  profitably  used in an 
alternative  farm enterprise  .
66
The B-milk  price available  to the producer  will be critically  dependent  on 
whether  the EU level of B-milk  is produced  only  for unsubsidised  dairy product  
exports,  and whether  the amount  of B-milk  purchased  by an individual  milk 
processor  will incur only marginal  processing  costs or something  more.  
Therefore,  the proportion  of Irish dairy farmers  which  could  participate  in B- 
milk production  will be estimated  with  greater  confidence  when  the EU B-milk  
production  possibilities  are more clearly  established,  and when the milk  
processors  are able to clarify  tbeir additional  product  costs.
Estimated  changes  in aggregate  net income  from  dairying
An attempt  was been made  to calculate  the aggregate  change  in net income  
from dairying  for each of the four scenarios  and five alternatives  (with  the B- 
quota option)  outlined  earlier.  The assumption  was made that the effects  of 
price and quota  changes,  as determined  for specialist  dairy farms,  would  on 
average  be the same  for those  farms  with milk  production  which  were  excluded  
from  the base  representative  sample.  The  estimated  aggregate  net income  changes  
for the four scenarios  and five alternatives  are shown  in Table  6. These  changes  
reflect  not only  the volume  and price  changes  in the types  of milk  quota  produced  
(A and B),  but also include  adjustments  both to costs  of milk  production,  where  
appropriate,  and to the net income  from other farm enterprises  when quotas  
produced  exceed  or fall short of the base period.

Alternative  4 - 21

Note: See text for specifications  of various  scenarios  and alternatives
Clearly the most  favourable  outcome,  excluding  the B-quota  option,  is where  
a 4% cut in the basic quota,  without  price  cuts,  satisfies  the commitments  under  
GATT.  This  gives  a reduction  of IR£24  million  relative  to the base year. Relying  
totally  on a price  cut results  in a massive  reduction  of IR£ 167 million in aggregate  
net income.  The two combinations  of quota  and price  cuts specified  also result  
in relatively  large reductions  in aggregate  net income  of IRf96  million  for 
Scenario  3, and IR£124  million  for Scenario  4.
67
When  the Scenario  3 specification  is combined  with B-quota  options  of 2%, 
4% and 6% in Alternatives  1, 2 and 3, respectively,  the reduction  in aggregate  
net income  is slightly  reduced.  There  is little difference  between  the outcomes  
for the first  three  alternatives, with  Alternative  2, a marginally  more  advantageous 
option  where  a 2% cut in A-quota  is replaced  by a 4% B-quota.
Alternative  4 gives  the best overall  result,  where  no price  reduction  applies  
to A-quota  and the 4% cut in B-quota  is matched  by a 4% B-quota  option.  The 
loss in aggregate  net income  is only IR£21  million.  Under  Alternative  5, where  
a 4% in A-quota  is replaced  by an increased  level of B-quota  of 6%, the loss 
in aggregate  net income  is substantially  higher,  at an estimated  IR£50  million.  
This  again  underlines  the extremely  adverse  effects  on net income  from  dairying,  
both at farm level and in the aggregate  when the price of the basic quota is 
reduced.
OTHER  ISSUES  FOR CONSIDERATION
(a) Productivity  gains  and cost efficiency
The results  presented  with regard  to income  changes  from adjustments  to 
quotas  and milk prices were based on the assumption  that base year 
productivity  and efficiency  relationships  remained  constant,  i.e., at base 
year levels.  In practice  this assumption  is unlikely  to hold over time. It is 
normally  the case  that farmers  who want  to maintain  their  real income  levels  
and survive  in farming  must  achieve  growth  in their businesses  over time. 
An ability  to increase  productivity  on dairy farms  will be needed  to offset  
or negate  the reductions  in net incomes  set out earlier.
To demonstrate  the relevance  of productivity  gains in relation  to the 
maintenance  of incomes,  the effects  on net incomes  of three achievable  
rates of productivity  growth  are shown  in Table  7. The three growth  rates  
of 1%, 1.5% and 2.0% were applied  only to a selected  number  of the quota  
and price  change  alternatives  evaluated  earlier.  It should  also be noted  that 
a specific  increase  in input  prices  was included  in the calculations  (see note 
with Table  7).
Table  7

scenarios  and alternatives  of quota  and milk price changes.*

Scenario  2 -17 -9 -1
Alternative  2 -15 -7 -1- 2
Alternative  4 -1 -1-8 ^r\l
Alternative  5 -7 -1-2 -1-1 1
* In the calculations  are expectations  that total costs,  with the exception  of purchased  
concentrates,  will grow  by 2% per annum  over  the period. The scenarios  and alternatives  
selected  are as specified  earlier.
68
Achieving  the lower  growth  rate of 1% per annum  in productivity  would  
not make  major  inroads  towards  removing  the negative  effects  on income  
from the GATT;  gains  of 1.5% to 2%  are seen as necessary  to maintain  real 
incomes  on dairy farms.
On many  dairy farms  there is substantial  scope  to reduce  the unit costs of 
milk production  and in these situations  incomes  may be more effectively  
protected  through  pursuing  cost efficiency  measures. On the  basis  of current  
input-output  relationships  on dairy  farms, a reduction  of one penny  per gallon  
in milk production  costs would  result  in about  a 2% increase  in net income  
from dairying.
(b) Compensation  for price cuts
In the results  shown  earlier  in Tables  4 and 5, the most negative  effects  on 
net income  were always  due to a reduction  in the price  of basic (A) quota  
milk. Given  the outcome  of CAP  reform  for other  farm products,  it seems  
legitimate  to expect  that compensatory  payments  would  also be made for 
income  loss arising  from price reductions  needed  to fulfil GATT  
commitments.  If this were to apply, it would  probably  enhance  the 
introduction  of a small but flexible  level of EU B milk production.
(c) Quota  asset values
Milk quotas  have currently  acquired  very significant  asset values.  The 
introduction  of B-milk  quota  to replace  a reduction  in A-quota  milk would  
almost  certainly  diminish  the asset values  of standard  quotas.  In general,  
this would  be advantageous  to milk producers  who intend to continue  long­
term in dairying.  Under  the present  system,  capital  is being  continuously  
drained  from dairy  farming  and anyone  expanding  in, or planning  to enter, 
milk production  has to carry a major  additional  financial  burden  when  
acquiring  milk production  rights.
(d) Competing  for B-quota  production  with other  EU countries
A close  examination  of the Danish  B-quota  proposal  suggests  that if the B- 
quota  option  was introduced  by the EU, the distribution  of B-quota  rights  
would  not necessarily  be directly  proportionate  to the current  national  
distribution  of the EU milk quota.  The Danish  preference  is for B-quota  to 
be distributed  ‘according  to historic  export  quantities  with refunds ’ under  
‘an EU-based  license  system’ . On this basis,  potential  allocations  to certain  
EU countries  would  be very limited.
If on the other hand,  the option  to produce  B-milk  was freely available  to 
dairy farmers  in all EU countries,  the question  of which  country ’s milk 
producers  would be best able to compete  for B-milk  production  rights would  
be strongly  influenced  by comparative  production  costs.  The results  of a 
recent  study  on the comparative  costs of milk production  in EU countries,  
indicate  that Irish dairy farmers  produce  milk at the lowest  average  cost,  
apart from Belgian  milk producers,  Fingleton  (1995).  Even  when  the higher  
milk prices  to other EU producers  were taken into account,  the unit net 
margins  from  Irish milk  production  were  still very favourable  in comparative  
terms.

Conclusions
• A number  of policy  alternatives  were evaluated  to determine  the most  
appropriate  response  to the GATT  Uruguay  Round  and the desirability  of 
introducing  B milk  quotas.  A required  quota  reduction  of up to 4% on its own 
to meet  GATT  commitments  would  best maintain  dairy  industry  gross  revenue 
whilst  using  price  reductions  only  (-16%)  would  seriously  erode  gross  revenues 
in the Irish dairy industry.
• It was shown  that from  an industry  point  of view  there  should  be some  scope  
for B milk quotas  in the EU provided  the quantity  allowed  was limited  and 
flexible  with respect  to world market  conditions.
• In regard  to longer  term dairy policy  alternatives,  the retention  of quotas  
would  lead to lower  reductions  in prices  compared  with the abandonment  of 
quotas.  But if quotas  were abandoned,  milk production  would  increase  and, 
as a result,  the gross revenue  of the dairy industry  could  be very similar  to 
that under  a continuation  of quotas.
• If, as was assumed,  future  world  trade  agreements  will ultimately  lead to free 
trade in dairy  products  then the abandonment  of quotas,  at some  stage,  may 
be necessary  to promote  a stronger  and more competitive  dairy industry  to 
meet that challenge.  In this situation,  the production  of B-milk  quotas,  in a 
controlled  and flexible  way, could thus play a valuable  transitional  role.
• To meet GATT  commitments,  net incomes  from dairying  would  be better  
protected  through  quotas  cuts rather  than price reductions.
• The B-quota  option  could be marginally  beneficial  in terms of net dairy  
incomes.  But the quantity  of B-milk  production  must be limited  so that the 
price of A quota  is not adversely  affected.
• Most  Irish dairy  farmers  could  participate  in B-quota  production  if relatively  
low quantities  are involved  but only a minority  of cost efficient  producers  
could consider  B-quotas  if additional  overhead  costs are incurred.
• Productivity  gains  in excess  of 1.5%  per annum  would  be required  to maintain 
net incomes  from dairying  in the medium  term.  Assuming  a continuation  of 
quotas,  more efficient  use of inputs  may provide  the best strategy  towards  
achieving  such gains.
• The results  shown  in the body of this paper  were derived  from inputting  the 
‘most  plausible ’ set of assumptions  into a relatively  simple  economic  model 
and therefore  results  are sensitive  to changes  in these  assumptions.  The authors 
also recognise  that many other issues need to be researched  which  would  
bring  greater  clarity  to debating  and selecting  the most  desirable  policy  options 
to pursue  in the best interests  of all involved  in the Irish dairy sector.
The authors  wish to acknowledge  the generous  support  received  from the Irish Dairy
Board  and also the  contribution  made  by Irish  dairy  farmers  from the Dairy  Levy  Fund.

Production  Performance  on Dairy  Farms  
in Relation  to Milk Quotas

Introduction
The profitability  of dairy fanning  is affected,  not just by prices and unit 
costs, but also by the amount  and structure  of inputs used, their technical  
productivity,  and the physical  output  levels  attained.  This aspect  of the farm  
business  should  have been particularly  relevant  in the quota era, since the 
constraints  on production  should  have  focused  attention much  more  on technical  
aspects  of resource  use and on finding  the most  efficient  structure  of inputs  to 
produce  the permitted  output.  Dairy  farmers  in Ireland  have been exposed  to 
the quota  system  for over a decade  now. The major  realignments  which  were  
necessary to work  in this new  reality  should  have  been made  for some  time  now 
on farms.  In this paper,  the economic  returns  from  Dairying  using  the Moorepark  
Blueprint  for efficient  milk production  are presented.  The focus is on systems  
of production  based  on spring-calving.  The performance  on commercial  dairy  
farms  was also  considered  to see whether  this optimum  system  of milk  production  
is evident  on commercial  dairy farms.
Current  milk  production  system
Optimum  system  of milk production
The optimum  system  of milk  production  for a given  quota  is not immediately  
obvious.  The shape and place of the production  function,  the return from  
alternative  enterprises  and the costs of feed and other inputs  as well as milk 
price play  a decisive  role. The basis for analysing  economic  optimality  in milk 
production  is the production  function  and the cost function  derived  from the 
production  function.
Figure 1 shows  a typical  cost function  for milk production  with a given  
number  of cows in the herd. The top of the figure shows  the total costs of 
production  (TC) as a function  of milk production.
These  costs can be divided  into three groups:
1) Feed costs,  i.e. costs  which  vary both with feed input  and with the number  
of cows.
2) Other  production  costs,  i.e. costs  which  vary only with the  number  of cows.  
Costs  of breeding,  veterinary  services,  labour  and interest  on the herd  capital  
are examples  of such costs.
3) Fixed  costs,  i.e. costs  which  are fixed  even  if the number  of cows  is reduced.  
These  costs  include  book  interest,  depreciation and maintenance  of buildings  
and machinery.  Whether  these  costs are fixed or not, naturally  depends  on
71
The bottom  part of the figure  shows  the marginal  costs  (MC) and  the average  
production  costs  (APC)  as a function  of milk  production.  The average  production  
costs  are defined  as the sum  of “Feed  costs”  and “Other  production  costs ” divided 
by the milk production.the time horizon.  In the short run, they are fixed costs,  but in the long run
it will be possible  to adjust  these costs to the number  of cows.
72
With a milk price  of and without  any quota  restriction,  the optimal  milk  
production  is Ml. With this amount,  profit  is maximised.
But with a milk quota  Q (Q < Ml) the milk production  has to be reduced.  
This can be done by reducing  feed input  or by reducing  the number  of cows.  
Naturally  a combination  is also possible.  The criterion,  according  to which  a 
given  reduction  should  be carried  out, is that costs should  be reduced  as much  
as possible.  By reducing  feed input, feed costs are reduced.  This reduction  
depends  on the marginal  price  per feed  unit. By selling  cows,  the cow-dependent  
costs (i.e. “Other  production  costs ” including  feed  for those  cows),  are reduced.  
This reduction  depends  on the value of cows (interest)  and the expenses  on 
breeding  and veterinary  services.
Under  the assumption  that all the cows in the herd have the same milk  
production  function  (this is not the case in practice),  the optimal  solution  to the 
problem  is given by the following  adjustment  procedure:  Reduce  feed input  
until the point  where  the average  production  costs (APC)  are at the minimum.  
If further  reduction is necessary,  sell cows  until  the quota  is reached.  The optimal  
adjustment  procedure  is shown  in Figure  2. First the milk production  per cow 
is reduced  from M, to M^. If further  reduction  is necessary,  cows are sold. Of 
course,  if the quota is reached  before  the production  is reduced  to M^, the 
reduction  should  only be carried  out to the point, where  the quota  is reached,  
and no cows will be sold.
The adjustment  procedure  described  so far refers  to short run adjustment.  
The short run is characterised  by the fact that some  of the costs are fixed,  i.e.
73
will not change  even if the number  of cows is reduced.  Capital  costs and 
sometimes  also labour  costs are examples  of such costs. In the long run, it is 
possible  to adjust  these  costs.  Therefore, in the long  run they should  be considered  
as variable  costs,  and should  be taken into account  in calculating  the average  
production  costs.  On the other  hand,  once  the farm  conditions  are adapted  towards  
the new requirements  and the farmer  has to make  decisions  about  next year ’s 
production,  investments  are fixed and costs are therefore  to be seen from the 
short run perspective  again and thus split in fixed and variable  costs.
Current  milk  production  costs
The current  costs of inputs  and current  prices  were applied  to the current  
recommended  milk  production  system  defined  from production  research  taking  
cognisance  of the issues  discussed  above.  The computer  system  incorporating  
these relationships  is called ‘The Dairy Planner ’. This computer  programme  
allows  the returns  from various  production  systems,  including  different  
combinations  of inputs,  to be determined  quickly.  In summary,  this computer  
system  incorporates  all the physical  inputs  of the dairy system  as well as the 
financial  parameters.  This program  was used for much  of the financial  analysis  
in this paper.
Model  farm  used  to determine  the optimum  system  of production
A model  farm was used in this analysis  to determine  the optimum  sysmrn  
of production  under various  scenarios.  This model  farm represents  a typical  
dairy  farming  system  in Ireland  now where milk  quota  is usually  limiting  before  
land and where  there has to be a combination  of enterprises  to use the land 
available.  This allows  the opportunity  cost of capital  to be evaluated  versus  
profitability  of other  farm  production  areas.  The main  assumptions  used for *e 
model  farm are given  in Table 1. The amount  of capital  used varied  depending  
on whether  the quota  or no quota  scenario  was considered.  Capital  was not a 
constraint  as was Quota  and farm size. Capital  did however  influence  the final 
solution  because  different  levels  of capital  were used for the various  systems.

A number  of options  were considered  where  quota  constraints  were applied  
and where  no quota  constraints  were applied.  High milk price and low milk 
price  scenarios  were also considered.  It is argued  that in the short  term,  the two  
milk price levels  chosen  would  not result  in any significant  change  in the current  
recommendations  for milk production.  The effect  of milk price paid to farmers  
on the industry  in the longer  term is outside  the scope of this paper. It was
74
considered  that these were the main driving  components  of the dairy system  
and should  give direction  as to the optimum  system  that should  be adopted  by 
dairy  farmers  depending  on the economic  policy  options  employed.  This  analysis  
is mainly  focused  on the potential  for profit.  It is recognised  that detailed  financial 
analysis  involving  cash  flows,  etc. is needed  before  the ‘good  strategies ’, derived  
from this analysis,  can finally  be adopted  on farms.
Effect  of quota  size on farm  profitability
The effect  of varying  quota size from 25,000  to 50,000  gallons  was 
considered.  The  effect  of quota  size on the increase  in farm  profitability  is shown  
in Figure  3. It has to be recognised  that as the quota  size increases  or decreases,  
the number  of dairy cows and beef animals  also vary.

factors,  such as farm gross  margin per cow,  per acre or per gallon,  are of limited  
use in assessing  the importance  of quota  size. The relative  change  in farm  gross  
margin  was similar  for both the high and the low milk price situation.  The 
relative  change  in farm net margin  is however  different  for the two milk price  
scenarios.  Of particular  importance  is the level of fixed  costs  on the farm. Size 
of quota has also a large influence  on the optimum  proportion  of cows  and beef 
cattle on the farm (or alternative  enterprises).
It is important  to consider  parameters  such as net m.argin  when assessing  
the importance  of factors  such as quota  size. It is recognised,  that fixed costs  
may not be constant  over the range  of quota  size considered  here.  The analysis  
does show, that fixed cost structure  has a very important  effect.
Effect  of leasing  additional  quota
The milk quota  size on the farm has a large influence  on farm profitability,  
as seen in Figure  3. Many  farmers  lease additional  quota  in order  to improve  
farm profitability.  The effect  of leasing  5,000  or 10,000  gallons  of additional  
quota  (@ 27 p/gallon  and (@ 20p/gallon)  was considered.  The results  are shown  
in Figure  4.
Leasing  5,000  and 10,000  gallons  of milk quota  increased  farm profit  by 
£ 1,771 and £3,542  respectively  in a high milk  price  situation  and by £ 1,671 and 
£3,342  for a lower  milk  price  scenarios.  This  represents  an opportunity to  increase  
farm  profit  by 35 and 33 p/gallon  of additional  quota  on the farm.  It is important  
to recognise,  that the opportunity  to produce  additional  milk is as financially  
rewarding  for a low milk price  situation  as it is for a high milk price  situation.
Effect of milk  price  on farm  profitability
The effect  of milk price on farm profitability  is shown  in Figure  5. Like  
quota  size, milk price  has a  large effect  on farm  profitability,  whether  measured  
in terms  of gross  margin or net margin,  thus explaining  the attention  that is paid  
to milk price.  An increase  of 10 p/gallon  of milk results  in an increase  in farm  
margin  of £4,113  in a quota  situation  and £5,400  in a no-quota  situation.  The 
absolute  profit  for any level of milk price is, however,  much higher  in a no­
quota  situation  because  a much  higher  level  of milk  production  is sold from the 
farm. The level of inputs should  not change  over the range of milk price  
considered  in this analysis.
Interaction  between  quota  size and milk price
In a falling  milk price situation,  farm profit is reduced  as shown in the 
previous  section.  Normally,  the dairy farmer  will try and compensate  for this 
by increasing  the scale of his farm business.  If quota  constraints  were relaxed  
then the drop in income  can be compensated  for by increasing  milk production  
on the farm. The interaction  between  quota  size and milk price on farm gross  
margin  is shown  in Figure  6. In this situation  an additional  7,800  gallons  of 
milk quota  needs  to be produced  on the farm to compensate  for a 10 p/gallon  
drop in milk price. There is great scope for increasing  milk output  on many  
farms,  as the quota  size is limiting  production  more than land and capital.  An

increase  in output  can also be obtained  with  little  change  in costs,  because  there  
is untapped  potential  in many  herds,  which  have not been exploited,  because  
of quota  constraints.
Effect  of milk  yield  per cow on farm  profitability
The importance  of milk yield per cow in determining  farm profitability  in 
a quota situation  has received  much  debate  in recent  times and has been the 
subject  of much  confusion.  Much  of the confusion  relating  to the importance  
of milk  yield  is due to the fact that it can vary with many of the inputs  associated  
with  Dairying.  Here we  consider  the importance  of milk  yield  under  an optimum  
system  of milk  production.  The effect  of milk  yield  per cow on farm  profitability  
under  a quota  and no-quota  situation  and under  a high  and low milk  price  situation  
is shown  in Figure  7. In a quota  situation,  increased  milk yield per cow results  
in increased  farm profit in a low milk price as well as in a high milk price  
situation.  The greater  advantage  is however  for the high milk price situation.  
The benefit  to increased  milk yield declines  as milk yield per cow increases.  
This follows  the principle  of economies  of scale and is mainly  found  because  
of the change  in the proportion  of other  costs and outputs  associated  with the 
cow. As milk yield per cow increases,  the number  of cows required,  to fill the 
quota,  decreases.  In a non-quota  situation,  improved  milk yield per cow has a 
far more beneficial  effect.  The effect  is linear  in this situation.  This is because

the number  of cows  on the farm  does not change.  In farm practice,  this scenario  
is a little academic,  because  additional  feed will be required  for the extra  output  
of milk. This contrasts  with a quota  situation,  where  the opportunity  cost of 
allocating  more  feed (grazed  grass)  to the dairy  cow is less.  The results  do show  
however,  that milk yield per cow is an important  measure  of productivity  on 
dairy farms.
Summary  of current  milk  production  system
Some of the more important  factors  influencing  farm profitability  were  
considered  in the above  sections.  It is evident  that Quota  size and milk price  
have a major  effect  on farm profitability.  Policy  strategies  which  control  these  
two parameters  are dictated  outside  the farm gate. It is obvious  then why they 
receive  so much  debate.  Tbe  policy  environment  does  however  have  an influence  
on the optimum  system  of milk production  at farm level.  The outcome  of an 
aggressive breeding  programme  to improve  the profitability  of the herd can be 
very different  depending  on whether  a quota  or no-quota  scenario  applies.  This 
is true also for many  other  technical  innovations  which  can be applied  at farm  
level. It is arguable  that many dairy farmers  are not aware  of this when they 
are assessing  the strategies  they are adopting  on their farms.
Performance  on commercial  dairy  farms
Farms  used for analysis
The farms used for this analysis  were selected  from the sample  of farms  
used by tbe National  Farm Survey  (NFS).  The National  Farm Survey  (NFS)  
and its predecessor, the  Farm  Management  Survey  (FMS), have  been  conducted  
annually  since 1972  on a representative  sample  of Irish farms  to monitor  trends  
in farm output,  costs, incomes  and performance.  The farms chosen  for this 
analysis  were specialist  dairy  farmers.  The objective  was to see how individual  
farms are performing  relative  to the optimum  system  of milk production  as 
described  earlier.  It is recognised  that these dairy farms  are of different  sizes,  
are located  on different  soil types  around  the country  and have various  systems  
of milk production.  The farms  were categorised  into small,  medium  and large  
farms based  on size of farm.
Measurement  of performance  on dairy  farms
The primary  financial  measures  conventionally  used in assessing  the 
performance  of dairy  herd management  are the margin  over concentrates  and 
margin  over feed and fertiliser  and the gross  margin.  The former  has indicative  
value because  concentrate  feed costs tend to represent  such a significant  
proportion  of the total variable  costs and are susceptible  to specific  control  in 
the management  of a herd.  The gross  margin  provides  the widespread  standard  
upon which herd performance  can be measured  for comparison  with herds  
producing  under  similar  systems  (herds with similar  fixed  cost structures),  since  
it represents  the sum available  to meet those fixed costs and yield a residual  
net income.  Because  many fixed resources  in Dairying  are specific  to that
81
enterprise  (and many  dairy  farms  are largely  specialised  towards  milk  production  
anyway),  it should  be possible  to specifically allocate  fixed  costs and so calculate  
a net margin  also.  This  is the equivalent  at the enterprise  level of the ‘management  
and investment  income ’ calculated  for the whole  farm;  it represents  the residual  
available  to cover  the operator ’s management  and capital  used in the enterprise.  
The National  Farm  Survey  (NFS)  data  allowed  computation  down to net  margin  
level. This is one of the reasons  why this data set was used for this analysis.
Measurement  of performance  on farms  relative  to target  values
Many  of the methods  described  above  were used on the sample  of farms  
used for this analysis.  The mean  value  for various  parameters  is often used for 
this type of analysis.  The mean is however,  often composed  of values  with a 
wide range  and the data often has a skew distribution.  The target  values  were  
derived  taking  cognisance  of the issues  discussed  earlier  and are realistic  if the 
technology  outlined  earlier  is applied  on farms.  It is argued  that the distribution  
of results  from target  values  is a better  method  for getting  an understanding  of 
what is happening  on farms.  A summary  of some  of the target  values  used are 
shown  in Table  2. The data are presented  on a per cow basis because  the cow 
is the main cost driver  on a dairy farm.

Gross  output
An analysis  of the deviation  of output  parameters  from target  values  gives  
a much  better  understanding  of farm practices.  The distribution  of farms relative  
to target  value for gross output  per cow of milk is shown  in Table 3.
A relatively  low percentage  of farms  have a gross output  per cow higher  
than the target  values.  Most of these were in the larger  farm category.  A very 
high percentage  of the farms  are however  below  the target.  The proportion  of 
farms  with very low output  per cow is particularly  evident  on smaller  farms.

Gross output  values  greater  than £ 100/cow  below target represent  a very 
significant  reduction  in output.  Much  of this is due to poor productivity  per 
animal.
Variable  costs  of production
The most significant  element  of variable  costs in milk production  is 
undoubtedly  that relating  to feed. A  significant  element  of variable  costs  come  
from concentrate  and fertiliser  use. In terms of the cost of concentrate  and 
fertiliser,  the ratios  in terms  of their costs relative  to milk price have remained  
very favourable  over  the years. They  have improved  over  the last 4-5 years  (see 
Figure  8).

There  is also great variation  in the variable  cost levels  recorded  on farms.  
The data in Table  4 show the distribution  of farms  in relation  to feed cost per 
cow and the data in Table  5 show  the distribution  of farms in relation  to total 
variable  costs per cow.

It is difficult  to reconcile  the range  in feed costs  recorded  on farms. A large 
percentage  of farms  are greater  than £50 per cow or less than £50/cow  from 
the target  values.  Feed cost of £50-£100  over target  represents  a cost of 4.5p 
to 9p per gallon  of milk produced  per cow. Low feed costs per cow is not 
necessarily  desirable.  The data would  suggest  that a large number  of herds  are 
underfed.  This is particularly  so for the smaller  sized farms.  A low level of 
feeding  is associated  with  low performance  per cow. Feed  costs  per cow should  
be within  a narrower  range.

In relation  to variable  costs per cow, a large proportion  of farms have a 
variable  cost structure  greater  than the target.  There  is considerable  scope  for 
reducing  costs  on many  of these  farms. Because  there  are variable  costs  it should 
be possible  to adjust  the costs in the short  term.  After  more  than a decade  with 
the quota  system,  variable  costs per cow should  be much  more  uniform  across
84
herds  and certainly  should  be much  closer  to the target  value.  The presence  of 
a significant  number  of farms with variable  cost structures  much below  the 
target  set would suggest  that the input  level  to these  herds is too low. It is unlikely  
that they are purchasing  the inputs  at very low prices. A focus  on very low cost 
systems  can result  in low productivity  from the herd.  A number  of farmers  are 
leasing  milk quota. This results  in an increase  in variable  costs  per cow but this 
can be compensated  for by an increase  in farm milk sales.
Gross  margin
Gross  margin  analysis  is a useful  method  for comparing  farms.  Since  gross  
margin  is the difference  between  gross output  and variable  costs, it will be 
greatly  influenced  by those factors.  The average  gross margins  recorded  on 
farms were significantly  below  the target  values  for each year. This was due 
to a combination  of a lower  gross  output  per cow and higher  variable  costs  per 
cow. The distribution  of farms  in relation  to gross  margin  per cow is shown  in 
Table 6.

Greater  than £400 less than target 40.35 41.77 19.83 38.06
A relatively  small number  of farms have a gross margin  in excess  of the 
target  chosen.  The data suggest  that there is a considerable  profit  opportunity  
lost on many  of these  farms.  The gross  margin  represents  the sum available  to 
meet fixed costs and yield a residual  net income.  Because  dairy farmers  have  
been operating  under  the quota  system  for many years now, the proportion  of 
farms  with gross  margins  much  closer  to the target  values  should  be increasing.  
This  is not the case.  The margins are also particularly  poor  for the smaller  farms.
Overhead  costs  and total costs
It is difficult  to compare  farms in relation  to overhead  costs because  the 
farms  may be at different  stages  of development.  Overhead  costs  are however,  
very important not only in relation  to the level of overhead  costs but also because  
if they are high they are difficult  to change  downwards  in the short term. The 
distribution  of farms  relative  to target  values  for overhead  costs are shown  in 
Table 7.

Greater  than £150 less than target 28.29 26.68 16.58 25.68
The overhead  costs  were also much lower  than the target  set. This is a major  
benefit  provided  it is not reducing  the potential  to increase  gross margin  per 
cow.  The target  value of £317/cow  includes  a cost of £94/cow  for depreciation,  
£75/cow  for paid (part time) labour  and £50/cow  for interest  payment  on 
borrowings.  These  together  represent  £219/cow  of the fixed  cost  used  as a target. 
It has to be recognised  that these types of payments  can vary widely  between  
farms  as discussed  earlier.  However,  the distribution  of farms  relative  to this 
target  is of interest.  Approximately  one third of farms were £0-100  less than 
the target  value  and similar  proportions  of farms  £100-£150  and greater  than 
£150  below  target. A relatively  large number  of farms  have very low overhead  
costs which  suggests  low levels  of borrowing,  old farm structures  and heavy 
dependence  on family  labour.
The distribution  of farms  relative  to target  values  for total costs per cow is 
shown  in Table 8.

The total costs  of production  are below  the target  set. This is mainly  because  
many of the farmers  have fixed costs lower  than the target set as discussed  
earlier.  A very large percentage  of farms had total cost values  of over £1(X)  
below  the target  values  set.

The data show  that a very large number  of farms  have very low net margins  
even though  milk price is relatively  good and the milk price,  concentrate  cost 
and fertiliser  cost ratio is relatively  good. This is mainly  because  of the low 
gross margin  per cow.
Quota  management  and herd  performance
The performance  level of the herd, which  is mainly  dictated  by milk yield  
per cow, is an important  determinant  of productivity  on dairy farms.  The data 
for milk yield per cow is shown  in Table 10.

The average  yield per cow is much  lower  than the target  value.  The target  
value  chosen  (1200  gallons/cow)  should  now be the norm  for the vast majority  
of farms  if the recommended  technology is applied.  Mean values  can be distorted  
by variation  in the data and the type of distribution  of this data. The data in 
Table 10 shows  that very few farms  have exceeded  the target  value  chosen.  A 
very high percentage  of farms  have yield levels  well below  the target  values. 
Low technical  productivity  as measured  by milk yield per cow is particularly  
bad for the smaller  farms.
In order  to produce  a ‘high ’ yield per cow, one important  prerequisite  is to 
have sufficient  quota  per cow available.  The distribution  of farms  in relation  
to milk quota/cow  is shown  in Table 11. This milk quota  per cow includes  
leased  quota.

Greater  than 1,200 gallons/cow 1.73 2.39 4.75 2.54
It is evident  that a very small  percentage  of farmers  have the level of quota  
per cow to achieve  the targets  set. This problem  is particularly  evident  for the 
smaller  farms.  It is very apparent  from the data that farmers  are keeping  too 
many  cows  for the quota  available.  This will inevitably result  in short  lactation ’s, 
poor nutrition  (so as to reduce  milk yield)  and other measures  to keep within  
quota. The opportunity  cost of this strategy  is also high  as a considerable  amount  
of capital  is associated  with these extra cows. Quota  management  is a major  
problem  on farms  and this is evident  from  this data.  An analysis  of the data  over 
time suggests  that farmers  are not adjusting  their dairy enterprise  so as to get 
a better  balance  between  cow numbers  and quota.
Concentrate  use
Concentrate  and fertiliser  use make up a large proportion  of the variable  
costs  on farms.  Their  efficient  use will consequently  have a large influence  on 
farm profitability.  The data in Table 12 show the level of concentrate  use on 
farms  together  with the distribution  of farms  relative  to the target  value  set for 
concentrate  use.

The actual  level of concentrate  feeding  was higher  than the target  set. The 
data show  that there is wide  distribution  in the level of concentrate  feeding  on 
farms.  Approximately  44% of farms  are within  0-200  kg of concentrate  above  
and below  the target.  There  is a high percentage  of farms  feeding  a high level 
of concentrate  feed. This is especially  so for the larger  herds.  This results  in 
increased  feed costs  and consequently  in increased  variable  costs  per cow.  There  
is a significant  number  of herds with very low levels  of concentrate  feeding.  
This is equally  undesirable  if it is not replaced  with excellent  quality  forage.  
The consequence  can be lower  than expected  herd performance.
Summary
The analysis  carried  out on this section  shows  no evidence  that dairy  farmers  
are influenced  to any large extent  by the economic  principles  governing  
production.  Dairy  farmers  are now operating  under  the quota  system  for over 
a decade  and should  have made  the necessary  adjustments  by the time period  
over which  this analysis  was carried  out. It is argued  that quota  management  
is a major  problem  on farms.  Farmers  are keeping  too many  cows  for the quota  
available.  The application  of the quota  system  in Ireland  is partly  responsible  
for this. Over  a number  of years,  many  dairy  farmers  were able to produce  milk 
in excess  of their quota without  paying  any appreciable  super levies. It is 
understandable  why dairy farmers  would  get involved  in this strategy  because  
of the effect which  quota size has on overall  farm profitability.  The wide  
distribution of farms  relating  to the  many  issues  described  in this section  shows  
that there is considerable  room for improvement.  There is no evidence  from 
this type of analysis  over time that dairy farmers  are focused  on these issues. 
The low fixed cost structure  on farms is an advantage.  This is due to a large  
extent  on the use of family  labour  and low depreciation  charges.  The analysis
89
of the farms  in this section  relative  to the model  system  described  earlier  shows  
that there is considerable  income  foregone  on many dairy farms.

Milk Quotas  Likely  to be Abolished  
Shortly  After  2000

Abstract
The size of the tariffs  protecting  the EU market  are falling  each year under  
the Uruguay Round  Agreement  (URA).  However, the  calculations  are contrived  
in such a way that the reductions  are not yet affecting  farm-gate  prices.  The 
next trade agreement  to follow  the URA  in 2001/02  will presumably  continue  
the reductions  in tariffs.  At that time the levels  will already  be so low that any 
further  reductions  are likely  to cause  farm-gate  prices  and some  commodities,  
including  milk, to fall. In these  circumstances,  quotas  on milk production  will 
quickly  become  redundant.
The EU is committed  to retaining  quotas  to the year 2000.  Anticipating  the 
next trade  round,  the EU will have  cogent  reasons  to abolish  quotas  soon after  
2000. Such a prospect  would  not be as threatening  to the Irish economy  as 
many believe,  as it would  be accompanied  by substantial  compensation.  
However,  that compensation  would hardly  be as generous  as under the 
MacSharry  reforms,  because  the EU’s trading  partners  would  probably  insist  
on it being  decoupled  from  commodity  production,  and the EU itself  would  be 
likely to curtail  its scale and duration.  In the longer  term the important  
consideration  would  be the competitiveness  of the Irish dairy industry  in a free  
trade world.
1. Introduction
The experience  with milk quotas  in the EU since 1984 is first reviewed  in 
Section  2 of this paper.  The EU is committed  to continuing  with a quota  policy  
up to 2000, so the next  opportunity  to assess  the quota  approach will arise  around  
that time. Since  this will coincide  with negotiations  for a new trade round  to 
follow  the URA,  these  trade rounds  provide  the policy  framework  for analysis  
of future  milk policy  options  as reported  in Section  3.
2. Quotas  versus  prices  to-date
The EC Commission ’s proposal  in July 1983 to introduce  a quota  system  
to control  milk production  initially  caused  shock  and confusion  in Ireland.  The 
opening  negotiating  position  adopted  was to reject  the very concept  of quotas  
for the obvious  reasons  that:
(i) they  would  freeze  the expansion  of the profitable  and dynamic  milk sector  
in Ireland,  which  had been growing  at 5% per annum  over the previous  
decade;  and
(ii) they  would  create  a new barrier  to entry and expansion  at individual  farm 
level.
91
However,  the existence  of a serious  crisis in the EC dairy  sector  was generally 
accepted,  so that some  action  was necessary  to tackle  it. The ideal action  from  
Ireland ’s point  of view would  have been penalties  on other  Member  States  with 
exemption  for Ireland. While  this was widely  advocated  in Ireland,  it never  had 
any hope of being  accepted  in Brussels.  It quickly  became  clear that the only 
realistic  alternative  to the quota  approach  was to cut prices.  The Commission  
suggested  that a 12% price reduction  would  be needed  (COM(83)500  final, 
par.4.8),  but this would  only be for openers.  Given static  demand, any subsequent  
expansion  after  the initial  price  cut - and despite  it - would  lead to further  price  
reductions  in the following  years.
Once farmers  realised  that the choice  was between  quotas  and price  
reductions,  a consensus  quickly  developed  in favour  of the lesser  of the two 
evils. And this continues  to be the basic rationale  for quotas  today.  If quotas  
were now suddenly  abandoned  there would  undoubtedly  be a big upsurge  in 
milk  production,  which  again  could  only be curtailed  by cutting  the price.  Nobody 
knows  how large a  price  fall would  be necessary.  But it is well known  that both 
the demand  for and the supply  of milk are not very responsive  to declining  
prices.  This means  that a relatively  large price reduction  would  be necessary  
to stimulate  demand  and curtail supply  by enough  to clear  markets  in the absence  
of quotas.  If one assumes  that output  would  increase  by 15% at present  prices  
on the removal  of quotas,  and if one further  assumes  optimistically  that price  
elasticities  of demand  and supply  at farm gate are -0.5 and +0.5, respectively,  
then the price fall necessary  to restore  market  balance  would  be 15%.
Another  way of viewing  this price cut is to consider  by how much milk 
prices  would  have had to fall in the EU since 1984 if the quota  approach  had 
been rejected  in favour  of the price approach.  Real milk prices  have actually  
fallen  by 20% between  1983 and 1995,  even with the operation  of quotas  and 
a cumulative  reduction  of 9% in the aggregate  EU quota. In the absence  of 
quotas,  the 20% price fall would  have had to be augmented  by the 15% cut 
suggested  above  plus a further  9% reduction  to achieve  the equivalent  of the 
9% quota  cut. Therefore,  real milk prices  would  have had to fall by an extra  
23% (l-(0.85  X 0.91))  on top of the 20%  actually  recorded.  In other  words  Irish 
farmers  would  be receiving  around  75 pence  per gallon  now. If the true elasticities  
are less than those assumed  above,  then prices would  have had to fall even 
more, and Irish milk prices now - in the absence  of quotas  - would be 
proportionately  less than 75 pence  per gallon.
In the debates  on the relative  merits  of quotas  versus  reduced  prices,  some  
people  argued  that Irish dairy farmers  could  fare better  under  a price approach  
by increasing  productivity  to offset  the effects  of price reduction.
To enable  a farmer  to break  even  as between  the price and quota  approaches  
with the optimistic  elasticities  assumed  above,  production  would  have had to 
grow faster  than the 5% annual  growth  of the pre-quota  decade,  and it would 
have to do this in an environment  of sharply  falling  prices.  If the elasticities  
were less than those  assumed  above, the annual  growth rate to break  even would 
have had to be much greater.  These  simple  calculations  illustrate  the great  
difficulty  for farmers  to offset the adversity  of falling  prices by increasing
92
productivity.  And they highlight  the advantages  of a quota  approach  for farmers  
despite  its restrictive  and bureaucratic  aspects which  curtail structural  adjustment  
and damage  the efficiency  of the industry  (Brennan,  1994).
3. Milk  policy  options  after  2000
The URA,  which  came into operation  on July 1 1995, spans  the six years  
1995/96  to 2000/01.  There  are three  commercial  dimensions  to the agreement,  
namely,  reducing  domestic  support,  increasing  market  access  and reducing  export  
subsidies.  In each of these areas all participating  countries  are committed  to 
achieve  quantified  targets which  will begin  to open up heavily  protected  markets  
to international  competition.  However,  the targets  are contrived  in such a way 
that the degree  of trade liberalisation  will be minimal  in the course  of this round.
The limited  impact  of the URA and the apparent  remoteness  of the next 
trade  agreement  in 2001/02  have  generated  a degree  of complacency  regarding  
the future  course  of agricultural  policy.  While  the URA will not have major  
short-term  effects,  its real significance  is that it has put in place a foundation  
which  will be built upon in the next trade round.  In other  words,  it is the first 
step towards  free trade.
The EU has deeided  to continue  with quotas  up to the year 2000.  Along  the 
way the aggregate  quota  will probably  have to be cut, but the rate of reduction  
will be modest,  averaging  about  0.6%  per annum.  In contrast,  the price  of milk  
within  the quota  does not have to be reduced  because  of the URA,  though  of 
course  the Council  of Ministers  may decide  to reduce  it for other reasons.
To identify  and analyse  the feasible  milk policy  options  after 2000, it is 
necessary  to define  the shape of the next trade round.  This is attempted  by 
projecting  forward  into the next round  the URA  reductions  in protection,  at the 
same rate as is occurring  under the URA. It is argued  that other exporting  
countries  are unlikely  to settle  for less in the next round,  especially  since  their  
bargaining  position  will be stronger.  Such projections  would  lead to rapidly  
falling  prices  caused  by continuing  reduction  in domestic  support  and, more  
particularly,  by further  tariff reduction.
The second  programme  relates  to the future  of direct  payments.  It is argued  
(Sheehy  1996)  that the EU’s trading  partners  will insist  in the next trade round  
on further  decoupling  of these  payments  from current  production  to minimise  
the impact  on trade. Further  decoupled  payments  would  be based  on historic  
production  and would  have no link to current  production.  The McSharry  
payments  are decoupled  from additional  production  beyond  base period  
quantities  but are fully linked  to production  within  these  quantities.  This  degree  
of decoupling  was reluctantly  accepted  by the US and other trading  partners  
towards  the end of the Uruguay  round  negotiations.  At that time the US, as well 
as the EU, made  such payments  a significant  part of its policy.  Now  the US has 
further  decoupled  its payments  in its 1996  Farm  Bill. They  are now linked  only 
to land on which  farmers  are free to produce  whatever  they please.  In other  
words  they are transformed  into Area  Aid. It therefore  appears  that the EU will 
be pressurised  in the next trade round to modify  its direct  payments  accordingly.
It is clear  that the ultimate  result  of these  trends  will be free trade. Therefore,
93
any policy  option  in the next trade  round  will merely  be a transitional  one over 
a period  of time until free trade is reached.
Given  this framework  the main feasible  options  for milk policy  appear  to 
be:
1. Continuing  with quotas  but with falling  prices  for quota  milk - called  the 
Quota/Price  Approach;  and
2. Abandoning  quotas  - called  here  the Price  Approach.  While  continuing  with 
the present  policy  of quotas  with high prices  is not considered  feasible,  it 
is worth exploring  how it might be done and why it is unlikely  to be 
acceptable.  It is called  the Quota  Approach.
Within  these  three  approaches  there  is a great  number  of possible  variations.  
In particular,  the role of Quota  B milk  (unsubsidised  milk  for export),  the prospect  
of compensation,  and the necessity  to absorb  new members  into the EU are  key 
issues.  The Quota  B proposition  is first considered,  before  turning  to analyse  
each of the three approaches  in turn.
3.1. Quota  B milk
Quota  B production  has been advocated  as a possibility  even during  the 
present  trade  round  (Danish  Dairy  Board,  1994).  This  would  enable  milk  beyond  
a basic Quota  A to be produced  for export  without  subsidies.  It is argued  that 
it would  enable  the EU to retain  world  market  share  in competition  with other  
exporters,  who  are free  to expand  and increase  their  market  shares  - New  Zealand  
and the US in particular.  The merit  of retaining  a market  share  during  the URA, 
which  would  probably  be lost  as trade  liberalisation  progresses  in the next  round, 
is far from clear.
It is also claimed  that Quota  B milk would  enable  efficient  farmers  and 
processors  to increase  their  incomes/profits  from  the extra  production  involved.  
But advocates  of Quota  B production  also emphasise  that its extent  would  have 
to be very restrictive  and carefully  monitored  to minimise  adverse  effects  on 
dairy  markets.  Large  supplies  of Quota  B milk onto world  markets  would  push  
down world prices,  thereby  reducing  revenue  for Quota  A milk from those  
markets.  In addition,  as tariffs  continue  to be reduced  into the  next trade  round, 
the internal  EU market  will become  sensitive  to the level  of international  prices,  
and lower  world  prices  then would  also mean lower internal  prices.  A small  
Quota  B volume  could  have only a small impact  on income  - amounting  to no 
more than a trivial 1 % for farmers  according  to one estimate  (Teagasc,  1995,  
p.34).
Furthermore,  monitoring  production  over time would  be very difficult,  as 
production  could not be switched  on and off to match  the vagaries  of international 
markets.  Indeed,  it is not at all clear how Quota  B production  could even be 
segregated  from Quota  A.
Finally, there  is the matter  of getting  World  Trade  Organisation  approval  for 
such an approach.  While  there is no explicit  bar to Quota  B milk in the URA, 
other  world  traders  would  almost  certainly  challenge  an initiative  which  would 
allow the EU to increase  competition  on world markets.
The case for Quota  B production  is therefore  not very convincing.  It is not
94
likely  to be adopted  during  the present  trade  agreement;  nor does it have  much  
of a role in the next trade  agreement  in any of the policy  approaches  considered  
below.  Only in the Quota  Approach  - the least likely approach  to be agreed  - 
and in an environment  of high world  prices  would  it have much merit.
3.2. The Quota  Approach
Probably  most EU farmers  would  opt for the Quota  Approach,  by which  
they would  wish to continue  the present  quota  policy  through  the next trade  
round,  and thereby  continue  to maintain  high prices  for production  within  the 
quota.  This could  only happen  if the reduction  in domestic  support  and in the 
level of tariffs,  which  is proceeding  under  the URA,  were to be abandoned  in 
the next round.  But the prospect  is for a much more aggressive  attack  on 
agricultural  protection  in the next round  rather  than any abatement  of pressure.  
All other agricultural  exporters,  including  the Central  European  Countries  
(CECs),  will push for full free trade in agriculture  as quickly  as possible.  The 
freezing of domestic  support  and tariffs  in that framework  seems  most  unlikely.  
Slowing  down  the rate of reduction,  as distinct  from freezing  it, is possible  but 
not considered  probable  in the circumstances.
Even if the retention  of high  prices  were somehow  agreed  by EU’s trading  
partners,  it would  pose  enormous  problems  for the accession  of the CECs.  They  
would  have to impose  a quota  system  in their countries  and they would  have  
to raise prices  towards  EU levels,  neither  of which  they would  want to do. In 
fact if they were forced  to do so, no sooner  would  they have them in place  than 
they would  have  to dismantle  them  again,  as the world  continued  to move  towards  
free trade.
3.3. The quota/price  approach
Already  in the URA  tariffs  on milk products  are falling  at the equivalent  of 
about  5 pence  per gallon  per annum  (Keane,  M. et al, 1995).  However,  this is 
having  no impact  on trade, because  the initial tariffs  were set so high in the 
Uruguay  Round  negotiations  that even after cutting  them they are still high 
enough  to prevent  access  to EU markets.  This situation  will change  when tariffs  
have fallen  to levels  that will influence  trade.  If world  prices  remain  at current  
levels,  that will have  happened  at about  the end of the present  trade agreement.  
However,  if world  prices  rise by that time, it will be postponed  for a period.  
If, as is most likely,  world  prices  continue  to fluctuate,  declining  tariffs will 
provide  effective  protection  in times of high world prices but will allow EU 
prices  to fall in periods  of low prices.
Projecting  forward  the tariff reduction  occurring  under the URA, while  
retaining  the quota  system,  would  thus mean an average  annual  price fall at 
farm gate, either  early on in the next round  or during  it, of about  5 pence  per 
gallon.  In addition,  EU prices  would  become  exposed  to fluctuations  in world  
prices,  as the tariffs  under  the URA are fixed sums unlike  the variable  tariffs  
which  they  have  replaced.  There  is however  a safeguard  provision  which  would  
allow additional  duties  to be imposed  if either  the volume  of imports  or the 
price of imports  exceed  defined  limits.  This would protect  against  extreme  
fluctuations  only.
95
The volume  of quota  production  could  possibly  be maintained  in this scenario, 
even  as subsidised  exports  were  reduced  and minimum  market  access increased,  
because  EU consumption  would  be boosted  by the price reduction.
The issue of EU compensation  for price and quota reduction  will be an 
important  concern  in the next round,  as it is in the present  round.  There  are 
reasonable  prospects  of adequate  funding  within  the CAP  budget  ceiling  to pay 
full compensation  (Matthews,  1996),  but as argued  above  that compensation  
is likely  to have  to be decoupled  from  commodity  production  by using  area aid 
linked  to land only.
Decoupling  from commodity  production  would  be a radical  initiative  in 
agricultural  policy.  It would  have serious  implications  for the volume  of 
production,  as farmers  would  no longer  be required  to produce  to qualify  for 
payments.  The extent  to which  farmers  would  then cut back their crop and 
livestock  output,  given  that such cut-backs  would  not affect  their  entitlements,  
would  be a concern  for upstream  and downstream  industries  whose  activities  
would  decline  accordingly.
In addition  to these direct  effects  of further  decoupling,  there would  also 
be important  indirect  effects.  Once decoupled  from production,  the rationale  
for such payments  could  only be either  (i) as income  supplements,  or (ii) as 
payments  for the production  of “public  goods ” (goods  which  society  is willing  
to pay for but which  markets  fail to produce,  such as, clean environment  and 
rural viability).  In both cases  the payment  of large  sums  to large farmers  would  
be difficult  to justify,  and  capping  payments  per farmer  would be likely to  ensue. 
In so far as the payments  would  be compensatory,  it would  be argued  that they 
should  be phased  out over time as farm resources  were redeployed  to other  
activities.  Furthermore,  the case for central  EU funding  would  be weakened  
and the threat  of renationalisation  enhanced.  The potential adverse  consequences  
for the Irish economy  of each of these changes  are obvious.
With  respect  to enlargement,  the Quota/Price  Approach  would  not pose such 
great problems  for the CECs as the Quota  Approach.  If support  and tariff  
reductions  force  down  prices as fast as projected  here,  the declining  prices  would 
rapidly  approach  the level of free trade prices,  which should  be rising as 
international  markets  are freed  up. CEC  quotas  might  not then  be necessary  for 
the short transitional  period  to free trade.
3.4. The Price  Approach
The Price  Approach  would  involve  abolishing  quotas,  either  immediately  
after 2000 or at the beginning  of the next trade round in 2001/02.  Associated  
with this, the price of milk would  be forced  down by an upsurge  in milk 
production,  as farmers  rushed  to expand  and utilise  their  pent-up  capacity.  The 
extent  of the price  reduction  is impossible  to estimate,  but a reduction  of 15% 
was suggested  in Section  2 to maintain  market  balance. This may sound severe,  
but in a situation  where  milk prices  would  be falling  rapidly,  it would  merely 
be bringing  forward  reductions  which  would  take place anyway  a few years 
later.
With this approach,  EU price levels  would  be determined  by the level of
96
world  prices  plus the declining  tariff.  The tariff  would  finally  disappear,  at the 
rates of reduction  projected,  some 12 years after 2001/02  when full free trade  
would prevail,  subject  only to safeguard  provisions.  Of course,  faster  or slower  
tariff  reduction  would  bring forward  or delay that event.
Abolition  of quotas  would  not be as disadvantageous  to farmers  as many  
now fear. Budgetary  capacity  should  be sufficient  to allow more sizeable  
compensation,  though  again it would  probably  be further  decoupled,  capped  
and digressive  as described  above.  While the price reduction  would not be 
welcomed  by farmers,  the restoration  of freedom  to individual  farmers  to enter  
and expand  dairying  as they pleased  would  be attractive, even  though  this would  
then be occurring  at lower  price levels.
As far as EU enlargement  is concerned,  the Price Approach  is by far the 
most  compatible.  Prices  in the EU would  fall rapidly  towards  free trade  levels,  
and new Member  States  would  not have to raise their  prices  to any significant  
degree;  nor would  they have to adopt quotas.  They would  be free to farm  
according  to profit  signals  from international  markets.
Anticipating  the requirements  of the next trade round  and of enlargement,  
the EU will have cogent  reasons  for abandoning  quotas  either  ahead  of, or at 
the beginning  of, the next trade  agreement  in 2001/02.  Indeed,  the Commission  
has already  stated  so in its Agricultural  Strategy  Paper  as follows:
Among  the different  possible  options,  the Commission  clearly  favours  
developing  the approach  that was started  successfully  with  the 1992  reform.  
This implies  a reduced  reliance  on price support,  compensated  where  
necessary  by direct payments,  whatever  their concrete  form may be. 
Furthermore,  it implies  a better  integration  between  market  policies,  rural 
development  and environmental  policies.  Such an approach  would  have  the 
great advantage  of facilitating  the CECs accession  for both sides (EU 
Commission,  1995, p.36)
The implications  for Ireland  of abolishing  quotas  would  depend  on the 
compensation  payable  and on the competitiveness  of the Irish dairy industry  
in a free trade world.

Essential  Requirements  for a Competitive  
and Profitable  Industry  - A New  Zealand  
View
J. C. ROADLEY  
Alpine  Dairy  Co., New Zealand.
When  contemplating  this topic two fundamental  questions  kept coming  to 
my mind;
Which  dairy industry?
Profitable  for whom?
It is my intention  to focus on what  I believe  to be the essential  requirements  
for a competitive  and profitable  dairy in a generic  sense  - not just what makes  
a profitable  industry  in New Zealand,  nor what it may take in Ireland.  But what  
I believe  dairy  farmers,  from  whichever  hemisphere  should  appreciate  if we are 
to have a prosperous  and secure  future.
In the past  there  has been an unhealthy  preoccupation  amongst  policy makers  
and dairy industry  leaders,  with making  the dairy industry  profitable  in their 
region  at the expense  of the dairy industry  in other places.
In New Zealand  we have felt this acutely  because  what has been done to 
support  the competitiveness  of the dairy industries  in Europe,  in the United  
States  and in Japan  has been at our cost.
For too long we have been denied  the opportunity  to compete  in many  
markets,  which  have been reserved  exclusively  for the domestic  suppliers  and 
in open  markets  where  we have  been able  to market  our products  we have  faced  
debilitating  and unfair  competition  from subsidised  exports  from the over 
production  in those protected  places.
Regardless  of whether  you agree  or not about  that being  the mould  in which  
the international  dairy  sector  has operated,  it is surely  not going  to be the pattern  
for the future.
In New  Zealand  we believe  that the ways  things  have been done in the past  
have  not been in  the best interest  of dairy farming  families  and in many instances  
have lead to a dead end.
In Japan,  the most highly  paid and protected  industry  in the world,  dairy  
farmer  numbers  are reducing  at an enormous  rate - 115000  farmers  in 1980  
down to 55000  in 1992 and still dropping  fast.
You as Irish Dairy Farmers  will understand  what I mean because  of the 
restrictions  you face with the milk quota  system  and other  artificial  distortions  
that the European  Union ’s market  support  system  has brought  you. Despite  
being low cost efficient  producers  in Europe  you are restricted  to Just 5% of 
the total.
The new  era dawning is one in which  there  will be a progressive  liberalisation 
of markets;  where  the distortions  on imports  and the subsidies  on exports  will 
be rolled  back.
98
In the future,  as dairy  farmers,  we are going  to need to pay very much  more  
attention  to what  is going  to make our industry  truly  competitive  and profitable
• In a real commercial  sense
• On a long term sustainable  basis
• and  - on a basis  that is not dependent  on government  intervention  and support,  
and as a result,  vulnerable  to the whims  of political  decisions.
So what  are the essential  requirements  for a soundly based  commercial  dairy  
industry?
1. Customers
Customers  are where  it all begins.
Customers  who want our products  now and in the future.
Customers  with real money.
Without  customers  there is no business.  A producer,  whether  he is a 
manufacture,  a farmer  or the provider  of a service,  has no future without  
customers  for his products.
Fortunately  there  is a large  natural customer  base  for milk  and dairy  products.  
Milk  is a wonderful  product,  one of nature ’s most  basic  foods  and an eminently  
flexible  raw material  for a whole  range  of processed  food products  and other  
goods.
However,  we cannot  assume  that customers  will come  queuing  at our door  
nor should  we take customers  for granted  or be complacent  about  their needs.  
There is a dramatic  shift in the retailing  of dairy products,  supermarkets  
everywhere  are gaining  market  share. In most European  countries  the top 3 
supermarkets  have 30% share and in some places  dominate  with 70%. This 
represents  a unique  challenge  to dairy  manufacturers  and marketeers  requiring  
increases  in scale and cost savings.
We must be constantly  seeking  to ensure  that we are satisfying  those  
customers  we already  have and working  to broaden  our customer  base. There  
are significant  opportunities  in the growing  markets  in many parts  of the world,  
notably  in the dynamic  economies  of South  East  Asia  and Latin  America  as the 
populations  of these regions  and countries  grow, and more importantly  their  
incomes  and standards  of living improve.
These  growing  markets  need careful  nurturing  and developing  especially  
those where  milk  or milk  products  are not their  food  of first choice.  This  accounts  
for almost  all of North  and South  East Asia.The Uruguay  Round  agreements  were a step in this direction,  but the first
step only. Others  will surely  follow.
2. Products
Satisfying  customers  is all about  delivering  them products  which they  want,  
when they want them and in a form that they require.
In a highly  competitive  world  there are substitutes  for everything.  We must  
realise  and accept  that milk  and dairy  products  are no exception.  Our competitor  
industries,  in beverages  and foods,  are constantly  placing  before  the customers
99
new choices  with innovative  products  and new presentations  of long  established  
items.  These  efforts  are to maintain  the support  of their  customers  and to attract  
customers  who have  been consumers  of dairy  products.  This has to  be matched,  
and requires  large investment.
To maintain  and develop  the business,  investment  is required  in;
• product  development
• process  technology
• raw milk production,  including:  quantity,  quality  and composition.
3. Competitive  prices
There are many ways to compete  and be competitive.  Our approach  to 
marketing  must be as sophisticated  as our competitors
• in product  innovation
• in promotion
• in advertising
But we can never overlook  the most basic element  of competition  in the 
markets  which  is pricing.  Creating  cost leadership  through  economies  of scale,  
cost  control  and high  productivity  and achieving  competitive  advantage  without  
reducing  product  or service  quality  must be the goal.
Prices  have to be competitive  with substitute  products.  While  this doesn ’t 
necessarily  mean having  the lowest  prices in the market,  it does mean  
recognising,  for example,  that if butter  is double  the price of margarine  then 
despite  all butter ’s quality  attributes  the simple  fact is - less butter  would  be 
consumed  and shoppers  will move to using more margarine.
4. Low  costs
If competitive  prices  are to be translated  into profits,  costs must  be pushed  
to the minimum.  In just the same  way that we must  constantly  strive  to satisfy  
our customers,  there must be equal effort and commitment  to reduce  costs. 
Failure  to control  and reduce  costs at any step of the production  chain will 
quickly  extinguish  any gains made in the market  place.
This is evident  in New Zealand  right now as we, the farmers,  encouraged  
by the prospects  of improving  prices and a desire to improve  our herds  
productivity,  have increased  the costs of producing  milk to the point where  
overall  farm profitability  has been compromised.
While  the on farm costs  are extremely  important  in the profitability  equation  
and have a particular  emphasis  at this conference,  this is only the first step and 
we need to push hard for cost savings  in all the links of the chain:
• in processing
• in administration
• in transport  and storage
• in marketing  and distribution
5. Technology  and Innovation
The major  key to success  in all these areas is the successful  development  
and application  of new technologies  and techniques.
100
Creative  marketing  demands  a constant  flow of new ideas, new products  
and new marketing  techniques.
Innovation  is critical,  innovation  at all steps of the value  chain,  new ways  
of doing  things  on our farms,  increasing  productivity  with  better  cows  and bener  
operating  practices,  lowering  costs  by finding  more  efficient  ways  of managing  
our resources,  improving  quality  with better  technology  and animal  health.
Innovation in milk  transport  and processing. Finding  better  ways  transporting  
milk at the lowest  possible  cost yet protecting  its quality  and composition.  
Processing  in plants  that give economies  of scale,  employing  technology  that 
improve  yield and enhance  the attributes  customers  require.
Innovation  in distribution  and marketing,  making  as short as possible  the 
order  to delivery  cycle.  Finding  smarter  packaging  and more  efficient  handling  
and storage  systems.
Innovation  is the key to sustained  competitive  advantage.  New ideas,  new 
techniques,  new products  being  constantly  available  are essential  ingredients  
for success  in the market.
Technology  does not just mean having  scientists  at laboratory  benches  or 
on research  farms.  All the most  elaborate  research  in the world  is useless  unless  
it is relevant  and is then adopted  and applied.  Technology  transfer,  getting  the 
new methods into practice, is the vital ingredient  in any research  and development  
strategy  and much easier  achieved  if the technology  plan is focused  and 
integrated.
I turn now to the second  question;  profits  for whom?
After the efforts  put in to be competitive  and profitable  we need to take 
some time to think about the question  - profits  for whom?
I find there  are many  definitions  of “profit ”. For the sake of this discussion  
I will describe  profit  as pecuniary  gain - excess  of returns  over outlay.
Business  is made  up of many stakeholder  groups all working  together,  wiAin  
that grouping  there will always  be the cardinal  stakeholder.  It is the cardinal  
stakeholder  who  drives  the business  and takes  the profits,  all other  stakeholders ’ 
needs  are taken  care of within  the operation  and counted  as a cost to doing  the 
business.
So as dairy farmers  where  do we fit in the equation?
There  is nothing  particularly  special about  producing milk.  It is an endeavour  
as old as time and thanks  to the tolerance  of the dairy cow it is not all that 
difficult.  Milk is produced  in all environments  in the world.  From the heat of 
the tropics  to the coldest  regions.  In one environment  the cows are kept cool 
while  in the other  they are kept warm,  in both instances  the feed is brought  to 
the cow and she obliges  and makes  milk! Milk is a highly  perishable  product,  
produced  daily and loses its value very quickly  unless processed  into a 
commercial,  storable  form.
It would  be easy to assume  that a milk producer  had little future  beyond  
being a commodity  producer.  These  facts have encouraged  dairy farmers  all 
around  the world  to be actively  involved  in the marketing  of their  produce  outside  
the farm gate, in a way that is not seen in many other primary  agricultural  
industries.
101
The importance  of the cooperative  system,  farmer  ownership  and control,  
of milk  processing  and marketing  to the dairy industry  is demonstrated  around  
the world.
In New Zealand  our cooperatively  controlled,  integrated,  cow to customer  
business  model  is very dear  to us as dairy farmers.  It ensures  we are the cardinal  
stakeholders  and the ‘profits ’ of the investments  and the effort,  flow to us in 
the best possible  milk price.  We do this by capturing  the advantages  that only 
the cooperative  structure  can offer.  Because  the owners  of the business  all belong  
to the same interest  group  - Dairy Farmers  - we are able to look beyond  the 
needs of only our individual  Company  Shareholders  and cooperate  in the 
development  of technology  and marketing  endeavour;  then compete  as 
independent  companies  to ensure  the most  efficient  and innovative  use is made  
of the cooperative  effort,  thus enhancing  the results  for all. This model has 
proved  successful  for us. I believe  that we are yet to reap all the potential  of 
it and am very optimistic  about  what can be achieved  for the benefits  of dairy  
farming  families  in the future.
There  is an air of anticipation  in New Zealand  now as our dairy industry  
out-performs  our sister  pastoral  sector  industries  of meat and wool.  Although  
this is very much  a relativity  issue as in real terms  our milk returns  are not as 
good  as they have been in the recent  past, there is an increase  in production  of 
around  4%. The national  herd is growing  and existing  farm productivity  is 
improving  stimulated  by the constant  adoption  of the latest  technologies.  In our 
region  there  is a large  shift in land use to dairy  farming.  We are being  required  
to increase  the capacity  and scale  of our cooperative  to manage  the increasing  
numbers  of farmers  wishing  to join. We have modernised  the structure  of our 
co-op.  to cater  for the large  amounts  of capital  being  required,  a “growth  funds  
growth ” policy  is seeing  capital  that would  have been paid to retiring  meat  and 
wool farmers  when  their land is sold for dairy conversion,  now being  paid to 
the co-op.  to provide  equity  to develop  the business.  This concept  is providing  
clear  ownership  of the processing  and marketing  infrastructure  beyond the farm 
gate and generates  a higher  level of interest  in all aspects  of our industry.  This 
is the New Zealand  solution  for securing  the future  for the dairy industry.

Potential  Milk  Production  from  Grass  and 
Limiting  Factors
F. F GORDON
Agricultural  Research  Institute  of Northern  Ireland,  Hillsborough,  Co. Down.
Introduction
It is important  within  any industry  to provide  a long term look towards  the 
future, particularly  in relation  to setting targets  for the industry  and establishing  
principles  in relation  to the best way of striving  to meet these targets.  This 
paper,  which  is mainly  set within  a theoretical  context,  will attempt  to set the 
scene in relation  to what  production  might  be possible  from  grassland  and then 
consider  how far these  targets  might  be achieved  in the future.  It will also aim 
to highlight  the factors  which  are likely  to limit  progress  towards  meeting  these  
targets. The paper  will not attempt  to address  specific  and detailed  management  
issues,  as numerous  other  papers  will more  appropriately  address  these.  It must  
also be remembered  that while  this paper  is specifically  addressing  the issue  
of production  potential  from grassland,  any system  which  is employed  at farm  
level must be examined  within  an economic  framework  as well as production  
potential.  The impact  of the continuing  influence  of milk quotas  must also be 
addressed.
Milk production  from grassland  is driven  through  three main channels;
(a) The quantity  of grass produced.
(b) The grazing  efficiency  of the animal  and
(c) The conversion  efficiency  of grass to milk within  the animal.
While  these  are shown  above as stand  alone  effects, and in a rather  simplistic  
manner,  there are many  interactions  and these  cannot  be ignored.  For example  
the quantity  of grass  grown can be influenced  by the grazing  efficiency  (stocking  
rate). In addition  there are also major  conflicts  across  areas.  For example  the 
objective  of improving  the conversion  efficiency  of grass into milk within  the 
animal  implies  the need for high milk yields  per cow, yet this conflicts  with 
grazing  efficiency.
Potential  grass  production
At the outset  it is necessary  to establish  a potential  target  for grass growth,  
but before  we consider  this we should  be clear about the varying  processes  
which  are taking  place  within  the grass  sward  at any point in time. The nature  
of these processes  and the relative  importance  of each, is shown  in Table 1, 
derived  from  Parsons  (1988).  While  Parsons  (1988)  presented  his data in terms  
of tonnes  of organic  matter,  for uniformity  in this paper  these  have  been converted  
into dry matter  terms.

13.0 t DM/ha  (5.3 t DM/acre)
This demonstrates  that although  the sward  initially  produces  the equivalent  
of 65 t DM/ha  because  of the loss processes  in the system  the yield eventually  
harvested  is only some  20% of this. A key component  of this loss is death  and 
decay  within  the sward,  and this is an area which  must be minimised.  There  
is obviously  considerable  scope  for improvement.  Wright  (1978)  suggested  a 
potential  yield  of 30 t/ha was  possible  and the same  author  has recorded  a yield  
of 24 t/ha from  experimental  plots  in Northern  Ireland.  Cooper  and Breese  (1971) 
have recorded  a top yield of 29 t DM/ha  (11.3 t DM/acre).  This level has not 
been achieved  at the field level,  nor is it likely  to be, because  gone  are the days  
when we can afford,  either  financially  or environmentally,  to use the levels  of 
plant nutrients  which  would  be necessary  to move towards  such targets.
However  within  a more practical  context  high levels  of grass dry matter  
production  have been produced  within  Ireland.  In a 5-year  field scale cutting  
experiment  at Hillsborough,  using an Italian  ryegrass  sward  receiving  around  
600 kg N/ha,  a mean yield of 18 t DM/ha  (7.3 t/acre)  was produced.  Brereton  
(1995)  also quoted  grass  yields  from Moorepark  in 1988 of 18.4 t DM/ha  (7.4 
t/acre)  with 600 kg N), and in work at Grange  a mean yield of 15 t/ha (6.1 t/ 
acre) was recorded  with a 4-cut  silage  system.  The potential  for grass growth  
is clearly  high, and if grass breeders  can continue  to progress  at a rate 0.5% 
increase  in yield per year then by the year 2000 there is a clear potential  in 
grassland  for yields  approaching  20 t DM/ha  (8.1 t/acre).
While  these figures  are given  to indicate  a ‘field potential ’ it is recognised  
that there  are major  differences  between  sites and years  in grass DM  production.  
Brereton  (1995)  has developed  a model  for grass growth,  in which  the rate of 
growth  is proportional  to the solar  radiation  received  at the surface  of the crop 
and the efficiency  of use of this radiation  is related  to the air temperature.  The 
impact  of moisture  deficit  is also taken into account.  Figure  1 (Brereton  1995)  
shows  how this model predicts  grass output  for the different  regions  within  
Ireland,  showing  yields varying  from over 15 t DM/ha  (6.1 t/acre)  in the 
Southwest  to 11 t/ha (4.5 t/acre)  in the Northeast  of Ireland.
There  are also major  differences  between  years,  with data from Moorepark  
over a 10 year period  showing  a mean yield of 13.4 t/ha (5.4 t/acre)  with a 
maximum  of 18.4 and minimum  of 10.9 t/ha. Brereton  (1995)  clearly  suggests  
that these  regional  and annual  variations,  must  be embraced  in any management  
system  which  is developed.

Converting  grass  into milk
In the previous  section a range  of targets  was established  for grass  production  
within a cutting  environment.  It is recognised  that the introduction  of the animal  
is likely,  although  not necessarily,  to result in a reduction  in the yield of dry 
matter.  The extent  of any reduction  will be related  to issues  such as the intervals  
which can  be adopted  between  defoliation ’s, how quickly  the animal  defoliates  
the pasture  and the severity  of defoliation.  Severe  defoliation,  due to very high 
stocking  rates, are likely to considerably  depress  grass growth.
Notwithstanding  the above comments  and taking  as a starting  point the 
quantity  of herbage  which  we should  be able to grow,  and the feed  requirements  
for animals,  we can provide  theoretical  targets for potential  outputs  per hectare.  
For example  the calculation  in Table 2 is based  on a grass DM yield of 18 t/ 
ha (7.3 t/acre)  and a dairy cow giving  5(X)0 kg milk over a 305 day lactation.
This simplistic  calculation  in Table 2 makes  a number  of important  
assumptions,  with the key ones being;  (a) that grass yield of 18 t DM/ha  can 
be achieved;  and (b) the dairy cow giving  5(K)0 kg milk can be sustained  on 
a diet solely  of grass and grass silage,  with no meal feeding.  Neither  of these  
in themselves  are unreasonable  targets  but no one has yet put them  together  into

a system.  Certainly  the production  per cow targets  are very modest  when  
compared  with the potential  performance  which  can be achieved  from our 
animals  under  controlled  feeding  conditions.
Why have  these  targets  not been  achieved?  Firstly  from the cow standpoint  
no one has really  explored  the true potential  of grass  alone  in our environment.  
Work in 1984  and 1985 at Hillsborough,  with late spring  calving  cows,  resulted  
in a mean lactation  performance  of 4,600  kg/cow.  Similarly  later work with 
autumn  calving  cows  resulted  in a mean  yield  of around  4200  kg/cow.  However  
in neither  of these  systems  did we really set  out to totally  exploit  the full potential 
of grass and silage.  For example,  no concessions  were made  to the production  
of an improved  quality  silage.  Meeting  the grass growth,  and hence  stocking  
rate target  may be much  more  difficult  - i.e. a stocking  rate of 1 cow/0.62  acres. 
However  if the grass  yield is set at 141 DM/ha  (5.7 t/acre)  then  a target  stocking  
rate of 3.1 cows/ha  (0.8 acres/cow)  becomes  much  more achievable.
Table  3 shows  how these  simplistic  calculations  would  alter as we increase  
cow yield in the system  - but still making  the same assumptions  with regards  
to the potential  to produce  all the requirements  for the differing  animals  within 
the grassland/forage  system.

106
This set of theoretical  data (based  on 14 t DM/ha)  demonstrates  that if we 
could meet the animals  feed requirements  from within  a totally  grass/forage  
environment  then increasing  milk yield can have a major  effect  on output  of 
milk  per hectare  or per acre. However  the data above  have  been  purposely  taken  
as very wide extremes  in yield (1070-1920  gal/cow,  an increase  of 80%) yet 
you should  note that the improvement  in output  per acre is much  more  modest,  
at 27% (This concept  must not be missed  in any thinking  about  the impact  of 
yield  per cow).  The key element  here in this calculation  is that we assume  that 
grass supply/intake  is controlled  according  to animal  needs,  i.e. that we have  
stocked  our lower yielding  cows at a sufficiently  high level to ensure  full 
efficiency  of grass use. When  we do this, more  minor  and realistic  changes  in 
yield (eg from 5000 to 6000 kg- 1280 gals) would  result  in approximately  a 
9% increase  in milk output  per acre.
Bringing  realism  into the targets
While  the previous  theoretical  calculations  have  provided  a background  target 
it is obvious  that there is a need to inject  realism  into some  of the figures.  For 
example the  calculations  suggest  that the nutritional  needs of both the 5000  and 
the 9000  kg cow can be equally  met from  grass/and  silage  diets.  Obviously  this 
is not true, and Table  4 provides  some guidelines  in terms  of what might  be 
possible  to achieve  in a practical  context.

Achievability  of target Easy Possible Impossible?
Basing  the calculations  on average  intake  of DM required  per day the intake  
of grass DM  required  during  grazing  for the 5000  kg and 70(X)  kg cows  are well 
within  accepted  figures  for intake  at pasture.  McGilloway  (1996)  in a review  
of herbage  intake  concluded  that intakes  of up to 17.0 kg could be achieved  
with medium  merit cows grazed  under  good conditions.  Some  recent  French  
work (quoted  by Mayne  and Peyraud  1996)  suggested  that 19-20  kg DM/day  
may be possible  with  high producing  dairy cows  grazing  swards  in early  season.  
The target  therefore  set for the 50(X)  kg cow at pasture  should  be easy to achieve.  
The target  for the 7000  kg cow is also achievable  in terms  of intake  at pasture.
In relation  to the indoor  feeding  period  Cushnahan  et al. (1995)  at 
Hillsborough  have shown  that the primary  reason  for low intakes  of ensiled
107
grass is the late stage  of growth  at which  grass is harvested,  and that the more  
minor  effect  is that of the ensiling  process.  In this work they have recorded  
mean  DM intakes  with high digestibility  silage  of 14.6 kg/day,  a level which  
will support  both the 5000  and 7000  kg cow if silage  ME is 12 MJ/kg  DM. In 
the major  intake  study  of silages  from farms  in Northern  Ireland  (Steen  et ai, 
1995)  the best intake  recorded  in that study  was equivalent  to 15.6 kg DM/day. 
In the present  winter  at Hillsborough  we are feeding  a silage  which  has a mean 
intake  of 14 kg DM day when  given  with a concentrate  level of 3 kg/day.  This 
would  equate  to a DMI of at least 15 kg/day  if fed alone.  These  data indicate  
that with  good  silages  intakes  of 16 kg/day  are potentially  achievable,  provided  
we are prepared  to leave  behind  our existing  mind set in terms  of conservation  
practices  - mainly  through  harvesting  material  at a much leafier  stage  of growth.  
All these  data indicate  that we have the potential  to easily  meet the needs of 
the 5(X)0  kg cow on a year  round basis, and indeed  the potential  to strive towards  
a mean yield of 7000 kg from a grass and forage  only system.  However  I see 
no prospect  of achieving  the targets  necessary  for the 9000 kg cow.
In assessing  the above  targets,  the fluctuating  needs  of the dairy cow over 
lactation  have  not been considered,  and these  are obviously  important.  However  
it is more important  to ensure  that we can meet the total energy  requirements  
of the cow over the year before  we concern  ourselves  about the issues the 
individual  stages  of lactation.  The cow has a  remarkable  capacity  to buffer  itself  
across  lactation  (indeed  this is the basis of flat rate feeding  or feeding  a single  
complete  diet across  the lactation)  and in my mind if we are to exploit  the full 
potential  of grass,  which  we recognise  has a limited  intake  potential  and will 
never meet the needs of the high yielding  cow in early lactation,  then our 
objective  must be to achieve  a constant  high intake  every day over the total 
year. This is much  more  important  than worrying  about  peak  lactation  and then 
setting  out to starve  cows at other periods  of lactation.
Being  realistic  about  the above  figures  I see the possibility  of achieving  an 
animal  production target  of 6000  kg milk/cow  as realisable  from grass  and silage  
alone with minimum  inputs  of other  feeds. Such additional  feeds should  only 
be to provide  for any imbalance  of nutrients  by the animal  (e.g. minerals  or 
rumen  undegradable  protein).
The constraints  to achieving  these  targets
While  it is easy to set potential  targets  there are many constraints  which 
may apply  at farm level.  These  constraints  may be of a technical  nature,  or an 
economic  nature,  or even an environmental  nature  and it is impossible  to cover  
these  in this short  paper.  However  some  attempt  will be made to highlight  some 
of these from my viewpoint.
(a) In such systems  is increased  yield (genetic  merit)  a worthwhile  goal?
The calculations  presented  earlier  have  shown  benefits  in terms  of efficiency  
of converting  food energy  into milk  as we increase  milk  yield.  These  theoretical  
benefits  have been widely  demonstrated  in indoor  feeding  systems  (Langhill 
and Hillsborough) and in the grazing  environment  (Bryant  et al., 1986  and Dillon
108
personal  communication).  There  is no doubt  that if you can feed two animals  
the same  quality  of feed and achieve  greater  efficiency  in feed use by one than 
the other  then the more  efficient  animal  is the one to use. This is what  the above  
feeding studies  have  clearly  demonstrated.  However  as soon  as you move  away  
from  this scenario,  of being  able to  provide  equal  quality  feeds  to both animals,  
then we must be very careful  in making  assumptions  that the same approach  
will provide  the same benefits  to those outlined  earlier.  In other words  if the 
higher  yielding  cow requires  an improved  quality  of diet (assuming  increasing  
quality results  in increased  cost)  to be sustained  on a year  round  basis,  then this 
may result  in any blind drive  for improved  efficiency  resulting  in a reduction  
in overall  herd profitability.  This is particularly  true if we have to replace  a 
cheap feed, such as grazed  grass, with a very much more expensive  feed.  
(Ironically  my argument  does  not hold so much  weight  when  we are  in a winter  
feeding  situation  in which  silage  and concentrates  are much  closer  in terms  of 
relative  costs  and hence  replacement  of one by the other  has not such dramatic  
effects).  Indeed  it could  be argued  that if we are in a cheap  feed situation  (such  
as grazed  grass)  then there are only minor  financial  benefits  to be gained  by 
striving  to marginally  improve  the efficiency  of conversion  of feed into milk,  
and certainly  this should  not be to the extent  that we need  to improve  the quality  
of feed through  the use of high cost supplements.  It is possible  that in this 
scenario  we should not  breed  animals  for improved  feed efficiency  (which  means  
lower  DM intake  per unit of milk  produced)  - rather  we should  breed  to maximise  
intake  as this will allow  greater  quantities  of bulk feeds  to be used to meet the 
animals ’ needs.
(b) Is pursuing  maximum  intake  at pasture  a worthwhile  goal?
As the milk yield of the cow increases  then we become  increasingly  
concerned  about  trying  to maximise  their  intake,  and hence  performance  of the 
individual  cow at pasture.  This is a very understandable  position  but we must  
be careful with  the conclusion  to which  this leads  us. The major  factor  controlling  
intake  at pasture  is the amount  of herbage  allocated  per cow (Meijs  and Hoekstra  
1984).  Figure  2 provides  a representation  of how the intake  of the dairy cow 
increases  as the quantity  of herbage  offered  per cow is increased.  Some  
calculations  derived  from the data used to produce  this figure  are presented  in 
Table 5.
Table 5
Effect  of increasing  the quantity  of grass offered  to cows on their intake  and the 
efficiency  of utilisation  of this additional  grass (from  Meijs  and Hoekstra  1984)

20 13.4 48%
25 15.2 35%
30 16.2 21%
35 16.6 7%
109
When  the quantity  of grass offered  per cow is low then the efficiency  of 
grazing  will be high (efficient  utilisation  of available  herbage),  the quality  of 
the regrowth  will be high  and the sward  will not deteriorate  over  years. However  
as we offer  the cow more  grass,  in an effort  to improve  performance,  then very 
quickly  the additional  grass consumed  by the cow is only a fraction  of the 
additional  grass  offered.  This becomes  a totally  inefficient  system.  It not only 
results  in inefficient  grass  use at the point  of grazing  but also to later problems  
in terms  of the quality  of the pasture  regrowth.  This  can also cause  deterioration  
in the sward  from  year  on year. It is recognised  that some  of this difficulty  may 
be overcome  by pasture  topping  mid season  (Stakelum  1991).  Nevertheless  I 
would  question  the logic of going too far down the road of using higher  
allocations  of herbage  as a route  to improving  animal  intake  and performance.  
If it is going  to take 5-6 kg additional  grass  allocated  to result  in 1 kg additional  
intake  then might  we not be better  either  accepting  the consequences  of the 
lower  intake  or using the cheapest  possible  supplements  to achieve  the same  
end result  in terms of intake.
(c) Supplementation  at pasture
A few years  ago we were  all clearly  of the view  that when  pasture availability  
was adequate  then supplementation  at pasture  was an ill founded  practice.  
However  as milk yields  have increased,  many have become  more reconciled  
to feeding  supplements  at pasture.  We must all clearly  ask on what basis we 
do this:- (a) is it necessary  to sustain  our system,  such as getting  cows in calf 
or for long term animal  survival?  or (b) is it an attempt  to provide  an enhanced  
economic  return  through  the response  to supplementation.  The data available  
at present  would  certainly  suggest  that there  is considerable  interaction  between  
the benefit  we get in total intake  and performance  from supplementation  at 
pasture  and the amount  of herbage  on offer (Meijs  and Hoekstra  1984).  For
Fig 2 - Effect  of herbage  allowance  on herbage  intake  at different  
levels  of concentrate  feeding  (Meijs  and Hoekstra,  1984)
no
example,  Figure  2 from Meijs  and Hoekstra  (1984)  presented  earlier  shows  that 
if we are laxly  grazing  (which  is what  is often  suggested  for high  yielding  cows)  
then there are major  depressions  in grass  intake  when  we give concentrates.  In 
fact the only time when it is ever logical  to give concentrates  is when the 
allocation  of grass is low and the sward is being tightly  grazed.  This is 
demonstrated  in Table 6.
When 30 kg of grass OM/day  is offered  then the addition  of 1 kg of 
concentrates  results  in the cow eating  0.69 kg less grass.  Hardly  a reasonable  
outcome  and not one from which  you can expect  an economic  response.
Table  6
Effect  of supplementation  with concentrates  on DM intake  when using  
different  herbage  allowances  (Mayne  1991)
Herbage  allowance Substitution  rate
(kg OM/day) (kg herbage  OM/kg  cone OM)
15 0.11
20 0.30
25 0.50
30 0.69
It is therefore  clear that supplementation,  almost  irrespective  of yield, is 
unlikely to have  a reasonable  effect  on total nutrient  intake  unless  when  pasture  
is being tightly  grazed. This  effect,  when  considered  with that presented  earlier  
in terms  of the wastefulness  of high herbage  allowances,  would  tend to suggest  
that if high performance  animals  are to be grazed  at pasture  then a strategy  of 
maintaining  a sufficiently  tight stocking  rate, coupled  with controlled  
supplementation,  is likely  to be the most  effective.  This would  ensure  efficient  
utilisation  of pasture  and retain sward quality.  The alternative  of using low 
stocking rates and lower  levels  of supplementation  seems  a very difficult  route.
(d) Remember  the replacement  heifer
When we begin to compare  differing  systems  of dairying,  in terms of 
efficiency of converting  feed into milk  (or indeed  total land  resource  into milk),  
we must  not only  consider  the dairy  herd  itself  but also its supporting  replacement  
rearing  unit. The efficiency  of converting  grass  into milk within  the rearing  unit 
is zero,  and hence  differing  policies  of herd  replacement,  enforced  or by choice,  
can have  an effect  on total efficiency  of feed use, or potential  milk output/acre.  
For example  Table  7 considers  two replacement  policies  for a herd of cows.
Table  7
Effect  of replacement  rearing  policy  on efficiency  of feed energy  use in the 
total dairying  system
Yield (kg/cow)  5000  7000
Annual  replacements  reared  (%) 15 40 15 40
Efficiency  of systems  (%) 29 24 35 29
111
This shows  that while  we can struggle  to become  a few percent  more  efficient  
in our dairy  cow keeping  we can easily  lose  this if we have  a higher  replacement  
rate. For example,  a 5000 kg yield per cow coupled  with 15% replacements,  
is as efficient,  in feed use terms,  as achieving  7000  kg milk  per cow and rearing  
40% replacements.  These  calculations  demonstrate  that we cannot  consider  the 
dairy herd in isolation  as the type of system  we plan can influence  many  other  
issues  which  in themselves  will have major  impacts  on efficiency  of feed use.
Moving  towards  the future
The previous  sections  have set a potential  production  from an all grass/  
silage  based  system  and by implication have  suggested  that if this is the direction  
our industry  should  go then there are further  opportunities  for us to make  
progress.  However,  as soon as we leave our present  simplistic  approaches  to 
managing  the dairying  systems  which  have  served this  industry  well in the past, 
then we immediately  think  about  how to fine-tuning  the system.  This I would  
contend  is where  all the management  difficulties  arise, and each of these  
difficulties  is magnified  many fold as the genetic  merit (or potential  feed use 
efficiency)  of the herd improves.  This  increasingly  puts pressure  on management  
and the total decision  making  processes  on the farm.  There  are many  strategies  
which  we can adopt  as milk yield/cow  increases,  but we must  take  each  of these  
steps carefully.  We have previously  discussed  aspects  such as;- allocating  the 
correct  amount  of grass; under  what situations  will an economic  response  to 
meal at grass  be obtained;  and which  type of supplement  etc. to feed. All these  
are in reality  high pressure  decisions  in which  it is important  to arrive  at the 
correct  answer.  I would  contend  that while  research in the past has been  effective  
in helping  the industry  to move  along  a broad  front  to its present  position  it has 
not really  addressed  the issue  of how we are to move  forward  over the next 10- 
15 years.  We are now  leaving  behind  the era of ‘blueprints ’ for systems  (although  
they must remain  in the back of our mind as guidelines  from which  we start) 
and must now move  towards  approaches  which  will provide  the manager  with 
sound  and reliable  decision  support  systems.  Systems  which  are solid,  robust  
and are driven  from an economic  base. They must assess  economic  outcomes  
and not be driven  by dogma.  No longer  can we provide  simple  answer  to 
questions,  such as the average  response  to concentrates  at grass  is 0.4 kg milk/  
kg concentrate  and therefore  we should  not feed these.  If the farmer  is to get 
it right all the time (which  must be the objective)  then he must have the 
management  tools upon  which  to make  decisions. It is certainly  not good  enough 
for researchers  to say that it is either  too complex,  or we will provide  the farmer  
with an understanding  of what is going  on and he can then make the proper  
decision  on his farm. I will demonstrate  what I mean by quoting  to you the 
performance  results  from the last 11 dairy cow experiments  at Hillsborough  
which  have examined  the response  to wilting  of grass  prior to ensiling  (Table  
8). These  results  can either  be quoted  as an average  response  to wilting  of 6% 
in animal  performance,  and therefore  it is not worth striving  to achieve  this. 
Alternatively  you can consider  the individual  experiments  and see that in some  
experiments  there was a depression  in yield from wilting  yet in some we had

each  using  rapid  wilting  techniques  and none  had rain during  the wilting  process.  
If I make  the assumption  that high  quality wilting systems  (spreading  and tedding  
grass)  are expensive  then surely  the correct  answer  is that we must be able to 
help the manager  to decide  when  he will get a major  benefit  from wilting  and 
when he will not get any. Only when we have decision  support  mechanisms  
that will help make  this type of decision  will researchers  have truly delivered.
Conclusions
Target  production  potentials  from grassland  based  systems  have been set 
and there is scope  for becoming  more  efficient  in systems  which  are based  on 
relatively low  inputs  of supplementary  feed.  A target  of 7000  kg milk/cow  (1500  
gal) from grass and silage alone and at a stocking  rate of 1 cow/acre  is a 
possibility,  if this is the objective  we wish to have in our systems.  However  in 
systems  where  grazed  grass is a major  component  then we must be extremely  
careful  in terms  of how we move  along  the route  of aiming  for higher  animal  
performance,  and more complex  systems.  If this is to be achievable  then 
researchers  must provide  the industry  with good ‘decision  support  systems ’ 
which  will help the farmer  through  the much  more complex  decision  making  
processes which  will be involved.  Otherwise  we are likely  to move  our industry  
in entirely  the wrong  direction  based on complex  systems  which cannot  be 
implemented  at farm level.

Securing  the Future  for the Dairy  
Industry
DENIS  BROSNAN  
Kerry  Group  pic, Tralee,  Co. Kerry.
In addressing  this topic, we all know the importance  attached  to efficient  
production,  milk quotas,  world  production  of milk and, of course,  the global  
marketplace.  However,  these topics will all be adequately  addressed  at the 
conference  by people  more  expert  than I so in discussions  with your Secretary  
a few months  ago, I choose  the much narrower  topic “Diversify  of Merge ”. I 
may be accused  of ignoring  the third alternative  “stay as we are”.
However,  just like the producer  having  to change,  so also must  the industry  
to secure  its future  and that of its suppliers.
For centuries  past, industries  have had to restructure  to meet competitive  
forces.  It is no different  today, other  than the world  is moving  at a far faster  pace  
and we have far shorter  time frames  in which  to react.  I need not mention  BSE  
or CJD where action  at industry  or government  level would  not alone  have  been  
enough  without  action  on a broader  EU basis.  Even so, the industry  will never  
be the same.
During  past years  and into the next  century,  the dairy  industry  in Europe  and 
throughout  the world  is coming  face to face with new major  external  pressures  
which  were not there even one decade  ago.
CAP Reform
GATT  Agreement,  Eastern  Europe  and other  emerging  milk  producing  regions
Multiple  buying  power
Rapidly  changing  consumer  taste and demand
Global  food companies
There are many other forces  which  were not there in the ’70s or ’80s - 
environmental  requirements,  the corporate  image,  government  or EU regulations,  
the working  week and employee  expectations  and, of course,  the right of the 
individual.
Different  companies  will react in different  ways to these many  challenges.  
Those  who read the situation  best will be the winners  down  the road - winners  
for their suppliers,  winners  for their shareholders,  winners  for all associated  
with the entity.
We can have a macro  and a micro  reading  of the total situation,  obviously  
very much influenced  by the timeframe  involved.  On a macro level,  raw materials  
for dairy or other  food products  will be produced  in the lower  cost producing  
areas,  manufactured  where it is most  competitive,  and  consumer  taste  and buying  
power  will dictate  what is produced  as distinct  from a production  led decision.  
If the consumer  thinks  butterfat  is too expensive  or less healthy,  then the consumer  
will not buy it.
These  are the long-term  scenarios  that co-ops  or companies  have  to address.
115
There  are many  steps along  the way which  effect  the lives and livelihoods  of 
a great number  of people.
The reform  of the CAP  and the freeing  up of world  trade  in the new GATT 
agreement  will, in time,  change  the price  and, perhaps,  the source  for dairy  and 
other  food raw materials.  Europe ’s prices  may be too expensive. At the present  
time, farmers  within  the EU receive,  for the most part, higher  prices  for their  
farming  produce  than those  being  obtained  on the world  markets.  Under  CAP  
reform,  these prices  will reduce  by reducing  the support  mechanism  and by 
reducing  the export  subsidies.  Farmers  will be compensated  through  direct  
income  support.
Few of us could  envisage  that it would  have taken so little time for certain  
farmers  to start looking  for B milk quota.  The call comes  particularly  from 
farmers  who are very efficient  and who feel they can produce  milk profitably  
at world  market  prices.  Though  the topic needs and will get a great deal of 
debate,  as a processor  of milk, I have to ask myself  the question  - Will milk 
be cheaper  in Europe  in the next decade  by having  no quotas  or B quotas  or 
should  I look to other  places  in the world  for cheaper  sources  of milk now?  The 
debate  so far has been  producer  led. The implications  at processing  and marketing 
level are just as significant.  B quota  is of little use to small  producers.  If such  
a quota  comes  will the processor  and marketer  of milk move  elsewhere.  Life 
was certainly  much easier  in the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s.
The GATT  agreement  gives greater  access  to EU markets  for certain  
agricultural  produce  which  will come  on to the EU market  at lower  prices.  Side 
by side with GATT,  we have NAFTA  - a trade agreement  for North  America  
and the certainty  of an enlarged  EU. Eastern  Europe  is a producer  of dairy and 
other  food commodities  produced  at far lower  prices,  and though  access  to EU 
is now limited,  the need for political  stability  will bring greater  access  as the 
years progress.
Most  consumer  foods in Europe  are now sold through  the shelves  of very 
large retailers  where  fewer  than six companies  control  50% of the food retail  
space in each of the countries  in northern  Europe.  Side by side with this 
development,  retailers  own brands  are moving  towards  50% of all products  
sold on those retail shelves.  In past decades,  retailers  own label brands  were 
often lower  priced  and of lesser  quality  but, today,  all that is changed  where,  
own label is as good if not better  than any of the traditional  brands  to which  
we have become  accustomed.
Perhaps,  for the dairy  industry  and for most  industries,  this would be  enough  
change  to cope with but now we have the rapid emergence  of the large or 
multinational  food companies.  The merger  of dairy co-operatives  within  
countries  in Europe  has obviously  been phase 1. Phase  2, when it comes,  will 
certainly  break  down country  borders.  Global  food companies  from America  
and Europe  are following  a strategy  of producing  their branded  foods right  
throughout  the world.  We have  Pepsi, Nestle,  Grand  Met, McDonalds  and many 
others  who are pushing  out all the frontiers  to become  global  players  while 
trying  to be cost competitive  in everything  they do. This is leading  to, not just 
global  marketing  but global  R & D and buying.
116
None  of us can, any longer, under-estimate  the importance  of the consumer.  
The rapidly changing  consumer  taste and demand  is bringing  its challenges  and 
its opportunities.  Eating  out, microwave  cooking,  ready  meals  and global  tastes  
have all been pushing  the outer  limits  of technology.  How in the ’70s could  I 
have ever forecast  that my own organisation  would  source,  process  and sell 
more water  from the Dingle  Peninsula  than we would  milk and that it would  
be selling  at a higher  price in the market-place?
I felt it important  to sketch  and review  this background,  the threats  and 
challenges  to this industry,  before  discussing  the narrower  topic “Diversify  or 
Merge. ”
Ireland  is a natural  milk producing  region  so we will always  have dairy  
farmers.  However, none  of us can predict  in ten years  from  now as  to how many  
or what will be the price of a gallon  of milk. We can be certain  that one will 
influence the other.  Kerry  Co-op  had over 7,000  milk suppliers  in 1974 where,  
today,  3,360  milk suppliers  produce  a greater  amount  of milk in those same  
regions.  The introduction  of a B quota  would  increase  milk  production  in Europe,  
and would  restore  some of our world  markets,  now being  picked  up by other  
producing  areas.  The introduction  of a B quota  would  also reduce  the number  
of milk producers  who could not compete.
Kerry,  as everyone  knows,  chose  the route to diversify.  Back in the early  
’80s, it gave us the best chance  of protecting  the incomes  and keeping  on farms  
the greatest  number  of milk suppliers.  Diversification  brought  other  sources  of 
income  where  farmers  as shareholders  also benefited.  Dividends  and share  values 
as well as milk price  all form an important  component  in our farmers  income.  
The Kerry  type  of organisation  succeeds  because  it has many  different  businesses  
depending  on different  raw materials  and different  consumers  in various  countries  
throughout  the world.  When  one area turns down,  there always  is something  
else to compensate.
In Ireland,  Dairygold  went  a different  route  and throughout  Europe,  for the 
most  part, the  dairy  industry  has opted  more  for merger  than for diversification.  
Perhaps,  if I were  Chief  Executive  of a large  dairy,  with large  dairy  farmers  and 
with similar  co-operative  neighbours,  I would  push strongly  for merger  to meet  
the global  threat.  The merger  of co-operatives  and milk processors  will bring  
economies  of scale.  However,  we need something  more  for the decades  ahead.  
I see not just the merger  of dairy co-operatives,  needed  for size and efficiency  
but the merger  of dairy  co-operatives  with their  marketing  arm whether  that be 
in Ireland,  New Zealand  or elsewhere.  The alternative  is for the merged entities  
to have their own strong  sales and marketing  arm. The world  marketplace  is 
calling  for size and world  marketeers.  The forces  around  us, consumers,  world  
buyers,  world competition,  will slowly,  but with certainty,  bring about the 
evolution.  Merging  co-operatives  within  countries  or across  geographic  
boundaries  will bring the economies  of scale but never  the ultimate  solution.  
The ultimate  solution  is to be a global  marketeer.  Time,  and not the process  I 
describe,  is the only thing that is uncertain.
In Ireland,  not so long ago, the competition  was Golden  Vale, Ballyclough,  
Mitchelstown,  Kerry  and others.  Then  as these organisations  got closer  together,
117
the competition  became  the dairy industries  of other countries,  Denmark,  
Holland,  France  and New Zealand.  We are now at a new frontier  where  
competition  in the dairy industry  is coming  from the new emerging  dairy  
countries.  However,  outside  of our dairy industry,  there has been new sources  
of competition  - vegetable  fat replacing  butter  fat, cereal proteins  replacing  
dairy  proteins,  other  carbohydrates  replacing  whey  solids.  We concern ourselves  
so much  about  one another  in the dairy industry  that we can all stay blind to 
the threats  and opportunities  these changes  offer. Securing  the future  for the 
dairy industry  and its suppliers  will best succeed  when we open our eyes and 
minds  to what is changing  so rapidly  around  us.
Farmers  and their  co-operatives,  be it in Ireland  or elsewhere  must  first ask 
if they are contented  to be suppliers  of commodities  to those who process  or 
supply  the supermarket  shelf. If this is the goal, then those who produce  and 
sell at the lowest  price gain the upper  hand. However,  I would  suggest  there  
is little security  for the EU dairy farmer  in this type of scenario.  Milk can be 
produced  at a much  lower  price in other  parts of the world.  If a farmer  or co­
operative  wishes  to go a stage further  - they themselves  supplying  the 
supermarket  shelf,  there  must  be a  consciousness  of the world  market  changing  
to global  companies,  global  sellers  and global  tastes.  Only global  players  will 
be noticed  in a few decades  from now.
Let me summarise.  The pace of change  has never been faster. Large  
corporations  are living  in a smaller  world  where  travelling  to any part of it can 
be done at very short notice.  These  large corporations  in our dairy and food 
world  will determine  our and our farmers  future.  It is important  that we become  
one or more of those corporations.  Whether  we should  diversify  or merge  to 
become  a global  supplier  is not the issue.  The issue is to ensure  that the dairy 
industry  is not left behind  and that it follows  one or other  or both routes.  That  
will best secure  the future  for those  who supply  milk  or work  in the dairy  industry.

Efficient  Use of Grass  for Mid-Season  
Lamb  Production

In mid-season  lamb production  the objective  is to produce  suitable  lambs  
for sale mainly  in the June to October  period.  Grassland  management  attempts  
to match  grass  supply  with feed demand  so as to achieve  high  lamb  growth  rate 
on grazed  pasture  with a minimum  reliance  on concentrate  supplementation.
Lambing  date
This should  be chosen  such that in a normal  spring  there is enough  grass  
to meet ewes requirements  at turn-out  without  the need for concentrate  
supplementation.  The date is typically  about  mid-March  at stocking  rates  of 10 
to 12 ewes/ha.  Some  adjustment  would  be required  at lower  or higher  stocking  
rates. Old pastures,  low in ryegrasses,  will be some 10 days later in spring  
growth  than reseeded  pastures  and this should  also be kept in mind.  There  are 
also regional  and year to year variations  in the date of spring  grass growth.  
Lambing  in February  [2 to 4 weeks  before  enough  early grass is available]  
increases  the concentrate  requirements  for ewes  post lambing  and may only be 
justified  in the expectation  of selling  lambs  before  the normal  seasonal  price  
drop.
Feed  budgeting
Effective  feed  budgeting  requires  some  knowledge  of flock  feed requirements  
at different  times  of the year,  an estimate  of available  herbage,  and of the expected  
grass growth  rate.
Feed  demand:  The feed requirements  of ewes is high post lambing  in order  
to meet requirements  for body maintenance  and milk production.  Measured  
herbage  intake  by ewes at pasture  at Belclare  increased  from about 2 kg of 
organic  matter  in week  3 to about  3 kg in weeks  6 to 7 of lactation  and declined  
gradually  to about 2 kg in week 14. Intake  by ewes rearing  twins was 11% 
higher  than for those rearing  singles  (Vulich  et al, 1991).  An intake  of about  
1 kg is sufficient  for body maintenance  post-weaning  and this would  increase  
to about 1.5 kg at flushing  to allow for same weight  gain. Intake  by lambs  
increased  to about  1 kg at weaning  and remained  in the range 1.0 to 1.2 kg post-  
weaning  in the July/Sept  period  on grass  swards.  The herbage  requirements  for 
ewes and lambs  can therefore  be estimated.  For example,  at 12 ewes/ha  the 
herbage  requirement  in week  3 of lactation  [early  April  for mid-March  lambing]  
would  be about  27 kg DM/day,  and this increases  to about  48 kg in week 13 
for ewes and lambs [at 1.5 lambs/ewe].
119
Feed  supply:  This can be estimated  from sward  height  and the relationship  
between  sward  height  and yield of DM. This relationship  can vary somewhat  
from sward  to sward  and at different  times  during  the season  but can still give 
a useful  estimate  of the yield of DM available  for grazing.  On cattle  pastures  
at Grange,  for sward  heights  in the range  6 to 12 cm each 1 cm above  a cutting  
height  of 3.5 cm gave  a yield  of about  200 kg DM/ha  (O’Riordan,  E. G. 1995).  
On sheep  pastures  at Belclare  in spring  1 cm height  is equivalent  to about 180 
kg DM. When  grazing  down  to 3 to 5 cm each 1 cm residue  is equivalent  to 
about 140 kg DM. A pre-grazing  height  of 7 cm gives a yield of about 1260  
kg of DM, while  a post grazing  height  of 4 cm gives  a residue  of 560 kg DM, 
giving  a utilisation  figure  of 700 kg DM. At 12 ewes/ha  in a 4 paddock  grazing  
system  the grazing  pressure  on a paddock  is 48 ewes with a feed requirement  
in week  3 of lactation  of 108 kg DM.  Therefore  the paddock  will provide  grazing  
for 6 to 7 days.
Sward  height
This is a simple  yet useful  guide  to the quantity  of herbage  available  and 
its suitability  for sheep  grazing.  The rising  plate pasture  meter  or sward  stick  
gives a reliable  measurement  when pasture  is in the vegetative  or leafy state.  
Caution  is needed  with height  measurements  taken  in June when  pastures  may 
be getting  stemmy  if undergrazed  at this time. Stemmy  pasture  will give high 
readings  for sward  height  but this is a poor indicator  of the suitability  of the 
pasture  for sheep.
Grazing  system
High lamb growth  rates can be achieved  under  set stocking  or rotational  
grazing,  provided  the pasture  is grazed  at the desired  height.  However  it is 
more  difficult  to maintain  suitable  sward  heights  with set stocking  particularly  
when grass growth  is changing  rapidly.  Paddock  grazing  gives greater  
management  flexibility  and makes  it easier  to take corrective  action when 
required.  Extra  nitrogen  can be applied  to one or more  paddocks  if grass is too 
short,  or a paddock  can be closed  for cutting  if grass  is too high. The latter  can 
be very important  in late May/early  June in preventing  the pasture  becoming  
stemmy  with consequent  detrimental  effects  on lamb growth  rate. With the 
widespread  adoption  of baled silage,  surplus  grass can now be more easily  
conserved  at any time. A rotational  grazing  system  can operate  successfully  
with 6 to 9 paddocks
Grass  at turn-out
The first critical  requirement  in the grazing  season  is to have enough  grass  
at turn-out  for ewes. A sward height  of 4 to 6 cm will meet the immediate  
requirements  of the flock  without  the need for supplementary  feeding.  This can 
usually  be achieved  in mid to late March  where  early grass is planned  for by 
closing  pastures  by the end of November  and applying  50 kg of N in February.
April-May:  The objective  at this time is to ensure  that there is sufficient  
grass  for grazing  and that the sward  is maintained  in a leafy  state and prevented

from becoming  stemmy  in late May/June.  Results  in Table 1 indicate  that for 
set stocking  a ward height  of about  6 cm (range 5 to 7) is the optimum  for April/  
May. Tight  grazing  at 4 cm will reduce  lamb growth  rate but lax grazing  at up 
to 9 cm will give little further  improvement  in lamb growth  rate. Lax grazing  
in late May results  in selective  grazing  by sheep  and the pasture  becoming  quite  
stemmy  in June. This is more obvious  on old permanent  pastures  where  
unpalatable  grasses  such as red fescue  are rejected,  resulting  in the pasture  
developing  a patch-work  appearance  of tightly-grazed  areas  and rejected  high-  
grass areas. Lax grazing  may provide  a buffer  against  grass shortage  due to 
drought,  but does so at the expense  of grass quality  later in the season.

With  rotational  grazing,  the question  arises as  to how  tightly paddocks  should  
be grazed  by sheep.  Results  in Table 2 with a ewe lamb flock illustrate  the 
effect  of post-grazing  sward  height  on lamb  weights.  It is clear  that grazing  too 
tightly,  to 3 cm, for 14 weeks  depressed  lamb weaning  weight.  However  a post  
grazing  height  of 6 cm which  gave the highest  weaning  weight  may not be 
appropriate  for April,  May and June.  Tight  grazing  in April had little effect  on 
the 5 week  weight  of lambs.  The effect  is more pronounced  when  tight grazing  
was continued  in May and June.  This may be due to the fact that in April  grass  
is very  leafy and high quality  so ewes  can graze  tightly  without  restricting  lamb  
performance.  Later  in May/June  the base of the sward  becomes  more stemmy  
as the flowering  stems  rise. Tight  grazing  at this time forces  lambs  in particular  
to eat herbage  of lower  digestibility,  thereby  reducing  their performance.  As a 
general  guide,  post-grazing  heights  of 3,4,5  and 6 cm may be  more  appropriate  
for March,  April,  May  and June  respectively. For the same  reasons sward heights  
of 5 and 6 cm may be near optimum  in April and May respectively  for set 
stocking.
June:  This is a difficult  time to maintain pastures  in a leafy  state  and prevent  
a decline  in lamb  growth  rate. Records  show  that the growth  rate of March-born
121
lambs  from 10 to 14 weeks  is often  lower  than in the period  of up to 10 weeks  
of age. This reduced  growth  rate occurs  in late May and June when  ewe milk 
supply is decreasing  and lambs  are becoming  increasingly  dependant  on pasture. 
The pasture  may be getting  stemmy,  if undergrazed  in May, or it may be too 
short  due to drought  or too high stocking  rate. Typically  lamb  growth  rate may 
decrease  from  280 to 220 g/day  representing  a loss in weaning  weight  of about  
2 kg. This  loss may largely  go un-noticed  on farms  where  lambs  are not weighed  
regularly.  It results  in fewer  lambs  being  ready  for drafting  at weaning  in June 
(when  prices  are generally  higher  than later  in the season) and delays  the average  
sale date by about  2 weeks. Increasing  the weaning  weight  by 2 kg, will increase  
the proportion  of lambs  drafted  at weaning  from 12 or 5% to 24 or 11 % at litter  
sizes of 1.3 and 1.5 respectively.  This delay may seem unimportant  if lamb  
prices  are stable  but may cost about  70p/lamb,  as weaned  lambs  will eat over 
1 kg of DM/day  costing  some 5p/kg  for grazed  grass.
The decline  in lamb growth  at this time is largely  due to the quantity  and 
quality  of the herbage  available  for grazing.  With some adjustment  in sward 
height  it is possible  to keep lamb growth  at a high rate pre-weaning  in June  
(Table  3). The objective  is to offer lambs  grass of high digestibility  similar  to 
that in April/May.  With  set stocking,  tight grazing  up to late May prevents  seed-  
heads  developing  while  an increase  in sward  height  in June  allows  for the growth  
of new leafy material.  The increased  height  in June may be achieved  by applying  
nitrogen  in late  May,  or by increasing  the grazing area,  by for example,  including  
a paddock  cut for silage  in May. With rotational  grazing,  paddocks  could be 
grazed  less-tightly  in June  than earlier  in the season. The provision  of aftergrass  
for weaned  lambs  is desirable,  but few sheep  farmers  would  be in a position  
to have  it available  for ewes  and lambs  in June.  In some  situations  with suitable  
farm layout  it might  be possible  to allow lambs  to forward  creep graze on 
aftergrass  while  ewes are set-stocked.

Creep  feeding
This is an integral  part of early lamb production  and justified  on the basis  
of the higher  lamb  prices  in April  to June,  but is rarely  justified  with mid-season  
systems  and prices.  There  is a response  to creep  feeding  particularly  with tight 
grazing  that would  otherwise  reduce  weaning  weight  (Table  4). At Belclare,  
over 4 seasons,  feeding  250g creep to lambs  between  5 and 14 weeks  [total  
15.75 kg/lamb]  gave a 3.6 liveweight  response  at weaning  with tight paddock

grazing  down  to 4 cm at a F.C.R.  of 4.4 for liveweight  gain. The concentrate  
costs  £2.56/lamb.  The same liveweight  gain in weaned  lambs  would be  obtained  
in about  3 weeks  on moderate  quality  pasture  at less cost. Creep  feeding  could  
be economic  with  February  born lambs if a high  proportion  of lambs was  drafted  
at higher  prices  prevailing  before  the end of June.
Creep  grazing
This is worth  considering  where  a suitable  paddock  grazing  system  is used. 
Given  the opportunity  lambs  will creep graze  from about  7 weeks  of age and 
do so to a large degree  from 10 weeks  to weaning.  Allowing  lambs  access  to 
the best grass ahead  of ewes can help to maintain  high lamb growth  rates in 
June  at a time when they  normally  decline.  At Belclare  over  4 years the response  
to creep  grazing  was similar  to that for creep  feeding  at 250 g/day.  The additional  
response  to creep  feed where  lambs  could  also creep graze was small,  with a 
F.C.R.  of 8.5 for liveweight  gain, indicating  the benefit  of high quality  grass  
for lambs  (Table  4).
Weaning  age
This is normally  at about 14 weeks  of age and any variation  from this date 
would  depend  on grass supply.  If grass is scarce,  with ewes competing  with 
lambs  for available  herbage, weaning  from  about  12 weeks  should  be considered.  
Delaying  weaning  later than 14 weeks  is sometimes  practised  in extensive  
systems  where  there is an abundance  of grass, with a view to drafting  more  
lambs  off the ewes  and avoiding  a post-weaning  check  in lamb growth.  It might  
also be delayed  to facilitate  putting  weaned  lambs  directly  on to aftergrass.  If 
creep  grazing  is practised  there  would  be less need  to wean  early  even in a time  
of grass scarcity.
Post weaning
Lamb  growth  rate on pasture  post-weaning  can vary greatly  and reports  of 
poor growth  rates on farms  are frequent.  Typical  growth-rates  can range  from  
under 100 to over 200 g/day.  Pasture  height,  clover  content,  previous  grazing  
management,  and “clean  pasture ” can all affect the rate of lamb growth.  In 
addition  mineral  deficiencies  such  as cobalt  [and occasionally selenium  or iodine]  
or inadequate  dosing  practises  can cause  problems  Assuming an average  weaning  
weight  of 31 kg, there  will be a range  of lamb  weights  from about  25 to 36 kg.

To add 12 kg to a lamb weighing  31 kg will take 120, 80 or 60 days at growth  
rates of 100, 150 and 200 g/day  respectively.  Sward height  is a useful  indicator  
of the growth  rate to be expected  on pasture.  For set stocking  a height  of 7 to 
9 cm is the target  (Table  5). With rotational  grazing,  lambs  should  graze  down  
to about 6 cm (Table  6). These  results  show a wide range of growth  rates  
depending  on the height  and type of pasture  being  grazed.  Grazing  too tightly  
forces  lambs  to eat poorer  quality  herbage  near the base of the sward,  thereby  
restricting  performance.  The dry ewes can be used to graze  off the grass left 
by lambs  and can act as sward-improvers.  The height  to which  paddocks  are 
grazed  in June will effect  pasture  quality  for the post-weaning  phase.  For this 
reason  the height  of the layer  of grass  above  “stubble  height ” may be a better  
indicator  of the quality  of the pasture  for grazing  than sward  height  only. Poor  
lamb growth  rates on pasture  post-weaning  can be attributed  to low intake  of 
digestible  organic  matter.  As indicated  previously,  intake  by lambs  was in the 
range  of 900 to 1200  G.O.M.  on grass swards.  Intake  will be best when  lambs  
are offered  leafy grass, of high  digestibility  and at a suitable  sward height.  Lamb  
growth  rate on clover  is higher  than on grass due to higher  intake  of the more  
digestible  clover.  Supplementation  with concentrates  on pasture  will give a 
further  increase  in total intake.

(calculated  as kg concentrate  required  per kg extra  carcass  gain)  is in the range  
7 to 10 when  250 to 500 g/lamb  is offered  on short  grass.  (Table  7). At this rate 
of response  the extra  carcass  gain will leave  a margin of profit  over  concentrate  
costs at normal  autumn  lamb  prices.  It gives  an option  to finish  light lambs  on 
the all-grass  farm where  alternative  feeds are not available.
Coping  with grass  shortages
Grass  growth  rate varies from year  to year  and deficits  may occur  at different  
times.  Lambing  dates,  stocking  rates and nitrogen  use are chosen,  generally,  to 
suit the  “normal ” year. Low  temperatures  in Feb/March  as in 1996,  will reduce  
early grass  yield  at turn-out  and may necessitate  supplementary  feeding. If grass  
height  is less than about  4 cm, supplementation  of ewes should  be considered  
at up to 1 kg/day  until grass height  reaches  this target.  Roughage  such as hay 
or silage  can also be offered  on a bare paddock  until growth  improves.
Shortages  in April - after the first grazing  may be overcome  by applying  
nitrogen  after  the first grazing  and adjusting  the area closed  for first cut silage.  
Drought  in May can result  in a grass  deficit  pre-weaning.  In this situation  lambs  
could  be early weaned  at about 12 weeks  and the ewes  confined  to bare pasture  
or housed  and fed hay or silage.  In extreme  situations  creep  feed  can be offered  
to lambs until grass supply  recovers.  The availability  of hay or some baled  
silage  gives  some  flexibility  to the feeding  of ewes  in the post-weaning  period  
up to flushing.
Grass  surplus
This  can also  arise in a period  of rapid  grass  growth in late May/June. Regular  
observations  of grass  height  will indicate  a developing  surplus.  This is difficult  
to control  with set stocking  unless  part of the grazing  area can be fenced  off 
and even then the fenced-off  area [with a grass height  of perhaps  7 to 8 cm]
125
may not easily  fit into a silage-cutting  situation.  A surplus  can be dealt with 
more  easily  with paddock  grazing.  If the sward  height  in the next paddock  for 
grazing  exceeds  10 to 12 cm it can be closed  for silage,  if the next paddock  in 
the grazing  sequence  has 8 to 9 cm of grass.  Controlling  sward  height  at this 
time is critical  for maintaining  pasture  quality  in summer.
Extended  grazing
The possibility  of extending  the grazing  season  and reducing  the indoor  
feeding  period and silage  requirements  is of interest  to sheep  farmers.  At normal 
stocking  rates  pastures  are generally  grazed  down  to the desired  height  of about  
3 cm by December  1 to 15. Ewe  performance  on extended  grazing is satisfactory  
when ewes are given enough  grass for an intake  of 1 kg DM/day  in early to 
mid-pregnancy.  A daily allowance  of 1.6 kg of grass at 65 percent  utilization  
[estimated  by cutting  to ground level]  allows for this intake.  Grazing  for 1 month 
therefore  requires  48 kg DM/ewe.  If stocking  rate is 12.5 ewes/ha,  extended  
grazing  on 1/4 of the area at 50 ewes/ha  for 1 month  requires  2400 kg DM/ha.  
To achieve  this yield, rest from about September  1 to 10 and apply 34 kg n/ 
ha. The area grazed  tightly  by ewes in August  would  be suitable  for closing.  
It can be grazed  in the period  early December  to early January.  Winter  grazing  
even by sheep  will cause  some  pasture  damage  especially  in wet weather  (and 
December  is the wettest  month  of the year).  This will reduce  the yield  of early  
grass by some 25 percent  depending  on grazing  conditions.
Developing  a complete  outwintering  system  [as in New Zealand]  for Irish 
conditions  would  only be  possible  at low stocking  rates. Grass  growth  in Ireland  
in December  to February  is negligible  in most years.  Feeding  1 ewe for a 100 
day winter  requires  about 160 kg/DM.  At 10 ewes/ha  it would  require  a cover  
of grass on the whole  farm of 1600 kg of DM on December  1st. Any grass  
growth  in winter  would  be more  than off-set  by die-back  of this grass.  A stocking  
rate of about  5 to 6 ewes/ha  would  be a more  realistic  target  in a mixed  grazing  
situation.
Grass-clover  swards
The potential  of grass clover  swards  for sheep is well recognised  and 
demonstrated  at Knockbeg  and elsewhere.  With moves  towards  REPS style  
farming  and extensification  the potential  to exploit  clover-based  systems  would  
appear  to be greater  now than in the recent  past. Difficulties  to be overcome

include  the low level of clover  in many permanent  pastures  and the higher  level 
of grassland  management  skill required  to manage  clover  swards.  Clover  can 
be established  reliably  if reseeding,  but better  guidelines  are required  for 
introducing,  maintaining  and increasing  clover  in permanent  pastures.
Extensification
This involves  reducing  stocking  rates with corresponding  reduction  in the 
use of fertiliser,  including  nitrogen.  At Belclare  a system  is being run on old 
pasture  at a stocking  rate of 111/4 ewes/ha  and a N input of 90 kg/ha,  levels  
appropriate  for REPS.  Extended  grazing  is provided  for ewes for I month  up 
to about  January  10. Experience  with this system  would  indicate  that it is as 
difficult  to operate  at this level of intensity  as it is at higher  stocking  rates with 
corresponding  higher  N input.
April  lambing
A majority  of lambs are born in March,  leading  to peak sales in July to 
September.  Lambing  in late April with a view to selling  in October-December  
offers  the possibility  of reducing  seasonality  of supply.  The system  is used to 
a small  extent  in Britain  and to a lesser  extent  in Ireland.  Ewes  could  be at  grass  
for a few weeks  pre-lambing,  thereby  reducing  concentrate  requirements  for 
ewes,  but this would  be offset  by the extra  concentrates  required  on an all-grass  
farm to finish  lambs  on pasture  or silage.  Target  dates would  be lambing  April  
25, weaning  August  I (at 14 weeks)  at 30 kg, weighing  38 kg at the end of 
September  and finishing  at 44 kg in mid-November.  Difficulties  anticipated,  
include  maintaining  pasture  quality  for lambs in June/July  pre-weaning  and 
planning  to have sufficient  grass  when  mating  ewes  in late November. A small-  
scale trial is in its early stages  at Belclare.
Mixed  grazing
The benefits  of mixed  cattle/sheep  grazing  have been well demonstrated  
and different  systems  developed.  Better  growth  rates and earlier  sale dates are 
some  of the benefits  with lambs.  There  appears  to be scope  for the widespread  
adoption  of this system  on drystock  farms.
Silage  quality
If ewes are wintered  on silage,  quality  is important  with a view to reducing  
concentrate  requirements  for ewes.  High yield with a long growth  period  must  
be offset against  the extra concentrate  requirements  with a silage of lower  
digestibility.  Attention  to quality  is also important  now with baled silage.  The 
cost of concentrate  for ewes could  vary from £2 to £5/ewe  for high  or moderate  
quality  silage  respectively.
Cleaner  grazing  systems
Lamb growth  rate pre and post-weaning  is generally  better  on clean  pasture,  
that is, those  with a low worm  population.  Some  of the benefit  of mixed  grazing
127
may be attributed  to a lower  worm  population in lambs.  Coccidiosis,  Nematodirus  
and other  worms  can cause  considerable  problems  on some  farms. The area  cut 
for silage  on a sheep  farm is smaller  than for cattle  systems  and this limits  the 
scope  for alternating  grazing  and cutting  areas.  However  a well planned  approach 
to dosing  of ewes and lambs,  combined  with alternating  grazing  and cutting  
areas where  possible  may merit more attention  in the future,  at a time of 
increasing  concern  for issues of animal  welfare,  use of chemicals  and food 
quality.

Introduction
Grass,  either  grazed  or conserved,  accounts  for 90-95%  of the energy  
requirements  of sheep  compared  to 65%  and 80% for dairy  cows  and beef  cattle  
respectively.  Therefore  the opportunity  for increasing  the reliance  on grass is 
limited  compared  to other  livestock  enterprises.  However,  because  of its high 
contribution,  any improvement  in the efficiency  of production  and utilisation  
of grass  would  significantly  increase  the profitability  of sheep  farming.  Grazed  
grass  is undoubtedly  the cheapest  feed for ruminants  with the cost of silage  and 
concentrate  supplements  three and seven times higher  respectively.  
Unfortunately,  grass  does not grow  all year round  and conserved  forage  has to 
be provided  during  the winter  period.  Furthermore,  there are times  of the year 
when the nutritive  value  of forage  is inadequate  to supply  the animal  with its 
energy  and protein  demands  or the intake  of bulky  food is restricted  due to the 
ewe ’s condition  e.g. late pregnancy  and early lactation.
Greater  reliance  on legume-based  pastures  is regarded  as the best way of 
improving  the efficiency  of sheep  production  (Hopkins  et ai, 1994).  Grass-  
clover  swards  can reduce  production  costs by saving  money  on N-fertilizer.  
Improved  lamb growth  rates are also likely  due to the higher  feeding  value  of 
the clover.
In this paper  ways of improving  the efficiency  of sheep  production  from  
grass are discussed.  These  include  grazing  management,  use of grass-clover  
pastures,  choice  of grass and clover  varieties.  Evidence  from systems  studies  
and farm survey  data is also examined.  Current  research  to improve  our 
knowledge  of diet selection  and grazing  behaviour  is discussed  in relation  to 
the implications  of the findings  in the quest  for more  efficient  sheep  production  
from grassland.
Sward  hbight
Development  of grazing  management  systems  based  on sward  surface  height  
is regarded  as the most  significant  technological  advancement  of recent  times.  
Although  sward  height  guidelines  have been  promoted  for more  than a decade,  
few farmers  effect  control  by direct  measurements  on the sward.  They  resulted  
from detailed  component  research  by scientists  at the Animal  and Grassland  
Research  Institute  at Hurley  in Berkshire  and at the Hill Farming  Research  
Organisation  in Edinburgh.  Plant physiologists  and animal  nutritionists  made  
detailed  measurements  of the growth  and structure  of grazed  swards  and of the
129
Fig 1 - Seasonal  pattern  of recommended  sward  heights
grazing  behaviour  and intake  of herbage  by the sheep  grazing  them.  These  studies 
led to a new understanding  of the inter-relationships  of swards  and grazing  
animals.  By managing  continuously  grazed  pastures  at specific  sward  heights,  
high levels  of utilisation  with optimum  herbage  growth  and animal  intake were  
achieved  (Maxwell  and Treacher,  1987).  The annual  profile  of sward  height  
recommended  for upland  systems  is shown  in Figure  1.
The influence  of sward  height  on the intake  and growth  of weaned  lambs  
was studied  at Bronydd  Mawr.  Results  (Table  1) show  that higher  intakes,  and 
possibly  greater  scope for selecting  higher  quality  feed, at the higher  sward 
heights  give  better  individual  lamb daily  liveweight  gains.  However,  the higher  
sward  heights  carried  less lambs  per hectare. These  data  show  that farmers  could  
use sward  height  as a management  tool to control  weaned  lamb growth  rates  
and hence  date of achieving  finished  target  weights.

The use of white  clover  in pastures
The use of white  clover  in grazing  systems  has several  advantages.  It is a 
legume  that fixes nitrogen  from  the atmosphere  and thus  reduces  the requirement
130
for mineral  N fertiliser  and pollution  potential  (Cowling,  1982;  Parsons  et ai, 
1991).  Under  cutting,  grass and clover  swards  have been shown  to give DM 
yields  equivalent  to monocultures  of grass  receiving  200 kg N annum (Morrison,  
1981). Clover  is readily  eaten by sheep and the performance  of animals  
consuming  clover  is enhanced  compared  with those eating  grass (Thomson,  
1979; 1984 ). In indoor  feeding  studies,  where  grass and clover  were cut daily  
and fed to ewes and lambs  in set proportions  (Gibb  and Treacher,  1983; 1984),  
animals  were  found  to perform  better  up to 100%  clover  in their  diet. Gibb  and 
Treacher  (1983;  1984) concluded  that this increased  performance  was mainly  
brought  about  because  sheep  consuming  clover  had higher  intakes,  because  of 
the higher  rate of digestion  and rate of passage  of the legume,  compared  with 
grass (Moseley  and Jones, 1984).  There  was also some increase  in N supply  
to the animals  eating  clover  and it has been suggested  (Thomson,  1984) that 
the products  of digestion  from clover  may be used more  efficiently  than those  
from grass.
We now have to ask the question  ‘How can these  advantages  for clover  be 
incorporated  into grazing  systems?  To answer  this question  it is first necessary  
to develop  an understanding  of plant to plant  (i.e. clover  vs grass)  and animal/  
plant interactions.
First,  we tested  whether  grazing  sheep,  as opposed  to animals  being  offered  
feed indoors,  also perform  better  on clover  than on grass pastures  (Penning  et 
ai, 1995).  Lactating  Scottish  Halfbred  ewes  with their  twin Suffolk  cross  lambs  
were  continuously  stocked  on monocultures  of white  clover  (cv Huia)  or ryegrass  
(cv Melle)  maintained  at sward  surface  heights  (SSH)  of 3 cm or 6 cm for each  
herbage  species.  On the tall (C6) and short (C3) clover  swards  the lambs  grew

at 366 and 284 g/hd/d,  whilst  on the tall (G6) and short (G3) grass  swards  the 
lambs  grew at 312  and 252 g/hd/d. A  clear  advantage  for the clover  can be seen 
(Figure  2). The changes  in liveweight  of the ewes are shown  in Figure  3 and, 
again,  the advantage  for clover  can be seen clearly.
Second  we tested  whether,  given  the opportunity,  grazing  sheep would select  
a diet of 100%  clover.  This  has relevance,  as in practical  grazing  systems  animals  
usually  have the opportunity  to select  between  grass and clover.  To measure  
their preference  (i.e. selection  with environmental  constraints  removed)  we 
established  monocultures  of clover  grown  alongside  monocultures  of grass  and 
allowed  the sheep  to select  voluntarily  between  the two herbage  species.  They  
were  offered  clover  and grass,  maintained  at 6 cm SSH, in proportions  by area 
of clover  to grass of: 20:80,  50:50  or 80:20.  These  areas of clover  and grass  
offered  were sufficiently  large so that monospecific  diets could have been  
obtained  by the animals.
The sheep  selected  a diet containing  70 to 80% clover  with lactating  ewes  
tending  to select a greater  proportion  of clover  than the dry ewes (Table  2. 
Parsons  et ai, 1994).  It is interesting  to note that animals  selected  a mixed  diet, 
although  we have shown  that they would  have performed  better if they had 
eaten  only clover.  There  was also a circadian  pattern  of selection  with animals  
tending  to consume  more grass in the evening.  The criteria  by which  animals  
asses  optimum  feeding  strategy  are obviously  not the same  as those  of farmers  
e.g. to maximise  growth  rate and production  .
A detailed  knowledge  of how sheep graze grass, compared  with clover, 
would  enable  us to understand  how the increased  performance  on clover  com­
pared  with grass  was achieved  and give insights  into creating  possible  manage-

management  strategies  for grazing  systems.  To investigate  these aspects,  the 
ingestive  behaviour  of lactating  Scottish  Halthred  ewes grazing  monocultures  
of grass and clover  at different  SSHs was monitored.
Sheep  were found  to have greater  bite masses  in terms of fresh and dry 
material  on clover  than grass  (Figure  4, Penning  et al., 1995).  Prehension  biting  
rate (i.e. bites  where  material  is harvested  from  the sward)  was greater  on clover  
than grass and mastication  rate (jaw movements  associated  with chewing  the 
material  harvested  with a prehension  bite, but not rumination)  were lower  on 
clover  than grass (Figure  5). As there  is a fixed upper  limit to total eating  jaw 
movements,  and prehension  and mastication  bites are mutually  exclusive,  this 
explains  how differences  in intake  rate can occur.  In fact intake  rate was higher  
on clover  than grass  (5.3 vs 3.9 g DM/min  grazing)  at an SSH of 6 cm (Figure
6). The animals  spent  less time grazing  on the clover  than the grass  but in spite

of this they still achieved  greater  daily  intakes  of DM of clover  than grass  (Figure
7). Another  advantage  associated  with  clover  was, that per kg of herbage  ingested, 
only 33 min ruminating  was required  for clover  whilst  83 min was required  to 
ruminate the grass.  Thus  overall,  animals  grazing  clover  had higher  intakes  but 
required  to spend  less time grazing  and ruminating  than those eating  grass.
In addition  to enabling  animals  to achieve  higher  intakes,  clover  has 
nutritional  advantages  over grass  and these  are shown  in Figure  8. This Figure  
shows  clearly  that clover  maintained  a higher  digestibility  than grass and had 
a higher  N content.
The above  examples  have illustrated  the benefits  in output  per individual  
animal  for clover  compared  with grass monocultures,  but output  per hectare  
from clover,  grass and grass-clover  mixtures  must also be considered,  as must  
N losses  to the enviromnent.

supported  about  74% of the animal  production  of grass swards  receiving  420 
kg/N/annum  (Orr et ai, 1995), whilst  the grass sward  receiving  0 N only 
supported  50% of the production.  But the clover  sward and the grass sward  
receiving  420 kg N gave  higher  nitrate  concentrations  in soil solution  at 60 cm 
depth.
Mixtures  of grass-clover  offer  a valuable, low  cost and productive  alternative  
to fertilised  grass swards  with output  from grass-clover  swards  being about  
80% of swards  receiving  200 kg N.
Reliability  of grass-clover  swards
Systems  based on grass-clover  swards  are often seen as carrying  a high 
level of risk, in that year-to-year  variation  in herbage  production  and livestock  
output is greater  than  from N-fertilized  grass,  and this is often  cited  as the main  
reason  for their  non-adoption  by farmers. Evidence  from  a number  of published  
animal  production  comparisons  show that, if anything,  output  between  years  
is less variable  from grass-clover  than from N-fertilized  grass swards.  Over  6 
years  at Bronydd  Mawr  lamb production  from  grass-clover  pasture  had a range  
of 80-114%  compared  to a range  of 75-125%  for grass  given  200 kg N/ha  (Davies  
etai, 1992).
Low  productivity  of grass-clover  swards  at critical  times  of the grazing  season 
is also a constraint  which  may  limit  their  adoption.  Poor  growth  of grass-clover  
pastures  in spring  can be overcome  in a number  of ways. Strategic  use of N 
fertilizer  may be possible  without  a major  detrimental  affect  on clover  content.  
Alternatively,  allocation  of part of the farm to N-fertilized  grass may provide  
additional herbage  at this critical  time.  Another  option  is to change  feed demand  
by altering  lambing  date. Progress  has also been made in breeding  clover  
varieties with  improved  winter  hardiness  and spring  growth  (Rhodes  and Webb, 
1993).
Grazing  management  for grass-clover
Successful  grassland  management  involves  making  decisions  to obtain  a 
balanced  compromise  between  the requirements  for maintaining  a desired  level 
of pasture  productivity  on the one hand and meeting  the nutritional  demands  
for a given level of animal  production  on the other. In grass-clover  pastures,  
allowance  must  also be made  for the competitive  interactions  between  the grass  
and clover  components  with  their  relative  growth  rates  varying  at different  times  
of the year.
The sward  height  guidelines  discussed  above were devised  on perennial  
ryegrass  swards  receiving  high inputs  of fertilizer  N. In recent  years, the 
suitability  of these  sward  height  recommendations  for grass-clover  swards  has 
been investigated. In general,  over  most  of the growing  season  there is no reason  
to deviate  from the sward  height  profdes  as illustrated  in Figure 1.
Extensification  policies  of the EU might  result  in systems  with  sward  height  
profiles  which  are higher  than those regarded  as the most efficient  for animal  
production  on a per hectare  basis. The consequences  of doing so is under  
investigation  at Bronydd  Mawr.  Results  over the first 3 years indicate  that the
137
higher  sward heights  (2 cm higher  than recommended  profiles)  are creating  
pastures  with a lower  clover  content  and poorer  feeding  value.
Research  in New  Zealand  (Hay  and Baxter,  1989)  has highlighted  the effect  
of grazing management  on white clover productivity  and morphology.  
In a 5-year  trial on a 20-year  old sward,  clover  developed  better  with 12 weeks  
continuous  stocking  in spring  rather  than with rotational  grazing.  The resulting  
high clover  density  was best converted  into animal-available  herbage  by 
rotational grazing  during the  subsequent  summer, a time  of year when  conditions  
favour  clover  growth.  Continuous  stocking  in spring,  from lambing  until 
weaning,  followed  by rotational  grazing  on a 4-week  basis  until autumn  is now 
common  practice  on New Zealand  sheep  farms.
Manipulation  of sward  clover  content  is also possible  by using different  
livestock  species.  At Bronydd  Mawr  in a study run jointly  with the Macaulay  
Land Use Research  Institute  the beneficial  effects  of grazing  by suckler  cows  
and calves  in spring  rather  than by ewes  and lambs  resulted  in superior  growth  
rates  of weaned  lambs  that subsequently  grazed  the swards  (Table  4). This was 
due to a  higher  clover  content  in the cattle  grazed  pastures  (Wright  et al., 1992).

Grass  and clover  varieties
A number  of studies  in recent  years  have compared  lamb production  from  
swards  of contrasting  perennial  ryegrasses in the UK. Three  of these  experiments  
at IGER  Bronydd  Mawr  and North  Wyke  and at the Scottish  Agricultural College  
in Edinburgh  included  a comparison  of tetraploid  and diploid  late-flowering  
varieties  of perennial  ryegrass.  The results  were  consistent  and showed  significant 
better  lamb performance  from tetraploids.  In the SAC  experiment  (Swift  et al, 
1996),  lamb  output  averaged  over 5 years  was 12% higher  from Condesa  than 
from Contender  (1112 v 995 kg/ha).  At Bronydd  Mawr  over 6 years output  
from Meltra  was 13% more than from Aberystwyth  S23 (910 x 805 kg/ha). 
Based  on current  sale price for lamb the extra  production  from the tetraploids  
is worth over £100 per hectare.
The above  results  are from grass-only  swards  receiving  around  200 N kg/ 
ha. In both experiments,  grass-clover  pastures  of the varieties  were also 
compared.  At Bronydd  Mawr  Meltra-S184  gave 16% more lamb output  than 
S23-S184  swards  (786 v 678 kg/ha).  Detailed  studies  of the clover  in these 
swards  revealed  that the tetraploid  Meltra  was much  more  compatible with clover 
than the diploid  S23. Averaged  over the 6 years mean  clover  stolon  density  on
138
Meltra-S  184 was 61 m/m^ compared  to 37 m/m^ on S23-S 184 swards.  Mean  
clover  content  of the herbage  was 14 and 8% for the Meltra  and S23 swards  
respectively.  The better  compatibility  of the tetraploid  Meltra  was attributed  to 
a lower total grass tiller density  allowing  greater  development  of clover  
(Fothergill  and Davies,  1993).
There is little information  on the effect of clover  variety  on animal  
productivity.  However,  one experiment  was carried  out by IGER which  was 
duplicated  at Bronydd  Mawr  in the uplands  and at Plas Gogerddan,  Aberystwyth  
in the lowlands.  Lamb  production  was compared  from  ryegrass-clover  pastures  
of three contrasting  white clover  varieties  over 3 years and the results  are 
presented  in Table  5. (Davies  et ai, 1995).

Averaged  for both sites, output  of lamb was 11 % more  from small-leaved  
Aberystwyth  SI84 than from medium-leaved  Grasslands  Huia. Performance  
on the other  small-leaved  variety  AberEndura  was poorest.  This suggests  that 
it is not simply  a question  of leaf size. The differences  were associated  with 
growth habit  (AberEndura  being  very prostrate)  and its affect  on the availability  
of the clover  component  of the sward  to the animal.  Again  these differences  
between  SI84 and Huia in monetary  terms  are equivalent  to around  £ 100/ha.  
The high output  achieved  in this study is further  confirmation  of the potential  
of grass-clover  swards without  applied  N in sheep  production systems.  However, 
as with perennial  ryegrass  choice of the appropriate  clover variety is 
important.
Systems  studies
A number  of sheep  systems  studies  have been carried  out by IGER  since  
the early 1980 ’s. These  have involved  comparison  of breeds,  stocking  rates,  
ewedamb  ratios, nitrogen  levels and sward height  profiles.  By using pre­
determined  sward  height  decision  rules to adjust  grazing  area and the necessity  
to introduce  supplementary  concentrate  or forage  feeds with areas surplus  to 
grazing  requirement  being  conserved  as silage,  it is possible  to determine whether  
a system  of production  is self-sufficient  in terms of the provision  of winter  
feed. With detailed  monitoring  of all inputs  and outputs  it is possible  to carry  
out a financial  comparison  of the treatments.
139
Since 1988 attention  has been focused  on the development  of low-input  
sheep  systems  based  on white  clover.  Results  of a 4-year  study  comparing  grass-  
clover  pastures  receiving  200 or 50 kg N/ha are presented  in Table 6. Three  
stocking  rates (9, 12 and 15 ewes/ha)  were compared  at the lower  fertilizer  
level and two rates (15 and 18 ewes/ha)  at the higher  level.  By closing  surplus  
areas  for silage,  the grazed  swards  were  maintained  at 3.5 cm until weaning  on 
17 July and at 5 cm for ewes and 6 cm for lambs  until mid September.  Lambs  
were finished  at 34 kg liveweight.
Total lamb output  closely  followed  stocking  rate down  from 801 to 449 kg/ 
ha. Feed self-sufficiency  in terms  of silage  made per ewe varied  from less than 
100% to nearly  300% of the annual  requirement  of 120 kg DM per ewe,  
increasing  with reduced  stocking  rate.
Financial  appraisal  of the contrasting  systems  suggests  that returns  are highly 
dependent  on relative  sheep and feed prices  and subsidy  levels.

Farm  survey  data
The Meat  and Livestock  Commission  (MLC)  operates  a recording  scheme  
for commercial  sheep  producers  and the physical  and financial  data collected  
is used as part of a farm advisory  package  known  as Flockplan.'Recently  the 
rights  of Flockplan has been assigned  to Signet,  a joint  venture  company between  
MLC and the Scottish  Agricultural  College.  The data are published  in Sheep 
Yearbook  annually  which gives information  for different  types of sheep  
enterprises  in the lowlands,  uplands  and hills (MLC,  1995).  Comparisons  are 
made  between  the top and bottom  third and average  producers  in terms of gross  
margins/ha.  The principal  components  affecting  profitability  and their relative 
importance  in upland  and lowland  spring  lambing  flocks  in 1985 and 1994 are 
shown  in Table  7.

These  values  highlight  the changes  that have taken place in recent  years

Concluding  remarks
Evidence  presented  in this paper  shows  that opportunity  exists  for improving  
the efficiency  of sheep  production  from grassland.  Although  current  EU policy  
is geared  towards  putting  a ceiling  on total production,  there is scope for 
individual  producers  to maintain  and even improve  the profitability  of their  
enterprise.  Reduction in production  costs  is possible  by greater  reliance  on grazed  
grass.  More  use of white  clover  is unquestionably  the key factor  in this area. 
Plant  breeding  has a part  to play in developing  improved  varieties  of both  grasses  
and clovers  with  better  spring  growth  and higher  feeding  values.  Better  utilization  
of grazed  grass  is obviously  another  means  of improving  efficiency.  Adoption  
by the industry  of sward  height  guidelines  would  help in this respect.
Current  MAFF  funded  research  at IGER is examining  the mechanisms  
governing  the productivity  and persistence  of white  clover  in grazed  pastures  
with the objective  of devising  more  precise  management  guidelines.  On-going  
studies  on dietary  preference  and the grazing  behaviour  of ruminants  should  
improve  our knowledge  of these  aspects  which again could  lead to more  precise  
management  regimes.
In the long term, although  consumption  of sheep  meat is on the decline  at 
home,  demand  is predicted  to increase  with the growing  world  population  and 
the improved  purchasing  power  of the Pacific  basin  countries.  However,  to be 
competitive  on the world market  it is imperative  that Northern  Hemisphere  
producers  improve  the efficiency  of their sheep  production  systems.

Summary
Profitability  on New Zealand  sheep  farms  is at present  very low. Individual  
farmers  are managing  up to 3000 sheep  through  having  the appropriate  farm  
facilities  and stock and the judicious  use of outside  contractors.  To increase  
profitability  sheep farmers  need to improve  animal  performance  at stocking  
rates that give high utilisation  of grass. One of the keys is high producing  
ryegrass/clover  pastures  that are maintained  at high  quality  for better  lamb  growth  
during  summer.  Production  research  carried  out in the past has provided  this 
information  but it needs to be more effectively  extended  to farmers,  future  
issues in sheep farming  include  increasing  product  returns  through  better  
marketing,  improved  animal  performance,  more  effective  extension  of research  
results  and use of high fecundity  sheep  breeds.
Short  history
To understand  the current  position  and future  direction  of the New  Zealand  
sheep meat industry  it is necessary  to briefly  recount  events  since the early  
1970 ’s. Up to 1973, most of the lamb and mutton  produced  was exported  to 
Great Britain  at a reasonably  consistent  high price  and sheep  farming  was very 
profitable.  In 1973, Britain  joined  the EEC and thereafter  New Zealand  was 
reliant  on ever  diminishing  annual sheep  meat  quotas  for entry  into a previously  
unrestricted  market.  At about  the same  time the first of several  increases  in the 
price of oil occurred  and the inflation  rate increased  from a historical  low 1- 
2% to 15-20%  through  the 1970 ’s. New Zealand  developed  other markets,  
notably  the Middle-East  for sheep meat but returns  were lower than those  
received  from Britain  and fluctuated  greatly  from year to year.
In response  to a situation  in the late 1970 ’s where  many  sheep  farmers  were  
not making  a profit,  the then conservative  National  Government  introduced  
subsidies on sheep  meat  in the form  of Supplementary  Minimum  Prices  (SMP ’) 
paid out on individual  carcasses.  By 1984  SMF ’s made up to 50%  ot the income  
on sheep  farms.  As a results  of SMP ’s, sheep  numbers  increased  dramatically  
from 50 to 70 million,  farm profitability  improved  and the price of intensive  
sheep farm land doubled  from £600 to £1000  per hectare  (£240  - £4000  per 
acre).
When the opposition  Labour  party came to government  in 1984, one of 
their  first acts as part of their  market  policies  was to abolish  SMF ’s. At the  same  
time farm interest  rates increased  up to 25% and inflation,  which had been 
government  controlled  in the early 1980 ’s increased  from 3 to 18%.
143
From 1984  to 1987,  sheep  farming  went  through  a major  crisis.  Lamb  prices  
were halved,  the price of land fell dramatically  and many sheep farmers,  
especially  those  that had borrowed  large  sums at previously  low interest  rates,  
were forced  to sell.
By the early 1990s,  the financial  position  of sheep  farmers  had improved  
due to lower inflation  and interest  rates. In addition,  falling  sheep numbers  
without  a corresponding  reduction in the slaughtering  capacity  of meat  processing  
works  meant  that companies  were  having  to pay premiums  to achieve  throughput, 
thus increasing  lamb prices  over and above  the market  return.  As a result,  
company  profitability  was eroded  and in 1994 two large companies  went into 
receivership.  The remaining  companies  could  therefore  procure  animals  without  
having  to pay premiums  to the farmer  and prices  dropped.  Export  prices  for 
dairy and wood  products  increased  in the mid 1990 ’s and the huge  demand  for 
more land led to an increase  in the price paid for sheep  farms.  These  factors  
have  all contributed  to the current  position  where  sheep  farmers  still have good  
equity  in their land but at least half are failing  to achieve  a profit.  Low wool 
and beef  returns  also contributed  to this. Since 1984, national  sheep  numbers  
have declined  from 70 to 47 million.
Since  the financial  trauma  of the mid 1980 ’s, the attitude  of farmers  towards  
farming  has changed  considerably.  They are now more business  like and 
searching  for more profitable  options  and alternatives.
Financial  status
In Table 1, the 1995/1996  budget  for an intensive  sheep  farm in Southland  
(south  of the South  Island)  is shown.  This farm is regarded  as average  for this 
farm class and is monitored  annually.  Farm area is 200 ha wintering,  13 stock  
units per hectare  (one stock unit is one ewe equivalent).  Lambing  percentage  
is 120%,  lamb price £14 and wool weight  5.0 kg per ewe.
Although  Southland  has the coolest  weather  in New  Zealand (average winter  
temperature  5°C, summer  temperature  20°C) it is still at a more favourable  
latitude  (by 5-10°)  than Ireland.  When  the very low level of profit  is combined  
with a high land price (£1000  per hectare),  return  on capital  is very low (less 
than 1%).

Variable  costs £30,000
Fixed costs £24,000
Profit £2,000
Management  calendar
The timing  of major  management  events  follows  a similar  seasonal  pattern  
to Ireland.  In autumn  (March  to May),  rams are put out for mating  in early to 
mid April.  From  the end of mating  in late May ewes  are wintered  outdoors  on
144
rationed  autumn  saved  pasture  or brassica  crops  with some  hay and silage  fed 
to make  up a maintenance  allowance.  Lambing  begins  in early September  with  
lambs  weaned  in December.  Silage  and hay is harvested  in December  and January  
and lambs  are finished  during  January  to March.  Shearing  is normally  carried  
out every eight months  (April,  December,  August).
Management  of large  flocks
In response  to the large  reduction in the inflation  adjusted  returns  from sheep  
since the early 1970 ’s, farm size and sheep  numbers  per intensive  sheep  farm  
have increased  from 170 ha and 2000 stock units to 200 ha and 2600 stock  
units.  As a cost saving  measure,  farm  workers  have  also not been  replaced  with 
the results  that the farmer/owner  is now managing  up to 2500  sheep.  This has 
been achieved  through  working  longer  hours, having  appropriate  farm  facilities  
and stock for a low labour  input and the Judicious  use of outside  and casual  
labour.
Farm  layouts  have  been  modified  with more  intensive  subdivision  (5-10  ha 
paddocks)  and central  races  to ease movement  of stock  between  paddocks  and 
to the sheep  yards. On larger  farms  there will be more than one set of yards  
to minimise  the time taken to sort stock. Quick  and easy to erect temporary  
electric fences are  used  to ration feed  during winter.  Four  wheel vehicles  (ATVs) 
are used to quickly  move  over even hilly areas  of the farm. Sheep  are grouped  
into large  mobs  to minimise  the number  of mobs  to shift. Through  selection  and 
culling  most  sheep  are now easy  care being  able to lamb  without  assistance  and 
with minimal shepherding. Pregnancy scanning  is used  to identify multiple  births  
so they can be managed  separately.  Ewes are set stocked  at lambing  and are 
rotated  when lambs  are large enough  to shift easily.  Contractors  are generally  
used for operations  such as shearing,  crutching,  dipping,  fencing,  making  hay 
and silage  and ground  preparation  for crops.  This  reduces the need for the farmer  
to own expensive  machinery.  For labour  intensive  operations  sucb as tailing  
and weaning,  three or four neighbouring  farmers  will combine  to help each  
other.
Profitable  pasture  management
In an unfavourable  outside  economic  environment,  sheep  farms  have  to be 
managed  very effectively  and efficiently  to achieve  a desirable  level of profit  
and remain  in sheep  farming.  Stocking  rates need to be high enough  (12-15  
ewes/ha)  so that the maximum  proportion  of grass grown  (80-90%)  is utilised  
by grazing  animals.  At these stocking  rates,  high animal performance  is essential.  
Lambing  percentage  (lambs  weaned  in proportion  to ewes mated)  needs  to be 
at least 150%,  lamb  carcass  weight  15-17 kg (by end of March)  and wool weight  
averaging  at least 6 kg/ewe.
To achieve  this performance,  the important  pasture  management  principles  
are;
1. Maintenance  of high producing  ryegrass/clover  pastures  (12-14  tonne  DM/  
ha/yr)  that persist  for at least 20 years before  renewal.
145
2. Appropriate  grazing  and conservation  management  to maximise  pasture  
utilisation  and transfer  feed from  high (late  spring/summer)  to low (winter/  
early spring)  pasture  growth  periods.
3. Maximising  pasture  quality  during  late spring/summer  to finish lambs  at 
desirable  carcass  weights  to maximise  returns  through  the use of cattle  to 
control  pasture  plus well timed  pasture  conservation.
4. On-farm  monitoring  of pasture  cover,  ewe and lamb  liveweights  and careful 
financial  budgeting.
Role of research
As in Ireland,  most of the research  related  to sheep  farming  was focussed  
on achieving  more  production  up to the late 1980 ’s. Since  then there has been 
a change  in emphasis  towards  the Government  funding  research  on 
environmental  effects,  food  quality and safety  and genetic  manipulation of plants 
and animals.  At present  there  is a large  body of production  research  information  
that requires  assembling  in an appropriate  form (easy to read booklets,  
information  sheets,  decision  support  computer  models)  for use by advisors  and 
farmers.
Important  research  that has shown  how efficiencies  in grass and flock  
management  enhance  profits  include:
1. Identification  of the correct  level of pasture  cover  and quality  to optimise  
sheep performance  at critical  times (Ewes  during  lactation  and mating;  
lambs  from weaning  to slaughter).  Farmers  assess  pasture  cover  in each 
paddock  and use this to feed budget.
2. Understanding  the grazing  management  necessary  to achieve  these  
appropriate  levels.  Rotational  grazing  is essential  to ration  and build-up  
pasture  especially  at high  stocking  rates.  Set-stocking  or continuous  grazing  
can be used when pasture  growth  exceeds  animal  demand  to achieve  
maximum  live weight  gain or wool growth.  Pasture  conservation  is an 
important  tool in maintaining  pasture  quality.
3. Identifying  the soil pH and nutrient  levels  (P, K, S) required  for optimum  
economic  returns  for an individual  farm.  This allows  profit  to be maximised  
and any adverse  environmental  effects  to be minimised.  Modelling  of results 
has been carried  out and a decision  support  computer  model  developed.  
There  are also economic  benefits  to be gained  from the use of nitrogen  
fertiliser  (up to 50 kg N ha applied  from late autumn  to early spring).
4. Solutions  and remedies  for animal  health  problems  have been developed.  
Anthelmintic  drench  resistance  in lambs  has been countered  by on-farm  
monitoring  of faecal egg numbers  and judicial  use of different  drench  
families,  identification of pasture  species  that have lower  worm  egg burdens 
and breeding  of sheep  for tolerance  to internal  parasites.  Extender  drench  
capsules  are used in ewes  for prolonged  protection  against  internal  parasites. 
Trace  element  deficiencies  have  been identified  and the appropriate  animal 
or fertiliser  treatment  (e.g. application  of selenium  prills in fertiliser)  
developed.  The role of fungal  endophyte  in ryegrass  causing  ryegrass
146
5.staggers  but also preventing  plant death  from Argentine  stem weevil  has 
been recognised and low or high endophyte  ryegrass  bred.  Biological control 
measures  for grass  grub and Argentine  stem weevil  have been developed.  
Now specialist  pasture  cultivars  for summer  growth  in low rainfall  areas  
(cocksfoots,  fescues)  and finishing  lambs  (chicory)  have been released.
Improving  lamb  carcass  quality
These  technologies  include  newly  introduced  use of breeds  such as Texels  
to improve  carcass  conformation,  reducing  overfats  by early selection  of high  
lean growth  potential  lambs,  slaughtering  lambs  at appropriate  carcass  weights  
(15-17  kg) to maximise  the proportion  of lean meat and provide  the correct  
sized cut and minimisation  of pre-slaughter  stress in handling  animals.
Future  issues
1.To regain  the viability  of sheep  farming,  returns  per lamb must increase  
from the current  £14 (cost of production)  to at least £20 through  better  
marketing  of New Zealand ’s ‘clean green ’ image  to the more affluent  end 
of the market.  All year round supply  of lambs  will become  important.
2. In addition  to better marketing,  sheep farmers  need to take up existing  
management  technologies  to increase  animal  performance.
3. Sheep  farmers  have  to adopt  management  strategies  that through minimising  
nutrient  loss and erosion  are at least possible  risk to the environment.  This 
is important  both  for internal  local  government  and marketing  requirements.
4. There is a need for high fecundity  sheep breeds  (e.g. East Friesian)  to 
increase  the number  of lambs  finished  per ewe wintered  and take maximum  
advantage  of the pasture  growth  pattern.  Better  milk production  from these  
ewes will also lead to higher  carcass  weights.
5. Systems  for extension  of research  results  have to be developed  to replace  
the old Government  extension  services.  Monitor  farms where  groups  of 
farmers  pool information  and research  is adopted  to meet  farm  goals  is one 
method  that is proving  successful  in New Zealand.  Up to 25% more  profit  
annually  has been achieved  on these farms.

Producing  Lambs  from Grass
D. BOURNS  
Eyrecourt,  Co. Galway.
Our main objective  is to maximise  lamb output  per ewe making  the best 
use of the grass available  on the farm, while  keeping  costs to a minimum.
All grass  farm
The farm is an all-grass  farm with deep  soil, good land for producing  grass  
especially  in a dry summer.  The pastures  are mainly  permanent,  while  some,  
especially  those used for cutting  silage,  have been re-seeded  in the past 8-10 
years. Pastures  are based  mainly  on perennial  ryegrasses.
We run a mixed  stock  enterprise  of beef cattle  and sheep,  densely  stocked  
on good grass.  The farm is somewhat  exposed,  especially  to the north.  We are 
making  strident  efforts  to plant  shelter  belts  and hedges,  but the process  is very 
slow.
Ewe breeds
Flock  size is 1030 ewes consisting  of 800 matures  and 230 hoggets.  The 
ewes  are mainly  Greyfaces  (Border  Leicester  x Scottish  Blackface)  and Mules  
(Bluefaced  Leicester  x Scottish  Blackface)  bought  as ewe lambs  in Co. Antrim.
We buy light ewe lambs  (30-40  kg liveweight)  in late August;  they are not 
put to the ram until the following  year. In our experience  the quality  of the Co. 
Antrim  ewe is very good.  The ewes  are double  vaccinated  with  Hep-P  on arrival  
at the farm and are dosed  for fluke  and worms.  They spend  the winter  grazing  
off the residual  grass after the ewes.  They are housed  in the lambing  shed in 
late March  for 3-4 weeks  where  we hope that they will pick up toxoplasmosis  
and gain immunity  before  they are tupped  in the following  autumn.  They also 
become  accustomed  to feeding  on silage  and to being housed.
We now favour  the Greyface  over the Mule because  they have a longer  
productive  life and are more capable  of carrying  multiples.  We find that both 
breed types are great milkers  and very capable  of finishing  twins quickly.
Sire breeds
The rams are Suffolk  and Charolais.  The Charolais  have been introduced  
as sires over the past two to three years and we are pleased  with them. How ­
ever, the Suffolk  is hard to beat as a sire breed;  the lambs  are vigorous  when 
born and they finish quickly  off a good milking  ewe.
We buy our rams at pedigree  Suffolk  sales with strong  bone,  good confor ­
mation,  a good neck and shoulder  being  essential  to compensate  for the rather  
poor shoulder  in some  of our ewes. Side by side with these  traits,  we also aim 
for rams with high LEAN  GROWTH  INDEX,  knowing  that ability  to produce  
lean meat quickly  will be passed  on to their progeny.
148
Management  calendar:  Ewes  pre-tupping
People  often complain  that there is a lot of work associated  with sheep.  
With a big flock we try to keep to a fairly rigid management  calendar.  In late 
August  the ewes are dagged  and body scored.  All their feet are examined  and 
trimmed  as required.  We use a turning  crate and we can get through  just over 
1000 ewes in 3'/2 days. Thin ewes are flushed  immediately  and all are dosed  
with cobalt. The rest of the ewes  are flushed  for three  weeks  pre-tupping.  Ewes  
and rams are winter  dipped  pre-tupping.
Ram  care
The rams are foot pared  and given  -booster  Hep-P  in late August.  They are 
fed a whole  barley/soya  mix for six weeks  pre-tupping.
Mating  management
The ewes  are managed  in flocks  of 200 with 6 rams  per flock.  Care is taken  
to have a good mix of rams,  e.g. 2 ram lambs,  2 hoggets  and 2 matures.  They  
are harnessed  and crayons  are changed  as per ewe mark up. We find about 10 
days for the first change  and the next change  following  within  7 days, giving  
us a peak of lambing  around  St. Patrick ’s Day. Last autumn  we split the ram 
turn-out;  rams were turned  out with 600 ewes and 7 days later the other 430 
ewes were  joined.  This resulted  in a lambing  peak  spread  over seven  days and 
not five days as in previous  years. It meant  that facilities  and staff were not 
always  stressed  to the limit.
When  the rams are with the ewes they are disturbed  as little as possible.
Post-mating
Rams  are removed  after  6-7 weeks,  checked  for condition,  feet etc., treated  
as necessary  and put on good  pasture  to recuperate.  The ewes are permitted  to 
hoover  around  the farm mopping  up any spare grass.
Housing  and winter  shearing
Ewes  are housed  in the first week  in January,  this year  on January  8th. They  
are shorn shortly  afterwards,  this year on January  10th.
Winter  shearing  is a great asset to us: (1) We can carry more ewes in the 
sheds;  (2) lamb birthweight  is increased  significantly;  (3) it facilitates  ease of 
suck and management  greatly.  One disadvantage  is large milky  elders  in some  
ewes  can become  chapped  and sore as there  is no fleece  to protect  them in cold 
sleaty  weather.  Good  field shepherding  is essential  to identify  these  ewes  before  
mastitis  and hungry  lambs  occur.  In general,  the advantages  of winter  shearing  
outweigh  the disadvantages.
Our sheds  are not purpose  built and are all converted  cattle  sheds. The ewes  
are penned  in groups  of 45-60  per pen. They  are body  scored  after  shearing  and 
thin ewes are penned  together  where  they will not be bullied.
Feeding  pre-lambing
After housing,  the ewes are offered silage only, fed with a Keenan  
diet feeder.  In mid February  meal feeding  is commenced  according  to mark  up, 
at the rate of 450g (1 lb) meal per head per day for six weeks  pre-lambing.
149
Meals  consist  of a home mix of oats, beet pulp and soya with minerals  
added.  Current  price is about £142.00  per tonne and we find that it is good  
value.  The meals  are fed mixed  through  silage.  It is an excellent  system;  it cuts 
down  on labour  and it is easier  on sheep  and shepherds  alike.  The ewes do tend 
to sort out the meals  but in general  all ewes appear  to get their quota.  The thin 
ewes that are segregated  are given extra meals  in troughs.
One disadvantage  is that when ewe numbers  are decreasing  in sheds,  it is 
difficult  to regulate  the meal/silage  ratio.  When  ewe numbers  are down  to 200 
to lamb, we use trough  feeding.
The whole  flock is given mid pregnancy  copper  and Fasinex  14 days after 
housing.  This is the only fluke treatment  given to the ewes.
At four  weeks  pre-lambing  according  to their  mark the  ewes are given  scour  
vaccine  - this year we used immocolibov.  At three weeks  pre-lambing  Hep-P  
and a worm dose of Nilverm  are administered.  This is the only worm dose 
given to the ewes for the year. At every vaccination  the ewes are footbathed  
and lame ewes are foot-pared.
At all times  ewe body condition  is assessed  and any ewes showing  signs  
of stress or loss in condition  are group  penned  separately  for extra feeding.
Lambing  season
Lambing  is our harvest.  It is all hands  on deck. We work a 24 hour watch 
with one shepherd  on at night and three people  on during  the day.
This year  I had no outside  labour  and we managed.  I find that a person  who 
knows  what  he/she  is doing  is better  than two people  who are not familiar  with 
the flock or with the set up.
We use a work rota where  every  one knows  their  job. I mainly  work with 
deliveries,  penning  and lamb health.  Another  shepherd  works  with nurseries  
and turn-out  to grass.  We have a field shepherd  for inspecting  the fields  after  
turn-out  of young  lambs.  Our policy  is ‘don’t send problems  to the fields,  keep  
them in until they are strong  enough’ .
This year we bought  extra hurdles  for individual  pens. We now have about  
two pens per 10 ewes;  this was a great help. There  is nothing  worse than  having  
six ewes  lambing  together  in a pen and nowhere  to put them.  We use straw  and 
disinfectant  liberally.
Management  post-lambing
Our system  is simple.  After  lambing,  the ewe is penned  and lambs ’ navels  
are dipped.  Lambs  are given  a suck and if there are milk problems,  other  ewes  
are robbed  or cows  colostrum  is used. Stomach  tubing  is frequently  carried  out 
especially  where  lambs  are slow to suck. They remain  penned  for 24 hours;  
they are marked  and ringed  and four hours  later are moved  to a nursery,  where  
10-12  ewes  are penned  with their Iambs.  On the following  day they are moved  
to the fields.
Lamb  adoptions  and cross  fostering
We carry  out a lot of adoptions,  mainly triplets  onto single lambs.  Inevitably  
some  adoptions  do break  down. Adoptions  are usually  conducted  at birth  when
150
the lambs  are wet; there  are usually  no problems.  We go to great  lengths  to fool  
the ewes and spend  time wetting  a lamb and getting  him bonded.  We find that 
it is time well spent.  We use fostering  crates  for adoptions  in the case of ewes  
that have lambed  for a quite  a while. After  two days the ewes are usually  quite  
happy  to accept  their new lambs.
Turn-out  is conducted  with ATV transport  and trailer  or let out crate  which  
carries  16 ewes and their lambs.  After  turn-out,  particular  watch  is maintained  
for mis-mothering.
Results
Ewes and lambs  are not fed at grass unless  the weather  is very bad. This 
year we used the ATV with a snacker  which  delivers  neat piles of nuts on the 
ground;  the ewes were very good at hoovering  up the nuts. But feeding  was 
confined  to a few very wet days. High Mag buckets  are liberally  dispersed  in 
the fields  to prevent  tetany  and appear  quite effective.  The silage  fields  are all 
grazed  intensively  until they are closed  in the first week of April.  The lambs  
are dosed  at 6 weeks  and given a copper  bolus.
Ewe lambing  results  for 1996 are summarised  in Table 1.

Drafting  lambs
The first sales commence  at about 11 weeks  and at weaning  we hope to 
have 45% of the lambs  sold. The pattern  of lamb weights  at weaning  in 1995 
is summarised  in Table 2.

Lambs  are drafted  every 10 days approximately  or if the factory  is anxious  
for a few! We use the scales  and body scoring.  In general,  we sell at around  
42 kg but fat lambs  would  be let off at lighter  weights.  At weaning,  we draft  
all lambs which  are fit because  kill-out  drops afterwards.
The weaned  lambs  are weight  graded,  worm  dosed  and given  cobalt.  Any 
piners  are also given multivitamins.
151
Management  post-weaning
Hock  health  is monitored  after  weaning  and lambs  are dosed  only when  we 
think  it is needed;  we do not dash out at the first sign of a dirty tail. This year 
we are using  Oramec,  next  year  Levamizole.  We do not use the white  drenches.
The ewes are culled  after weaning  when elders  are still in milk and any 
problems  can be identified.  Old and broken  mouthed  sheep  are culled  severely. 
This means  that our replacement  rate is high but we feel we are rewarded  by 
having  healthier,  more productive  sheep  in the flock.
The ewes are tightened  up and live mainly  on fresh air and exercise  until 
September!
Dipping  is carried  out as needed;  usually  two dippings  during  the fly season  
and then the winter  dip.
Results  on financial  performance  in 1995 are shown  in Tables  3 and 4.

Summary
To summarise,  we believe  that costs are an important  issue in flock  
profitability.  We aim to keep costs,  especially  labour,  to an absolute  minimum  
without  affecting  ewe productivity.
Of late, developments  and “buz” in the sheep  industry  have been lacking.  
There  have  been substantial  advances  in understanding  nutrition  in the ewe, in 
particular  for ewes  carrying  multiples,  and scanning  has proved  a great  help to 
many farmers.
For my own flock  I would  like to see an effective  vaccine  against  the plague  
of scour  and watery mouth. I am becoming  a bit fed up with  chemical  companies  
blaming failures  on sloppy  management.  Farmers  are no fools;  we are  prepared  
to progress,  we now diligently  vaccinate,  feed and care for our flocks.  We need  
innovation  from chemical  companies  and research  institutes  to motivate  us.

Carcass  Classification:  Results  and 
Prospects
J. P. HANRAHAN
Teagasc,  Belclare  Research  Centre,  Tuam, Co. Galway.
Introduction
The need for a defined  system  for describing  sheep carcasses  has been 
promoted  for a long time. Tbe principal  argument  for the introduction  of a 
standardised  classification  system  for carcasses  is that it would provide  the 
language  to enable  all interested  parties  - farmers,  exporters,  wholesalers,  
consumers  and support  agencies  - to communicate  about  the product,  without  
ambiguity.  This is an essential  facility  if producers  are to be enabled  to match 
their  product  to the requirements  of the market.  The absence  of a classification  
system  for the output  of the sheep  industry  has allowed  confusion  to reign in 
discussions  about  market  requirements,  production  objectives,  breed choices  
etc.
It should  be noted  that a carcass  classification  system  has been in operation  
in Britain  for the past 20 years and for an even longer  period  in France.  It is 
remarkable  that our industry  has been able to expand  and continue  to find markets 
without  having  a system  for describing  its product.  This is probably  fortuitous  
and due in the main to expanding  demand  in France  allied with shrinking  
domestic  production.  Clearly,  to continue  on such a laissez  faire course  would 
be a very high risk strategy,  given the ever increasing  consumer  reactivity  to 
issues related  to quality,  health and value for money  and the increasing  
competitiveness  of our export  markets.  The imminent  introduction of an agreed,  
standardised  national  classification  system  for lamb  carcasses  is very welcome  
and long overdue  - the regret  is that it has taken such a long time to arrive  at 
this threshold.
What  is classification?
It is appropriate  to remind  ourselves  what “classification  is” and what “it 
is not”.
Classification  is a system  which describes  the attributes  of individual  
carcasses.  The objective  is to give information  on those  attributes  which  are of 
economic  importance,  in terms which are easily understood  by producers,  
wholesalers  and retailers.  The list of attributes  needs  to be short,  otherwise  the 
purpose  will be defeated.  It is widely  agreed  that carcass  weight  together  with 
an assessment  of fat content  and conformation  provide  an adequate  and practical 
system  for describing  lamb carcasses  for the purposes  of the market.
Classification  is not a system for describing  the value  of individual  carcasses.  
Thus it is not correct  to expect  or demand  that specified  price differentials  be 
attached  to the various  classes  which  a system  of classification  yields.  It is up 
to market  forces  to determine  the value of carcasses  with any particular  
combination  of attributes  at any particular  time. Classification  provides  the
154
language  which  allows  the requirements  of the market  to be transmitted,  via 
price,  to the producer.
Carcass  weight  - presents  no difficulties  as it is an objective  attribute.
Carcass  fatness  - this is based  on the visual assessment  of the amount  of 
fat on the external  surface  of the carcass  in conjunction  with the amount  of 
kidney  plus channel  fat. This assessment  is subjective  but standardised  against  
objectively-determined  ranges  of subcutaneous  fat in carcasses.
Conformation  - this is also subjective  being a visual assessment  of the 
thickness  of the flesh (i.e. muscle  + fat) in relation  to the size of the skeleton.  
The various  conformation  classes  are based  on the blockiness  and convexity  
of the carcass  and the fullness  of the legs. No attempt  is made  to allow  for the 
influence  of degree  of fat cover  on overall  shape.
The EU Sheep  Management  Committee  regulation  on sheep carcass  
classification  provides  for a grid defined  by five conformation  classes  and five 
fat classes  - the EUROP  grid. However  precise  standards  were not specified  
to define  this grid. The terms  used to define  the different  classes  are to a large  
extent  indicative  and require  the development  of specific  standards  - such as 
those developed  by the Meat  and Livestock  Commission  - to enable  consistent  
application  in practice.  The precise  standard  specifications  which  have been 
developed  in countries  - such as Erance,  Britain  and Spain  - with established  
classification  systems  are not directly  comparable  although  all use the EUROP  
grid to describe  the results.  This means  that it is not possible  to directly  compare  
the classification  results  across  countries.  Such  comparisons  would  require  the 
use of exactly  the same classification  standards  in both countries  and regular  
inter-country  checks  to ensure  consistent  interpretation  of such standards.
These  issues  are raised  so that it is clearly  understood  that one cannot  compare  
classification  results  in the same way that one can compare  carcass  weights.  
Careful  and cautious  interpretation  is essential.  The same  reservations  apply  to 
classification  systems  which  have been operated  by individual  abattoirs.  The 
value of a nationally  standardised  system  is that, provided  there is on-going  
supervision and refresher  training,  classification  results  can be compared  among  
abattoirs.  It should  be understood  by all concerned  that, heretofore,  quotations  
based  on R3 carcasses  could not be compared  among  abattoirs  to any useful  
degree.

The classification  system which,  according  to media  reports, has been  agreed 
among  the interested  parties  is based  on a simplification  of the EUROP  grid 
and apparently  uses the standards  developed  by the MLC  in Britain  as the basis. 
The proposed  system  is overlaid  on the EUROP  grid in Figure  1. The following  
are the definitions  of the Irish system  in terms  of the EUROP  (MLC)  grid:
Class EUROP  (MLC)  grid elements
A E2 4- E3 + U2 + U3
B R2 + R3
C 02 + 03
X E4+E5-I-U4-HU5+R4+R5+04+05+P4-I-P5
Y El + U1 + R1 + 01 + PI 4- P2 -1- P3
The labels  A, B, C, X and Y are used here for convenience  of reference  
only. In practice  many of the cells on the 5 x 5 EUROP  grid will not contain  
any carcasses  or so few that they can be safely  ignored.  Thus,  our experience  
using  the MLC  system  in Irish export  abattoirs  shows  that the majority  of fat- 
class 1 carcasses  are conformation  P; a conformation  score of less than U is 
hardly  ever seen for fat class 5; less than R is very rare for fat class 4 while 
fat classes  2 upwards  almost  never  get a conformation  score of less than O. 
Hence,  in practical  terms we have the following  equivalence  between  the 
proposed  Irish grid and the EUROP  (MLC)  grid:
Class EUROP  (MLC)  grid elements Comment

B R2 4- R3 —
C 02 4- 03 Poor conformation
X E4 4- E5 4- U4 4- U5 4- R4 Overfat
Y PI 4- P2 Unfinished
At Belclare  we have been using the full MLC grid to classify  lambs  from 
research  flocks and from commercial  flocks since 1988. The same team of 
technical  staff  have  done  the classification  throughout  and they received  refresher  
training  each year at MLC training  centres  in Britain.
In the following  sections  of this paper  results  from  our studies  will be used 
to highlight  various  aspects  of carcass  classification. In all cases  the classification  
results  will be presented  in terms of the proposed  combined  grid as outlined  
above.
Classification  results
General.  We have  routinely  classified  carcasses  at various  export  abattoirs  
during  the main marketing  season  from May to November  in each year since  
1989. The pattern  of visits to abattoirs  was usually  dictated  by deliveries  of
156
lambs  from the various  flocks  attached  to the sheep research  programme  in 
Teagasc.  In addition  specific  visits were made  as part of an assessment  of the 
carcass  profile  for lambs  delivered  by various  producer  groups.  On all sucb 
visits our technicians  routinely  classified  carcasses  from other sources  which  
were being  processed  at the time. These  carcasses  will henceforth  be referred  
to as “commercial ”, to distinguish  them from those from Teagasc  flocks  and 
from producer  groups.  In all cases the information  recorded  included  a code  
which  identified  the carcasses  belonging  to an individual  supplier  (farmer  or 
dealer)  and carcass  weight  was also recorded.  When  the carcasses  were from  
hill lambs  this was also noted.
An indication  of the general  pattern  of the classification  results  is given  in 
Table 1, which  is based  on all carcasses  from commercial  sources  which  were  
classified  during  the years 1993 to 1995 inclusive.  During  these years there  
were occasions  when  of lambs  destined  for the “light-lamb ” trade were being  
processed.  Such  carcasses  and those  from  hill lambs  were not included  in Table  
1. The classification  standards  which  were used (defined  by MLC in Britain)  
included  subdivision  of fat classes  3 and 4 into L and H subclasses.  Inspection  
of Table 1 shows  a concentration  of carcasses  in the following  classes;
U3L, U3H, U4L, R3L, R3H, 02 and 03L.
It is also obvious  from the table  that there is an association  between  fatness  
and conformation  - as carcass  fat score  increases  so conformation  improves  (O 
to R, R to U). A final point  to be noted  is that most of the “overfat ” carcasses  
(i.e. 4 and 5) are in the U4L  class.  It can be argued,  on the basis  of the patterns  
in the table,  that by avoiding  the production  of overfat  carcasses  most  of these  
will be converted  into U3H  or R3H and thus will increase  the proportion  in the 
A/B group  of the combined  grid.

157
The same  results  expressed  in terms  of the combined  classification  system  
are also given  in Table 1. These  show that 28% of carcasses  were over fat and 
almost  17% had poor conformation.
A third feature  of the results  is that while  mean carcass  weight  for these  
years  was 18.9 kg the range was very  great  -14 to 35 kg. Indeed any examination  
of carcasses  at export  abattoirs  reveals  an extreme  variability  in carcass  weight.  
This is an undesirable  aspect  of the “quality ” profile,  but one which  is easily  
remedied.
Pattern  over years:  An indication  of the profile  of carcasses  for the years  
1990  to 1995 is given  in Figure  2 which  displays  the proportion  of A/B and of 
over-fat  (X) carcasses  for each year. There  has been no consistent  pattern  of

improvement  over  time although  the proportion  of class-C  carcasses  was lower  
in 1994 and 1995 than in any previous  year. This change  was, however,  
accompanied  by an increase  in overfat  carcasses  such that the proportion  of 
class A/B in 1994/95  was 52% compared  with about 53% for the 1990/  
91 period.

Producer  groups:  The results  for the classification  of carcasses  from  lambs  
supplied  by producer  groups  are summarised  in Tables  2 and 3 alongside  
carcasses  for corresponding  periods  for sources  other than producer  groups  
(commercial).  Clear  differences  are evident  for both periods  which,  it can be 
argued, are attributable  to the well defined  marketing  objectives  which  motivate  
the members  of such groups.  Producer  groups  delivered  a greater  proportion  
of A/B carcasses  and a smaller  proportion  of overfat  carcasses  in both periods  
covered  by the data in these tables.  These  differential  results  also support  the 
argument,  advanced  later in this paper, that producers  can transform  the 
classification  profile  of lamb  by the implementation  of specified  strategies  when 
selecting  lambs  for slaughter.  These  results strongly support  the idea  that farmers  
can substantially  alter the profile  of the carcasses  produced  by adhering  to well 
defined  objectives in relation  to the drafting  of lambs  for slaughter.  This argument  
is further  supported  by the results  on the classification  of lambs  from  two research  
flocks  over  the period  1988  to 1994.  The flocks in question consisted  of a variety  
of crossbred-  and Belclare-type  ewes and each year these ewes were joined  
with 16 to 20 individual  rams representing  as many  as 8 different  breeds.  The
159
classification  profile  yielded  by over 4000  carcasses  involved  was as follows:
A............................. 20.8%
B .............................41.4%
C.............................. 10.3%
X.............................27.2%
Y............................. 0.3%
The average  carcass  weight  was 18.1 kg. The proportion  of A/B was as high 
as that achieved  by producer  groups  in most years,  the proportion  of class C 
was generally  lower  than for producer  groups  while  the proportion  of overfat  
carcasses  was generally  higher  than for the producer  groups.  Sixty percent  of 
the carcasses  in the overfat  class were in fact U4L and by the imposition  of 
more rigorous  fatness  standards  at drafting  these would  be converted  to either  
U3H or R3Jf classes  and thus one could project  that the proportion  of A/B 
would  be increased  to over  75% with  only a  marginal increase  in the percentage  
of class-C  carcasses.
Weight  characteristics  of  carcasses  from  different  sources:  A striking  aspect  
of carcasses  from commercial  sources  is the variability  in carcass  weight.  The 
difference  between  such carcasses  and those from producer-group  lambs  is 
summarised  in Table  4. This table  displays  the weight  range  which  encompasses  
90% of all carcasses  from each source  for the years 1990,1993  and 1994.  There  
was at least a 2 kg difference  between  the two sources  in the weight  range  
required  to include  90% of all carcasses.  More  detailed  analyses  have shown  
that this is not a reflection  of greater  differences  among  individual  suppliers  of 
lambs.  The difference  in variability  was just as great  when  the variation  among  
lambs  from  an individual  owner  on a given  day was examined.  Carcasses  from 
individual members  of a producer  group  displayed  less than 50%  of the variability 
evident  among  carcasses  from individual suppliers  who were not producer  group 
members.
This difference  in weight  variation  can account  for a large  proportion  of the 
difference  between  these sources  in the proportion  of carcasses  in the A/B 
category.

1995 — 12.6 to 23.8 = 7.8 kg
Seasonal  variation:  The association  between  the classification  profile  and 
time of the year was examined  using classification  results  for one producer  
group  whose  lambs  were monitored  weekly  from May to November  in each of

two seasons.  The results  for one year are shown  in Figure  3. These  show some  
seasonal  decline  in the proportion  of A/B carcasses  - from near 80% in May-  
June to about  70% through  July to September  with a further  decline  to around  
60% in October/November.  There  was little change  in the proportion  in class  
C but a noticeable  shift upwards  in the proportion  of overfat  carcasses.  This 
trend was accompanied  by an upward shift in average  carcass  weight  from about  
18.9 kg in May/June  to 19.3 in October/November.
This  pattern  of change  suggests  that a substantial  part of the seasonal  change  
could be attributed  to associated  changes  in the weight  at which  lambs  were  
marketed  rather  than any major  inherent  seasonal  shift in the intrinsic  quality  
profile  attainable.
Carcass  weight:  The weight  of a carcass  has a very strong  influence  on the 
likely  classification.  This is illustrated  in Table  5 for both EUROP  grid and tor 
the proposed  combined  classification  system.  These  results  illustrate  that poor  
conformation  carcasses  are generally  quite  light (average  about 16.5 kg) while  
overfat  carcasses  are at the other  end of the weight  range. There  will, of course,  
be considerable  overlaps  such that not all 16.5 kg carcasses  will be in the ‘O’ 
conformation  category  and carcasses  weighing  >21 kg are not automatically

overfat.  The results  also indicate  that for the A/B sector  of the classification  
grid the carcass  weight  should  be around  18.5 kg (Fig. 4).
The likely  response  of producers  to price  differentials  among  the different  
carcass  classes  will be, at least  in part, determined  by how any such differential  
affects  overall  value  per carcass. For  example,  the average  overfat  carcass  (Table  
5) weighs  about 12% (2 kg) more than the average  carcass  in the A/B group. 
Since  the nominal  direct  costs  of the extra  liveweight  to produce  this additional  
carcass  weight  are quite  small  relative  to the carcass  value  (and the opportunity  
cost is probably  close  to zero)  the producer  is unlikely  to respond  dramatically  
to price differentials  of less than 10 percent.  This is because  an A/B carcass  
weighing  18.8 kg, and attracting  a premium  of 10% per kg relative  to a carcass  
in class X, is in fact worth marginally  less;
1.1 X 18.8 = 20.68 < 21.0

The magnitude  of the response  by producers  to any price differentials  
forthcoming  from  the market  will certainly  be determined  by the magnitude  of 
such differentials  in conjunction  with overall  impact  on returns  per carcass.
Animal  factors  and Classification
The main issues which  arise  in relation to intrinsic  animal factors  influencing  
classification  results  are probably  breed, sex and rearing  type, i.e. single  or 
multiple.
Breed  effects:  The impact  of breeds  on classification  results  is an issue  
which  is generally  to the fore in discussions  about  carcass  “quality ” and is also 
an issue  on which  there  is no shortage  of conviction.  This is all rather  surprising  
given  the absence  of any consistent  system  for carcass  classification  - a point  
upon which  the “convicted ” should  carefully  reflect.  The broad  evidence  from  
our studies  of breed effects  on carcass  classification  shows  that while breed  
differences  do exist they are not overwhelming.  The most straightforward  
comparisons  which we have arise from an evaluation  of breeds  as terminal  
sires, where  all breeds  of sire are used across  a range of ewe breeds.  These  
results  are illustrated  in Table  6 and indicate  that, for example,  all of the more  
recently  introduced  French  breeds  as a group,  are somewhat  poorer  (in terms  
of percentages  of A/B and C) than the long established  terminal  sires (Suffolk  
and Texel).  Thus  the average  percentage  A/B for the set “Charollais,  Vendeen,  
Bleu,  Rouge ” was 62 compared  with 68 for Suffolk  and Texel  combined  while  
the corresponding  percentages  for class  C were averaged  12 and 7, respectively.  
Given  these  results  one must wonder  about  the basis for the factory  quotations  
which  offer a premium  for continental-cross  lambs.
The other general  point with regard  to breed is that our results  show that 
lambs  from Scottish  Blackface  or Scottish-Blackface-cross  ewes will yield  fewer  
carcasses  in the A/B classes  and somewhat  more  in class  C. However  any such

shifts  in carcass  classification  must not be judged  in isolation  but rather  must  
be considered  in the overall  complex  of factors  influencing  profitability  of the 
sheep  enterprise.
Sex effects:  The principal  way in which  sex influences  classification  results  
is through  fatness  at a given  carcass  weight.  Female  lambs  achieve  the same  
degree  of fatness  (and conformation)  at a carcass  weight  which  is about  0.5 to 
0.6 kg less than male  castrates  reared  under  exactly  the same  conditions.  Thus,  
in selecting  female  lambs  for slaughter,  it should  be remembered  that they will 
be finished  at a liveweight  of 1 to 1.5 kg less than their male  counterparts.  The 
differences  between  entire males  and wethers  is of much smaller  magnitude  
and can usually  be ignored  although  the kill-out  percentage  will be lower  for 
the entire  males  (by about 1 percentage  point).
Rearing  type effects:  Lambs  reared  as singles  grow much more rapidly  
than those reared  as twins and are usually  ready for slaughter  3 to 4 weeks 
earlier.  The differences  between  single  and twin lambs  with respect  to carcass  
classification  are shown  in Table  7, based  on lambs  from Teagasc  flocks.  The 
most obvious  fact in this table is that singles  are more likely to be overfat  - 
probably  a reflection  of delaying  drafting  until after weaning  in our research  
flocks so that all lambs have complete  liveweight  records  to weaning  at 14 
weeks  of age. However  there is also a difference  in average  carcass  weight  in 
favour  of singles  and this is not explained  by the higher  proportion  of overfat  
lambs.  In fact more detailed  analyses  of these data show that singles  are still 
about 0.7 kg heavier  than twins when both are in the A/B class. Thus twin-  
reared  lambs  are “finished ” at a lighter  weight.  This is probably  explicable  in 
terms  of the differences  in dietary  composition  between  single  and twins  - grass 
constitutes  a significant  proportion  of the diet of a twin from a much  earlier  age 
than for a single  and as a result  the diet of twins is probably  less optimal  for 
synthesis  of body protein,  with the result that a greater  proportion  of energy 
intake  is deposited  as fat. There is no evidence  in the results  to suggest  that 
twins yield carcasses  with poorer  conformation  than singles.
164
Consistency  of Classification
While  it is not possible  to go into this question in any detail  here  the reliability  
of any classification  system  is undoubtedly  of interest  to producers.  Consider  
the situation  in which the  classifier  makes  one error  in every  50 carcasses.  This,  
it can be argued,  is a very low error  rate for a subjective  system.  Such an error  
rate would  mean  that where  a producer  has 20 carcasses  classified  then all 20 
will be classified  correctly  with a probability  of 0.67. On the other  hand,  if the 
error  rate is 1 in 10 carcasses  then the probability  that 20 carcasses  will be all 
classified  correctly  is 0.1. My analysis  of such  error  patterns  indicates  that given  
a supervisory  system  which  involves  the checking  of a set of 20 carcasses  then 
there will be little difficulty  in detecting  error rates of 1 in 10. Error  rates of 
1 in 20 will be more difficult  to detect  and would  require  the checking  of at 
least three  sets of 20 carcasses.  It would  seem  reasonable  to argue  that an error  
rate of less than 1 in 10 should  be tolerable  since the errors  can be either  for 
or against  the producer  with equal likelihood.
On a number  of occasions  during  the past few seasons  we have compared  
our classification  results  with those  produced  by abattoirs.  The results  of one 
such exercise  are given in Table 8 for illustrative  purposes.  It must be 
emphasised  that these exercises  were undertaken  prior  to any agreed  
standard  classification  system.  The results  do, however,  emphasise  the 
s'^jSctive  basis  of all classification  systems  and that the labels  put on individual  
classes  have  no absolute,  objective  meaning.  The results  also  underline  the vital 
importance  of an industry-wide  system with  continuous  monitoring  of standards  
to ensure  consistency.  The numbers  illustrated  in Table  8 show  that the factory  
classifier  used a much  narrower  range  of classes  and consistently  under  scored  
fatness  relative  to the Teagasc classifiers  and also assigned  lower  conformation  
scores.  This was a consistent  feature  of all such exercises  which we have  
undertaken.  It must be pointed  out that I am not saying  that our results  are 
“more correct ”. From a producers  viewpoint  these experiences  suggest  that 
factory  classifiers  are lenient  towards  what we would  call “over fatness ”.

Future  prospects  - Producing  to a specification
Individual  producers  can readily  increase  the proportion  of carcasses  which  
fall within  specified  cells of the classification  grid. Comparisons  given  above  
between  producers  groups  and other  suppliers  illustrate  the shift  in classification  
profile  which  can be effected  by setting  defined  production  goals and 
implementing  drafting  procedures  designed  to attain the goals specified.  The 
two main  elements  which  are of relevance  are carcass  weight  and fatness.  Thus,  
under  present  marketing  conditions  for the majority  of our main season  lamb  
there  is a specified  carcass  weight  range  with some  penalties  for overfat  carcasses. 
To attain this specification  the first requirement  is to draft lambs  so that they 
yield carcasses  within  the specified  weight  range. Based  on analyses  of 
information  on liveweight  and carcass  weight  the following  rule holds.
To get 90% of carcasses  within  a specific  weight  range  the lambs  must  
be drafted  within  a liveweight  range  which  is not more  than  one third  greater  
than the specified  carcass-weight  range,  i.e. liveweight  range  should  equal  
1.33 *(carcass  weight  range).
Thus,  if the specified  weight  range  for carcasses  is 3.5 kg then lambs  must  
be drafted  within  a 4.5 kg liveweight  range.  The required  precision  of drafting  
can only be achieved  by weighing  lambs  at the point of drafting.
While  the foregoing  rule specifies  the liveweight  range  it does not give the 
minimum  and maximum  values  needed  in practice.  This can  only be done  with 
some knowledge  of the kill-out  percentage.  This varies with the production  
system,  e.g. early lamb will usually  have higher  kill-out  rates, due to the fact 
that they will be on dams  milk plus concentrates,  than main-season  lamb),  time 
of year, diet, sex, breed,  etc. However  as a general  rule one can adopt the 
following  conventions;
Unweaned  lambs 48%
Weaned  lambs  on grass
(early summer) 45%
Weaned  lambs  on grass
(late summer/autumn) 43%
Now for a target  carcass  weight  range  with an upper  limit of 20 kg and a 
lower  limit of 16.5 the target  liveweight  is 18.25/0.44  = 40.5 kg. The range  in 
liveweight  should  not exceed  4.5 kg. The upper  limit should  be 43kg and the 
lower  limit 38.5 kg. Similar  calculation  can be made  for other  combinations  of 
carcass  weight  and kill-out  proportion.
Note that the liveweight  range should  not be calculated  by dividing  the 
upper  and lower  limits  of carcass  weight  by the kill-out  proportion.  This will 
yield a range  which  is far too wide (8 kg for the present  example)  resulting  in 
a correspondingly  wide carcass  weight  range (6kg).
That  the simple  exercise  of restricting  carcass  weight  within specified limits  
will significantly  alter the classification  profile  as illustrated  in Table 9. The 
proportion  of A/B is increased  from 55% to 66%  with corresponding  reduction  
in the overfat  and poor-conformation  classes.

C 16.9 11.4
X 27.7 22.4
Y 0.0 0.0
In practice,  drafting  should  be done using the specified  liveweight  rules  
together  with  an assessment  of fatness.  Degree  of fatness  can be assessed  through  
palpation  over the rib cage, at the tail root and over the loin. It is not possible  
to “write down ” how to assess  fatness  - this must be learned  through  hands-  
on experience.  With  regular  practice  related  to results  from  the abattoir,  producers  
should  be able to avoid  producing  lambs  which  are over-fat  or under-finished.
Based  on results  from  producer  groups  and flocks  and with a clear  objective  
of avoiding  the production  of carcasses  in the 4L fat category  it should  be quite  
feasible  to achieve  a target  of between  75 and 80% of carcasses  in the A/B 
sector  of the combined  classification  grid.
This target  can be achieved  without  any recourse  to breed  changes.  In fact 
I would  argue  that focusing  on the issues such  as “which  breed? ” is an avoidance  
of the question  of how to effect  an immediate  and dramatic  improvement  in the 
quality  profile.  However,  such improvement  requires  that individual  producers  
take responsibility  for the type of lambs  they draft for slaughter.  Abattoirs  can 
assist  in this process  by implementing  the proposed  classification  system  and 
by reflecting  market  preferences  in their quotations  of price with reference  to 
the classification  grid. It is, I would  suggest,  counter  productive  to offer  premiums  
for any breed  type. Rather  carcasses  should  be paid for on their merits  relative  
to market  demand.  Past  experiences  can readily  be adduced  to support  the notion 
that producers  will  quickly  respond  to unambiguous  and consistent  signals  from  
the market  - a process  which  can only operate  through  the medium  of carcass  
classification.

Introduction
The main purpose  of this study  is to examine  and compare  sheep  production  
in France,  the UK and Ireland.  Ireland  and the UK were selected  as being  the 
main EU exporting  countries,  whilst  France  is the main EU importing  country  
and is also a major  sheep  producer.
Sheep  production  was investigated  under  the following  main headings:
1. A review  of sheep  production  within  the EU.
2. Size and structure  of sheep  production  in France,  the UK and Ireland  were  
examined  at in terms  of sheep  numbers,  flock size, and meat production.
3. Lamb prices,  seasonality  of production  and carcase  weights  were  
investigated.
4.
5.Technical  performance  of sheep  farming  in France,  the UK and Ireland,  
was examined.  Stocking  rate, weaning  percentage,  mortality  rate, carcase  
weight  produced  per hectare  are all reported  here.  Performance  comparisons  
are confined  to lowland  flocks,  as it was difficult  to compare  mountain  
sheep  production  in the three countries.
Financial  performance  of the sheep enterprise  in the three countries  are 
compared.  Again  the data  relate  to lowland  flocks  to make  the comparisons  
meaningful.  Output,  cost, gross  margin  and net margin  data are presented  
for the three countries.
Sheep  production  in the E.U.
Sheep  meat  accounts  for only  4% or 1.2 m tonnes  of total meat  production  
within  the EU. Pigmeat  production,  at 15 m tonnes  is the highest,  followed  by 
beef  (7.2 m tonnes)  and poultry  meat  (7m tonnes)  in 1994.  Sheep  meat  production 
has also declined  over the last 5 years  - from 1.2 million  tonnes  in 1991 to an 
estimated  1.1 million  tonnes  in 1995.  Table  1 shows  production  by EU member  
state from 1980 to 1995.
The UK is by far the largest  producer  accounting  for 0.4 m tonnes  or one 
third  of total EU production  in 1994.  Spain  contributed  20%,  France  13%,  Greece  
11 % and Ireland  8% in the same  year. These  five countries  accounted  for 86% 
of total EU production  in 1995. Since 1980 production  increased  dramatically  
in both  Ireland and the UK but remained virtually static  in all other  EU countries,  
except  France  where  it declined  by over  30,000  tonnes.  Table  2 shows  the change  
in ewe numbers  throughout  the EU from 1980 to 1995.

The UK has the largest  ewe flock,  20 million  ewes, in 1995, an increase  
of almost  7 million  since 1980. Spain  had 17.4 and Greece  6.7m in 1995. The
169
balance  between  production  and consumption  of sheepmeat  in each member  
state is shown  in Table  3 for 1995.

Belgium,  France,  Germany  and Italy consume  much  more  sheep  meat  than 
they produce,  but the amounts  involved  are much greater  in France  i.e. 164,000 
tonnes  in 1995 versus  44,000  tonnes  for Germany,  48,000  for Italy and 18,000  
tonnes  for Belgium.  The UK is the largest  consumer  and, on the basis of the 
data in Table 3, appears  to be in equilibrium  in relation  to production  and 
consumption.  However, the UK exported approximately  140,000  tonnes in 1995 
to other  EU countries,  and imported  132,000  tonnes  in the same year. Ireland  
produced  three times more lamb than it consumed  in 1995. Consumption  is 
mainly  confined  to Greece,  Ireland,  France,  the UK, Spain  and Portugal,  as per 
capita  consumption  is only 1 to 2 kgs in the other countries.  Consumption  in 
the UK has declined  rapidly  since 1990 by 74,000  tonnes  (almost  17%) in 5 
years.  Table  4 shows  the overall  level of self sufficiency  within  the EU in sheep  
meat for selected  years from 1981 to 1995.

Source:  EUROSTAT
Self sufficiency  has increased  slowly  over the 14 years - from 79.5%  in 
1981 to 83.4 in 1995.  Sheep  meat  therefore  is unusual  in relation  to other  meats
170
within  the EU in that it is in deficit.  However,  the shortfall  is supplied  by third  
countries,  most  notably New  Zealand. The deficit  of 16.6%  in 1995  represented  
almost  200,000  tonnes  of sheep  meat.
Structure  of sheep  sector
The output  from sheep  in France  in 1995 was £IR 430 m, which  represents  
1.25%  of gross  agricultural  output.  This amount  does not include  direct  grants  
and premia  paid  to the sheep  sector,  which  if included  would  Increase  the sheep  
contribution  to gross  agricultural  output  to 1.6%.  Sheep contributed  7.6 and 5.0 
per cent to gross  agricultural  output  in the UK and Ireland  respectively  in 1995,  
excluding  direct  grants  and premia.

Number  of sheep producers 63,963 92,398 49,451

Sheep  production  is therefore  not a main contributor  to agriculture  in any 
of the 3 countries.  Nevertheless  there  were  61,400  farms  with at least 10 ewes
in France  in 1994, 92,398  in the UK and 49,451 in Ireland  inthe same year.
Total sheep  numbers  and ewe numbers  are shown  for the three countries
in Table 6 in 1995 based  on ewe premium  applicants.

The UK is by far the largest  sheep  producer  with average  flock size of 223 
ewes in 1995, which  was double  that of Ireland  or France.  In the UK, 24% of 
ewes  were in flocks  of over 1000  compared  to 1.6% in France  and 1 % in Ireland.
Sheep  production  has become  concentrated  within  the disadvantaged  areas  
in all three  countries,  as is shown  in Table  7, and even more  so in France  where  
85% of the breeding  flock is within  the disadvantaged  areas and this trend is 
continuing.

and UK prices  have  been  converted  to Irish  punts using annual market  exchange  
rates.

The prices  shown are as reported  to the EU for calculating  the ewe premium.  
Sheep  prices  in all three  countries  have  remained  virtually  static  in current  terms, 
implying  a considerable  decline  in real terms  over the period  shown.  Average 
French  prices  were  consistently  higher  than Irish prices  over the period,  1985-  
1994, with differences  ranging  from 22% in 1985 to 38% in 1992. French  
producers  received  from 51 pence  to 68 pence  more  per kg for their lamb than 
their  Irish  counterparts.  The UK price  was lower  than the Irish price  up to 1991 
but moved  ahead  of the Irish price from 1992 onwards  following  the removal  
of the variable  premium.  The Irish lamb price therefore,  is deteriorating  viz a 
viz France  and the UK in recent  years.  Table  9 shows  the relative  difference  
in price between  the 3 countries  over the 1985-1995  period.

The data shows  that both French  and UK lamb disposals  are more evenly  
distributed  throughout  the year than Irish disposals.  The French  have a slight  
tendency  to produce  more  in the earlier  part of the year  to avail  of higher  prices  
and a higher  percentage  of French  lambs  are finished  indoors  on all year  round  
basis. Ireland  on the other hand produces  almost  60% in the mid-season  i.e. 
April  to October,  with only  13%in  the first quarter.  On a monthly  basis,  Ireland  
and indeed  the UK’s main  disposals  occur  from May to November  and this has 
major  repercussions  for the price of lamb.
Average  carcase  weights  for lamb in France  the UK and Ireland  are shown  
in Table 11.
Table 11

Ireland 18.8 18.2 18.9 18.3 18.6 18.6
French  and UK carcase  weights  have remained  virtually  constant  over the 
period  and are almost  identical.  Irish carcases  on the other  hand have been on 
average  1.1 kg heavier  than the French  and UK carcases.  Irish carcase  weights  
shown  are based on results  of a Teagasc  survey  of lamb carcases  at various  
export  abattoirs  on a range of dates during  the main slaughtering  period.
Sheep  marketing  co-operatives  are extremely  important  in France  with 50% 
of carcase  sales going  through  producer  groups  and 32% of the live lamb  trade  
marketed  through  groups.  This is in marked  contrast  to the Irish  and UK situation,  
where  only a fraction  of lambs  are sold through  groups.  Theoretically  all lamb  
carcases  are graded  in France  on the EUROP  classification  grid. However,  in 
practice  only approximately  50% of carcases  are actually  classified  and paid
173
for on that basis.  All sales through  French  producer  groups  are on the basis of 
classification.
In the UK, 5.3 million  lamb  carcases  were  classified  in 1994  on the EUROP  
grid. This  represented  31 % of all slaughterings.  The  MLC monitor, on an annual 
basis, the percentage  of UK lambs  in the “targef ’ classification  sector  (EUR 
and 123L),  and 49.1%  of all lambs  were in this sector  in 1994.  The percentage  
in the “target ” sector  has increased  from 42% in 1990 to almost  49% in 1994.  
Ireland,  unlike  the other two countries,  does not have a national  carcase  
classification  scheme,  despite  much  discussion  and many attempts  to put one 
in place.  An agreed  carcase  classification  scheme  would  be crucial  in providing  
information  to produce  a quality  product,  as is demonstrated  by the schemes  
in France  and the UK.
Financial  performance
In this section  financial  returns  of sheep  production  are presented  for the 
3 countries.  In inter-country  comparisons,  it is important  to use data which 
represents  the average  commercial  situation  in each country.  Individual  farm 
data or results  from sheep  research  units,  whilst  useful  in demonstrating  levels 
of performance  and efficiency  that can be achieved,  do not represent  the average  
national  situation,  and consequently  should  not be used for this purpose.  The 
performance  of the Irish  sheep  sector  is based on the results  of a random  sample  
of sheep  producers  from  the 1994  National Farm  Survey.  Individual  flock  results 
are weighted  by flock size to provide  national  data on performance.  The UK 
data are based  on a national  survey  of sheep  producers  carried  out by Exeter  
University  in 1994. The UK data are also weighted  by flock size to provide  
national  results  for the sheep  sector.  Unfortunately,  there are no similar  national 
data available  for French  sheep  production.  Following  discussions  with INRA  
(National  Agricultural  Research  Agency),  and with the French  Agricultural  
Advisory  Service,  two regions  were  selected  to represent  lowland French  sheep  
production,  viz - the Limousin  and Poitou  - Charentes  Regions.  These  are the 
2 largest  lowland  sheep  producing  regions  in France  and account  for 20 per 
cent of all ewes in France.  An annual  survey  on financial  and technical  
performance  of commercial  sheep production  is carried  out by the regional  
advisory  service.  These  data were  taken  to represent  the French  sheep  situation  
and 1994 results  were used.
Table 12 shows  the financial  performance  of sheep  production  in the UK, 
Ireland  and both French  regions.  To facilitate  direct  comparison  French  and 
UK currencies  have  been  converted  to Irish  punts  using  average  annual  exchange  
rates.
On a per ewe basis, the French obtained  the highest  output  and gross  margin  
followed  by the Irish with the UK flocks  having  the lowest  returns.  Ireland  had 
the lowest  direct  costs  of production  on a per ewe and per hectare  basis  in 1994,  
and survey  data for each country  from 1988 to 1994 show that Ireland  had 
consistently  lower  direct  costs over this period.  On a per hectare  basis the UK 
achieved  highest  output  and gross margin,  due as will be shown  later to their 
higher  stocking  rate.

Direct  costs,  whilst  they are an important  component  in calculating  relative  
profitability,  do not illustrate  the complete  picture.  Overhead  costs are also 
critical,  as when  deducted  from gross  margin  they show the  real net profit  arising  
from sheep  production  and available  to meet farmer ’s living expenses.
Overhead  costs vary in each country,  as is shown  in Table  12, so their  effect  
on comparative  efficiency  of lamb  production  must  therefore  be examined.  The 
overhead  costs shown in Table 12 are actual costs attributable  to the sheep  
enterprise,  which  must be allowed  for by the farmer  and include  hired labour, 
interest  on borrowings,  insurance,  farm  and building  maintenance,  building  and 
machinery  depreciation  and others.  These  costs were collected  in all three  
countries  and are shown  in Table 12. Overhead  costs per ewe were highest  in 
France  due to higher  building  and machinery  depreciation  as well as higher  
interest  and labour  costs. Overhead  costs per hectare  were highest  in the UK 
due mainly  to paid labour,  land rent and depreciation.  The impact  of overhead  
costs  is shown  in Table 12, where Ireland  is seen to have the highest  net margin  
per ewe and per hectare.

direct  and overhead  costs per kg carcase,  Ireland  on the other hand had the 
lowest  direct  and overhead  costs  per kg carcase  at IR £0.89 and IR £ 1 respectively 
compared  to IR £0.98  and IR £2.18  for the UK. Direct  costs of producing  a kg 
of lamb in Ireland  were therefore,  9 pence  less than in the UK and 70 pence  
less than in France.  Ireland  had an additional  20 pence  per kg carcase  advantage  
on the UK in relation  to overhead  costs.  Net profit  per kg is highest  in Ireland,  
with UK producers  receiving  the lowest  net returns.  Total cost of producing  a 
kg of lamb is therefore,  highest  in France  at IR £3.66,  followed  by the UK at 
£2.18 with Ireland  lowest  at IR £1.89.
The Meat and Livestock  Commission  (MLC)  in the UK also collect  data 
on a select  group  of sheep  farms,  who pay for this service.  These  farms  have 
above  average  performance,  but it is interesting  to note  that even on those  farms  
direct  costs per kg lamb carcase  produced  are higher  than on Irish farms  with 
average  level of performance.

found  in the last Exeter  national  sheep  study in 1988, while  stocking  rate has 
increased  from 11 to 13.2 ewes per hectare.  The average  UK weaning  rate of 
138 lambs  per 100 ewes mated,  in 1994, whilst  higher  than that in Ireland,  is

Summary  and conclusions
Sheep  numbers  and meat  production  peaked  in EU in 1992,  and have  declined  
since then. The UK is the largest  producer  in the EU accounting  for 33% of 
sheep meat in 1994, with France  and Ireland  accounting  for 13% and 8% 
respectively. Average  flock  size in the UK was 223 in 1995,  which  was double  
that of Ireland  or France.  Over  75% of all ewes in the 3 countries  are located  
within  the disadvantaged  areas.
French  producers  obtained  the highest  prices,  with little  difference  between  
the UK and Irish prices  since 1992.  Prices  in current  terms  have  remained  static  
in the 3 countries  since 1985.  French  lamb  disposals  were  more  evenly  distributed  
through  out the year than disposals  in Ireland  and to a lesser  extent  in the UK. 
Carcase weights were  virtually  identical  in France and the UK with Irish  carcases  
1.1 kg heavier.
Gross  margin  per ewe was highest  in France,  followed  by Ireland  while  the 
UK had the lowest  margin.  Gross  margin  per hectare  was highest  in the UK 
due to high stocking  rate. Per ewe and per hectare  direct  costs were lowest  in 
Ireland,  with the French  having  the highest  direct  costs per ewe and the UK 
the highest  costs per hectare.  Ireland  had the lowest  overhead  costs and the 
highest  net margin  per ewe and per hectare.  Total  costs  of producing  a kg lamb  
carcase  was IR £ 1.89 in Ireland,  IR £2.18 in the UK and IR £3.66  in France.
Weaning  percentage  was similar  at 124 and 122 for France  and Ireland  
respectively,  while  the figure for the UK was 138 per 100 ewes  joined.  Stocking  
rate in the UK at 13.2 ewes per hectare  was higher  than France  at 7.8 and 
Ireland  at 9 ewes per hectare.
In 1994, Irish sheep  farmers  produced  a kg of lamb at 86 per cent of the 
UK cost and at 52 per cent of the French  cost and this competitive  advantage  
can be increased  with improvement  in technical  efficiency  of Irish flocks.
Marketing  Irish Lamb
PATRICK  J. MOORE  
An Bord Bia, Dublin.
The sheepmeat  industry  in Ireland,  and across  the EU, has undergone  major  
structural  changes  over the past decade.  Significant  shifts in markets,  a move 
from  red meats  to white meats, the  new EU sheepmeat  policy,  and GATT  reforms  
have all contributed  to these changes.
In Ireland,  the industry,  which  expanded  almost  threefold  since 1980, has 
recently  begun  to decline  and is facing  a tough  battle  on a number  of overseas  
markets,  especially  in France.
Meanwhile  exports  from the UK, Ireland ’s main competitor  on overseas  
markets,  are growing  and the sterling/punt  gap adds to their competitiveness.  
Imports  of fresh chilled  products  from New Zealand  add further  to the 
competition  facing  Irish exports  and act to moderate  prices,  especially  in the 
early season.
Market  requirements  are moving  to lighter  and leaner  lambs,  reflecting  a 
trend  to smaller  households and to more  health  conscious  consumers.  In Northern 
Europe  carcases  of around  18 kg ± 1 kg are preferred, while  in southern locations  
the preference  is for lighter  carcases  in the range  9-16  kg. All markets are looking  
for lean product.
For the Irish industry,  the combined  effect  of these trends  is that changes  
are needed  to improve  competitiveness,  enhance  product  quality  and to re­
position  our product  in export  markets.  Future  development  must  be guided  by 
market  requirements,  and must operate  within  a competitive  cost framework.  
Most  of the changes  proposed  in the Bord Bia Sheepmeat  Study  are within  the 
control  of the industry.
These  sets of changes  are recommended:
1. Changes  to maximise  production  efficiency  of the Irish flock through  
actions:
• to reduce  production  costs
• to increase  lambing  rates
• to improve  breeding  practices  and
• to improve  lamb selection,
2. Changes  to improve  carcase  quality  and to increase  value added  sales 
through:
• the introduction  of grading  / classification  scheme  that offers  
appropriate  price differentials.
• further  moves  into the preparation  and sale of meat cuts rather  
than carcases
178
3. Changes  to increase  market  returns  through;
• Target  spring  lamb  sales before  the seasonal  price  fall commences  in 
May
• Extend  production  season  for top quality  lamb
• Build market  for value added  products
Lamb  Quality  / Classiflcation
A national  lamb carcase  classification  scheme  has been launched  by the 
Department  of Agriculture,  Food and Forestry.  This is based on the EUROP  
system  and results  in five grades  representing  the full grid being  implemented.
A number  of plants  have  now organised to  have  computer  print  outs showing  
grades  and carcase  numbers  on all lambs. Prices  are being quoted  to most  
producer  groups  on the basis of the classification  scale.
Market  prospects  for Iamb
Export  sheep throughput  to late April increased  by 27 per cent over last 
year. This arose from increased  hogget  sales with no hold up like Spring  ’95 
and early lamb producers  responding  to the high prices  for Spring  lamb by 
moving  at lighter  weights.
Prices  for both hogget  and Spring  lamb have been the highest  on record,  
in part as a result  of the BSE  media  crisis  in beef  This created  an extra  demand  
for lamb,  especially in the UK, and thus less British  lamb was exported  to France.
The outlook  for the remainder  of the year looks encouraging.  EU sheep  
supplies will be lower  this year  following  a four  per cent fall in EU ewe numbers  
in the December  ’95 census.
An Bord  Bia activities  in support  of Irish Iamb
An Bord Bia has a comprehensive  range  of supports  to the Irish  lamb sector. 
The principal  elements  of this are as follows:
• Support  to Export  Processing  sector  under  the Structural  funds
• Lamb  promotions  on Home  and overseas  markets
• Market  information  provided  through  the weekly  ‘Market  Monitor ’ and 
through  briefing  with Farm Organisations,  Press and participation  at 
producer  meetings
• Participation  at major  Food Fairs and Trade  Shows
• Inward  buyer  missions  and outward  seller  missions  to forge  new business  
and consolidate  existing  links
The specific  approach  in each market  is as follows:
France
Promotions  of Irish lamb in France  for 1996 will concentrate  on selected  
top quality  lamb. The following  promotional  programme  will be carried  out:
• Irish  lamb will be promoted  from late May through  August  with the main 
retail groups.
179
• In the South  of France  promotions will extend into September.  Promotions  
of Irish lamb to the catering  sector  will also be intensified.
• The major  Food Fair ‘SIAL ’ takes plaee in Paris in October  1996 and 
Irish lamb will be given a eentral  role in that exhibition  of Irish Food.
Home  Market
The Easter  Lamb  Promotion  consisted  of:
• Colour  advertisements  in the National  Press and RTE Guide
• Distribution  of promotional  material  to all retail outlets
The Summer  Campaign  will include:
• Media  advertising  of lamb,  with lamb  joints  for roasts,  minced  lamb  for 
economical  and quick  mid-week  meals  and lamb  ehops  for best barbecues
• Consumer  education  programme  promoting  lamb as a convenient  good 
to eat, healthy  and affordable  meal option
• Point of sale material  to all retailers
• Special  Food Fairs / Agricultural  Shows

• CIBUS  Food Fair, Parma  9-13 May

Summary
The Irish  sheepmeat  industry after  a deeade  of growth  in output  and incomes 
is now at a turning  point. Ewe numbers  and the numbers  of producers  in the 
industry  have both fallen. Unless  action is taken to stabilise  returns,  further  
declines  may be inevitable.
European  markets  are, and are likely  to remain, tight  and highly  competitive.  
Exports  from the UK are likely to expand  further.  Imports  of New Zealand  
fresh product  are also likely to grow in the coming  years.
By improving  its cost  competitiveness,  and achieving  more uniform product 
quality, the Irish industry can enhance  its position  on export  markets and thereby  
make for a better  future  all round.

Current  and Future  Perspectives
M. HAMELL
European  Commission,  Brussels.
1. Introduction
Within  the meat sector,  sheepmeat  is a relatively  small player.  Of almost  
33 million  tonnes  of meat  production  in 1995 in the community,  sheepmeat  and 
goatmeat  accounted  for just 3.6%. In consumption  terms,  its share was just 
4.4%.  There  are about 700,000  producers.
But lamb is no longer  simply  competing  with other meats.  At the dinner  
table fish, cheese,  yoghurts  and an increasing  array of processed  products,  
vegetables  and fruits are all fighting  for a place on the table.
Family  size, eating  habits  and tastes  are changing  and convenience,  if not 
yet king, is certainly  heir apparent  in the meals  industry.  The implications  for 
producer  prices  in all these  changes  are highly  important. Consumers  have  many 
choices  before  them.  They can decide  to eat or not to eat lamb or other  meats  
and also the price  they are prepared  to pay. In meat  terms,  if lamb  is more  than 
3.5 times  the price  of poultry or more  than twice  the price  of pigmeat,  consumers  
tend to shy away from it.
The trends  in other  meat  and other  food  prices  have  a direct  long-term  effect  
on producer  prices  for lamb and this factor  has to be a major  element  in the 
prospects  for the sheep industry.
Regardless  of policy  and despite  changes  in the fortunes  of other  meats,  this 
is the long-term  market  reality  facing  the sheep sector.
2. Policy
The Community  sheep  sector  policy  has been  built  up over many  years  and 
is well-known.  The key elements  are:
• A Community  premium
• An individual  quota  system
• A GATTAVTO  based import  regime
3. Operation  of Policy
a. Premia
The Common  Community  premium  has been in place  since 1992 although  
Ireland  did obtain  a derogation  that year.  The logic behind  a common  premium  
is that, within  a single  market,  the opportunities  to sell are open to all. The 
market  inevitably  takes  account  of supply  and demand,  quality  differences  and 
consumer  preference.  Ireland  with 300% self sufficiency  is unlikely  ever to 
have the same price as France  which  is only 50% self sufficient.  But, it is a 
matter  for the entire Irish industry  to reduce  the gap.
In recent  years,  much less has been made  of the issue of the convergence  
of market  prices  in so far as the premium  is concerned.  Price  convergence  was 
not set as a target  in the 1989  reform  just as the convergence  of production  costs
181
was not set. In fact since  the introduction  of price reporting  based  on standard  
quality,  Irish prices  have tended  to converge  towards  the Community  average.  
In 1992, the Irish price was 74% of the Community  average  whereas  by 1994  
it had reached 82%  of the average.  In 1995, despite  the acknowledged  difficulties, 
the Irish price was again 82% of the Community  average.
b. Individual  quota  system
The individual  quota  system  was put into place  in the 1992 reform  as part 
of the more general  reform  of agriculture.
Its introduction  brought  to an end the  remarkable  increase  in sheep  numbers  
seen across  Northern  Europe  but particularly  in Ireland and  the United Kingdom  
since 1980.  Ewe numbers  declined  by 12% in Spain,  9% in Ireland,  6% in UK 
and rose by just 1 % in France  in the three  years  to the end of 1995 as producers  
adjusted  to quota.  Clearly,  production  without  quota  is not proving  interesting.
The introduction  of quotas  has brought  another  advantage  by way of the 
community  budget.  Community  expenditure  on the sheepmeat  sector,  which  
was rising  rapidly  in the late 80’s and early 90’s as production  increased  and 
prices  decreased,  has been brought  more firmly  under  control.  The cost of the 
ewe and rural world  premia  together  with the  relatively small  amount  for private  
storage  which  has grown  from 1800 MECU  in 1990 to surpass  2000 MECU  
in respect  of both the 1991 and ’92 marketing  years has been stabilized.
c. Import  regime
The changes  introduced  in the import  regime  via GATTAVTO  do not, in the 
short  term, alter the import  situation  to any major  extent.  Under  the voluntary  
restraint  agreements  adaptations  of 1989  and ’90theoverall  import  possibilities  
in the sheep  sector  were approximately  802,000  tonnes  at zero duty. This was 
in fact somewhat  less than the possibilities  available  in the period  prior  to then 
which  acted as the basis for the GATT  agreement.
Total Access  in 1996 at zero duty is approximately  315,000  tonnes.  The 
reasons  for the increased  access  are:
— The GATT  basis for the calculation  of access  (1986-88). At that time New
Zealand,  in particular,  had access  for 40,000  tonnes  more  than frorti 1990.
The development  of Association  Agreements  with  Eastern  countries  which
in the longer  term are to be Members  of the Community.
— The enlargement  of the community  to take in Sweden,  Finland  and  Austria.
In reality,  imports  of sheep  and sheepmeat  have not grown  in recent  years  
with total imports  reaching  about  250,000  tonnes  annually.  The most significant  
change  has been  that New  Zealand has, over  about  12 years,  redirected its exports 
to the Community  so that the UK now receives  only 50% of them as opposed  
to 90% in the past. On chilled  meat,  the growth  in imports  from New Zealand  
continues  to be in line with the 1500 tonne  annual  growth  formerly  agreed  in 
the adapted  VRA.  Imports  of NZ chilled  meat are forecast  to reach 16-17,000 
tonnes  in 1996.
182
4. Prospects
The overall  trends  in the market  place suggest  great stability  in the 
Community sheep  scene  in the next  five years.  The Commission  s forecast  group  
expects sheep  and ewe December  census  numbers  to remain  static  at 97 million  
and 70 million  head respectively  to the end of the century.  At Member  State  
level a similar  pattern  is forecast.
Production  may go down  slightly  but is expected  to be about 1.15 million  
tonnes  annually. It is possible,  of course, that some  increase  in production  could  
take place  as producers  react to higher  prices  this year due to problems  in the 
beef sector.
The prospects  for imports  are of considerable  interest.  Breeding  ewe numbers  
in New Zealand  have fallen  by 17 million  head in recent  years  and now stand  
at 33 million.  Dairying  and forestry  are now more attractive  enterprises.  New  
Zealand ’s overall  export  sheepmeat  production  has fallen  to about  350,000  tonnes  
product  weight. The Community  market  remains  the key but New Zealand  will 
want to maintain  its other  markets  around  the world.  In these circumstances,  
apart perhaps  from this year. New Zealand  may not quite fulfil its 226,700  
tonne  quota.
In Eastern  Europe,  the decline  over  the past five years  has been  remarkable.  
Sheep  numbers  have fallen  by about  50%, 12 million  head,  and as yet there is 
little sign of any recovery.  Countries  which  fulfilled  their  VRA  quantities  with 
ease in the past are now experiencing  serious  difficulties  in so doing.
It appears  therefore  that the overall  level of imports  of 250,000  tonnes  in 
recent  years is unlikely  to change  in the next few years.
As exports  are very small.  Community  consumption  will be a function,  as 
always,  of production  and imports. The declining  trend  in British  consumption,  
so evident  in recent  years,  may be reversed  this year as British  consumers  turn 
to domestic  and New Zealand  lamb.  This,  in turn, may leave  rather  more  room  
on the French  market.
Prices  in the past two months  have risen substantially  in the UK, France,  
Ireland  and to a lesser  extent  in Spain.  Elsewhere  the price rise has not been 
as dramatic.
Longer  term,  as I indicated  earlier,  sheep  prices  are subject  to other  forces.
The difficulty  of forecasting  prices  can be appreciated  when one looks at 
the situation  each spring  over  the past  five years.  In ’92 spring  lamb  prices  were  
low due to the effects  of the ending  of the variable  slaughter  premium  in Great  
Britain;  in ’93 they were  high due to foot and mouth  disease  in Eastern  Europe,  
in ’94 they were high due to the late spring  in Northern  Europe;  in ’95 they 
were low due to over supply  and lower  prices  for other  meats  while  this year 
they have been high.
5. Policy  for the future
Few people  in this audience  will be unaware  that the Council  has asked  the 
Commission  to report  to it before  1 st July this year  on the operation  of the quota
system.  , . .
The preparatory  work for this report  is underway.  The Commission  in due
183
time will present  it to the Council.  I am not in a position,  nor am I foolish  
enough,  to try to indicate  what the conclusions  of the report  will be. This is a 
matter  for the Commission  itself  and not for one of its officials.
However,  the remarks  I have made already  indicate  that the quota has 
succeeded  in bringing  production  and budgetary  expenditure  under  greater  
control  and thus it is one of the more successful  measures  ever taken within 
the sheep  regime.
Several  commentators  appear  to believe  that the report  will be the time for 
putting  all the problems  they perceive  onto the Council  table for resolution.  
Thus,  top up premia,  the stabilizer  mechanism,  extensification  premia  and the 
definition  of the eligible  ewe all risk being aired in one form or another  in 
coming  months.
The Commission  is due to prepare  a second  report  on the sheep  sector  before  
the end of the year, this time on the implementation  of carcase  classification.  
Subject  to the conclusions  of that report,  the Council  shall set itself  the goal 
of making  the use  of the Community  grid compulsory  in slaughterhouses  during  
the 1999 marketing  year or by 1 January  2000 at the latest.
6. Conclusions
Against  the background  I have outlined  above  the most likely  prospect  is 
that the next years  will be relatively  calm within  the sheep  sector.  But the sheep  
sector  does not, of course,  live in isolation  from the remainder  of agriculture  
or from the more general  development  of the Community.
A series  of future  developments  inevitably  will impinge  on the sector.  The 
most obvious  of these  are the next round  of the World  Trade  talks due to start 
in a few years,  the next enlargement  of the Community  and the pressures  on 
and the requirements  of the Community  both politically  and in budget  terms.
The  outcome  of discussion  and negotiation  on all these items  could,  of course, 
bring  changes  to the sheep  regime  over the longer  term.  So indeed  could  other  
changes  in funding  measures  for agriculture.  But, these are not at or indeed 
very close  to the table  now. In the meantime, the  sector  faces  a period  of stability  
in production  and consumption  terms.  In those  circumstances,  the development  
of the industry  continues  to depend  on consistent  improvement  of production,  
processing  and marketing.

1. INTRODUCTION
Grassland  is Ireland ’s greatest  renewable  feed resource  and it provides  the 
main  feed  for ruminant  livestock.  Over  90% of agricultural  land is under  grass ­
land (including  rough  grazing).  Grassland  (excluding  rough  grazing)  accounts  
for 4.3  X 10'’ hectares,  of which  30% is used for silage  and hay production  and 
the remaining  70%  for grazing.  Grazed  grass,  followed  by conserved  grass,  are 
the cheapest  renewable  feeds  available  (Table  1). As the majority  of cattle  are 
Spring-born,  grazed  and conserved  grass are logically  the basis for efficient  
beef production  systems.  As a producer  of livestock,  over 80% of which is 
exported,  Ireland  has few competitive  advantages,  but its ability  to grow grass  
does offer  the chance  to provide  cattle  (and sheep)  with a relatively  cheap  feed 
source.  A national  balance  sheet by McLoughlin  (1991)  for the 6 year period  
1983/84  to 1988/89,  shows  grazed  grass, conserved  grass  and concentrates  con­
tributing  57%,  29% and 14% of dry matter  intake  for beef  cattle,  respectively,  
accounting  for 30%,  35% and 34% of the feed costs  (Table  2). The feed  cost  for 
some more intensive  beef systems  (Table  3) shows  the proportional  cost for 
grazed  grass  at 28%,  conserved  feeds  at 42% and concentrates  at 30%.

The key to efficient  beef  production  from grass,  now and in the future,  is to 
operate  a flexible,  adjustable  grassland  management  programme,  using  factual  
information  for prompt  and appropriate  decision-making  purposes.  The sys­
tem operated  must clearly  match  feed supply  to animal  requirements,  putting  
the major  emphasis  on increasing  the proportion  of cattle  diets that comes  from  
grazed  grass. The aim of this paper is thus to describe  the technologies  by 
which  beef can best be produced  from grazed  and conserved  grassland,  to re­
late these  to current  practices  and to identify  and quantify  the opportunities  for 
future  improvements.

2. CURRENT  PRACTICES  ON FARMS
a) Soil nutrient  status
Recent  soil analysis  results  (Gately,  1996) show that the average  lime re­
quirement  for soils is 6.2 tonnes/ha.  Farmers  who had soils analysed  as part of 
the Rural Environment  Protection  Scheme  (REPS)  had an average  soil lime 
requirement  of 7 t/ha, compared  with 5.2 t/ha for other  farms. Soil P readings  
were 7 and 8.7 mg/1 and K readings  were 108 and 110 mg/1 for REPS  and non- 
REPS  sources,  respectively.
b) Sward  type
Most of the grassland  in Ireland  is old pasture. Based  on the quantities  of 
grass-seeds  sold, about 3% of the agricultural  land is reseeded  in any year.  
Much of the reseeding  is carried  out on land primarily  used for winter  feed 
production.  Cattle  thus tend to graze  old pasture  for most of the season.
187
c) Management  standards
Using the 1994 Teagasc  National  Farm Survey (NFS) data, Hickey 
(1996;  Tables  4 to 8) described  the characteristics  of cattle-producing  farms,  
and showed  that beef  farmers  in general  use low inputs  of nitrogen  (<65 kg N/ 
ha/year)  and other nutrients  and operate  a relatively  low stocking  rate (1.36 
livestock  unit/ha).  He showed  considerable  scope  to improve  animal  produc ­
tivity and utilisation  of grassland.  Farm profile  data for more intensive,  spe­
cialised  suckler  farms  have been compiled  by Barlow  and Smyth  (1996)  using 
the 1994 Beefmis  survey  results  (Tables  9 and 10). These  farms,  operating  at 
an above  average  technical  efficiency,  had a stocking  rate of 2 livestock  units/  
hectare,  while  performance  at grass for weanlings  and older  progeny  was 1.1 
and 0.9 kg liveweight  gain per day, respectively.  Barlow  and Smyth  (1996) 
reported  an animal  output  of 500 to 700 kg liveweight/ha,  which  is much higher  
than the national  average  figure  of 350 kg (Hickey,  1996). Both sources  of data 
show  that currently  average  costs  of production  are distributed  equally  between  
fixed  and variable  costs.
d) Cost  of grass  production
Grass  growth  is affected  by a range  of factors,  some  of which  are outside  the 
control  of the farmer.  For example,  factors  such as weather, geographical  loca­
tion and soil type have a major  influence  on grass  growth  and consequently  on 
the cost of feeding  livestock.  Geographical  location  significantly  affects  the 
date of the start and end of the grazing  season  and Figure 1 shows  that the 
beginning  of tbe grazing  season  in the south  and south-west  is at least 3 weeks 
earlier  than the north  and north-east.  A time difference  also exists  at the end of 
the grass-growing  season,  where the  south  and south-west  again  have up to a 3- 
week advantage.  The effects  of the above  factors  on the costs of producing  
grass are shown  in Table 11. For the same soil type and level of inputs,  the 
effect  of geographical  location  means  that grass yields  can range  from almost  
16 t DM/ha  to less than 101 DM/ha  (Figure  2). Translated  into feed cost terms, 
the effect  of location  results  in costs ranging  from £37 to £52/t DMD  (digest ­
ible dry matter). Weather,  which  can cause  considerable  variation  in year to 
year annual  grass production  (i.e. -i- or - 20% difference  from the long term 
average),  can alter production  costs from £42 to £63/t  DMD. Excess  soil wet­
ness can result in production  costs that range from £47 (dry) to £56 (wet)/t  
DMD.
The main factors  controlling  grass growth  which  are directly  influenced  by 
farming  practices  are soil fertility,  nitrogen  usage and grazing  management.  
Now  more  than ever,  farmers  have to be cost conscious  and each  input has to be 
justified.  For grazed  grassland,  fertilisers  account  for 80% of the input costs 
associated  with grass production.  It is an essential  requirement  that each farmer 
knows  the soil nutrient  status  of their land. The decision  to apply  fertilisers  to 
grazing  grassland,  especially  phosphorus  (P) and potassium  (K), has to be made  
against  the background  of a knowledge  of soil nutrient  status.
Nitrogen  is the one major input at the farmers  disposal  which can be 
used to influence  grass  growth. The effect  of nitrogen  application  on grass

growth is shown  in Table 12. These  data are based  on a country-wide  study  
(Ryan,  1974)  where  all of the major  soil types  were included each  year  over  the 
four years  of the study. Dry matter  yields  continued  to increase  up to an appli ­
cation  rate of 400 kg N/ha (360 units/ac).  However,  the grass yield response  
(%) in terms of extra grass grown  for each 50 kg N applied/ha  (45 units/ac)  
declined  from 13% to 12%, 11%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 5%, 3% and 0% as the rate of 
nitrogen  increased  to 450 kg N/ha. Table 12 also shows  the cost of producing  
the extra  grass,  in terms  of £/tonne  DMD,  for each extra  50 kg N applied/ha.  An 
attractive  response  is achieved  with the lower levels of nitrogen  applied  
but grass production  costs increased  with each increment  of nitrogen  used

Increasing  nitrogen  usage  from 300 to 350 kg N/ha (270 to 310 units/ac)  re­
sulted  in a yield  increase  of 5% and the cost of the extra  grass  was £ 121/t DMD. 
Grass costs of this magnitude  are very expensive  and alternative  purchased  
feeds  could  be economically  more  attractive.
3. CURRENT  RESEARCH  STANDARDS
a) Chronology  of recent  advances
In reflecting  the national  importance  of the contribution  of the suckler  herd 
and the progeny  from  the dairy  herd to the Irish  beef  industry, Grange  Research  
Centre  has for a considerable  number  of years being researching  systems  of 
producing  beef  from  these  sources.  Both  systems  take  calves  from  birth  through  
to slaughter,  in most  cases  at 20 months  (heifers)  or 23 to 26 months  (steers)  of 
age. Table 13 shows  the progression  of advancements  in these  systems  over  the 
past 15 years, and suggests  likely output  for the near future  through  further  
improved  technologies  (including  grassland management).  It is clear  that through 
technological  improvements  both  systems  have been steadily  increasing  output  
and efficiency.  Present  outputs  are 730  and 500 kg carcass/hectare  for the Dairy 
Calf-to-Beef  and Suckler  Calf to Beef  systems,  respectively.  These  outputs  
contrast  sharply  with those  reported  on commercial  farms (Teagasc  NFS, Hickey 
1996; Barlow  and Smyth,  1996).
b) Current  Grange  systems
(i) Suckler Calf  to Beef  System
The present  system  (Drennan,  1993),  based  on early-March  calving,  finishes  
animals  at 20 (heifers)  and 24 (steers)  month  of age. The system  is stocked  at 
0.84 ha per cow unit (cow -i- calf -i- year old -i- replacements),  has a carcass  
output  of 500 kg per hectare  per year. This target  is achieved  by producing  a 
steer carcass  weight  of 400 kg, heifer  carcase  weight  of 300 kg and cull cow 
carcase  weight  of 400 kg. The target  output (carcass/ha)  is achieved  from 10

tonnes  of herbage  dry matter  (DM)  plus a concentrate  input  of 820 kg/ha. Herb ­
age production  is based  on 230 kg N/ha,  and silage  being  harvested  from 55% 
of the farm in late-May,  and 35% of the farm area in late July. Silage  harvested  
in May is fed to the progeny,  while  the July-conserved  swards  are offered  to the 
cows. Cows  and calves  graze  separately  from  the older  cattle. Rotational  graz­
ing, with 10-12  paddocks  per animal  group,  is practised.  The grazing  season  
starts  in mid-April,  and silage  areas  are not currently  grazed  early in the season.  
Calves  are weaned  in mid-October  and housed  shortly  afterwards,  while  cows  
typically  remain  outdoors  at pasture  until late-November.  Steers  are housed  in 
mid-October  while heifers  are housed  in September  and finished  by mid-  
December.  Variable  costs  for the system  are 92-94  p, while  fixed  costs are 170- 
180 p/kg carcass.
For the Suckler  Calf-to-Beef  sytem.  Table  14 shows  the liveweights  achieved  
and the proportions  derived  from grazed  grass,  forage  and concentrates.  Two- 
thirds  of the lifetime  gain for the progeny  from the suckler  system  is produced  
during  the grazing  season.  The liveweight  gain during  the first grazing  season  
amounts  to 220 kg (females)  and 250 kg (males)  or almost  60% of the animals  
lifetime  gain. The indoor  winter  period  accounts  for one-third  of the lifetime  
weight  gains. The proportion  of gain achieved  by heifers  is small  in the second  
winter  as animals  are slaughtered  early  (at 20 months  of age). However,  almost  
half of the indoor  liveweight  gains are achieved  through  concentrate  feeding.  
All of the liveweight  gain achieved  on the cows is derived  from grazed  grass.
(ii) Dairy  Calf  to Beef  System
The present  system  at Grange  (Keane  and Drennan,  1989)  involves  purchas ­
ing March  born calves  (7 to 14 days old) from dairy herds  and finishing  them

24 months  later. Both Friesian  and Friesian/Charolais  crosses  are used. Calves  
are reared  indoors  for the first 10 to 12 weeks  and go to grass in early May.  
Prior  to 1995,  yearlings  were turned  out to grass  in mid-April  and did not graze  
the areas designated  for silage.  However,  this has now changed,  with silage-  
ground  being  grazed  in early Spring. Sixty percent  of the farm area is cut for 
silage  in late May, with a further  40% cut in late July. Animals  are stocked  at 
0.45 ha/animal  unit (yearling  plus calf). Herbage  production  is about 10 tonnes  
DM/ha  and together  with  a concentrate  input  of 2.2 tonnes/ha,  produces  750 kg 
carcass  per hectare.  The concentrate  input  at 1 tonne  per animal  is made  up by 
feeding  100 kg at the calf  stage  (including  some  at grass  in the autumn),  150 kg 
during  the first winter  and the remainder  during  the second  winter.  A rotational  
grazing  system  involving  6 paddocks  up to June and 8 paddocks  at the end of 
the year has been practised.  Cost of production  are estimated  to be £2.04/kg  
carcass.  The main components  of this cost are, 84p for the calf  purchase,  9lp 
for variable  costs and 29 p for fixed costs.
194
In the Dairy Calf  to Beef  System  (Table  15), lifetime  weight  increases  of 565 
and 630 kg per head are achieved  for Charolais  x Friesian  and Friesian  steers,  
respectively.  Fifty to 55% of the gain is achieved  at pasture  and a further  25% 
is achieved  from  forage  indoors.  A greater  proportion  (55%)  of the weight  gain 
is achieved  during  the second  year at pasture  when  compared  with the Suckler  
Calf to Beef  System.  Weight  gains during  the final winter  are almost  double  
those  achieved  during  the first winter.
Ohe of the main features  of both Calf to Beef  Systems  is the high stocking  
rate achieved  in the early part of the season  (Table  16). Both systems  reach  a 
peak in early June of 3000 kg liveweight/ha  and this nevertheless  results  in 
high animal  gains  and provides  sufficient  areas  to be conserved  for winter  feed.  
The long-term  future  of beef  production  systems  in Ireland  will depend  on inte­
grated  Calf-to-Beef  systems  with a major  proportion  of the lifetime  liveweight  
gain being  derived  from grazed  grass.
c) Grazing  management  strategies
(i) General  principle
The objectives  of grazing  management  are to produce  high yields  of quality  
grass  over a long grazing  season  and to manage  both the cattle  and grass  so as 
to utilise  the sward  as efficiently  as possible  while  getting  high levels  of animal  
intake  and thus achieve  high levels  of animal  output.
(ii) Producing  grass
As stated  earlier,  grass  production  is affected  by many  factors,  some  outside  
the farmers  control  (location  altitude,  aspect  etc.) and others  which  are directly  
affected  by farm management  decisions.
Soil nutrition  Getting  the basic soil nutrition  such as lime, phosphorus  and 
potassium  correct  are key factors  in grass  production.  The minimum  that needs  
to be known  are:
a) soil pH, which  gives  a measure  of soil acidity  and the soil lime requirement,
and
b) phosphorus  (P) and potassium  (K) status
A knowledge  of potential  trace element  problems  is highly  desirable.  In 
terms of lime application, its relationship  with  overall  soil fertility, grass  growth  
and animal  production  are of the greatest  importance.  With very few excep ­
tions, liming  of grassland  to raise the soil pH to at least 6.0 is nearly  always  
justified.  The effects  of lime on improved  nutrient  availability,  increased  pro­
portions  of more desirable  grasses  in the sward,  a better  response  to applied  
fertilisers,  especially  nitrogen,  and thus to an overall  improvement  in animal  
output  is well documented  and accepted.  An example  of the beneficial  effect  of 
lime application  over the subsequent  four years is shown  in Table 17. More  
grass  was produced  (+28%)  and more  animals  (+47%)  were carried  as a result  
of lime application.  The net effect  of applying  lime was to get an extra grass  
production  response  each year equivalent  to 75 kg N/ha (60 units/ac).

Annual dressings  of phosphorus  and potassium  to grazed  grasslands  are some ­
times neglected.  Application  rates must he related  to stocking  rates  and soil 
test results.  Little  loss in production  on grazing  land will be seen by omitting  
one year ’s application  of phosphorus  or potassium.  However,  long-term  stud­
ies at Johnstown  Castle  and Grange  have shown  that annual  applications  of 15 
or 30 kg.  P/ha (12 to 24 units/ac)  compared  with no phosphorus  were  associated  
with 15 to 25% extra  liveweight  gain per year. Thus,  an annual  application  of 
15 kg P/ha (13 units/ac)  is recommended  to maintain  soil P levels  on grazed  
grassland.  Animal  production  responses  to applications  of potassium  (K) are

small under  grazing,  but its role in conservation  is of great importance.  For 
grazing  an annual  application  of 30 kg K/ha  (27 units/ac)  will supply  sufficient  
potassium  for grass  growth.
Numerous  studies  have been conducted  to look at the relationships  between  
nitrogen  usage  and animal  output.  Figure  3 summarises  the results  of a 4 year 
experiment  outlining  the outputs,  measured  as liveweight  gain/hectare,  in re­
sponse  to increasing  levels  of nitrogen  (Brown  and Walsh, 1966). Both old 
pasture  and reseeds  were  compared.  With  old pasture,  an increase  in liveweight  
was obtained  through  the use of 200 kg N/ha/year  (180 units/acre).  However, 
with new swards,  output  continued  to increase  in response  to well over 300 kg 
N/ha (270 units/acre),  although  at a slower  rate. Data from the National  Farm  
Survey  (1994)  shows  the average  nitrogen  input  on drystock  farms  to be less 
than 65 kg N/ha (55 units/acre).  The output  potential  of these farms could  
readily  be increased  by 33% in response  to additional  nitrogen  (if livestock  
were  available).  While  national  quotas  have placed  restrictions  on the number  
of cattle  for which  premia  payments  are attainable,  in the longer  term  Ireland ’s 
ability  to cash-in  on a natural  competitive  advantage  depends  on our ability  to 
produce  high yields  of grass and efficiently  convert  them to beef While  most 
farms  have the capacity  to expand  livestock  numbers,  any expansion  must be 
done with careful  management  of costs.
Sward  type Sward  type has a major  influence  on output  of herbage  and 
animal  output,  and for the foreseeable  future  swards  based  on perennial  ryegrass  
seem to be the obvious  preferred  choice  of sward. With  current  plant  breeding  
approaches,  the present  rate of advancement  in dry matter  yield increase  is 
likely  to remain  at 0.5 to 1% per year, unless  new biotechnological  advances  
take place.
Management  Management,  involving  timeliness  of operations  and a knowl ­
edge of plant response  to varying  fertiliser  application  rates and dates, will 
remain  critical  to producing  high yields  of grass.
(Hi) Utilising  grass
Grass  utilisation  is discussed  below. The main emphasis  is on:
• knowing  (measuring)  grass supply
• knowing  animal  feed requirements  (kg DM/head/day)
• matching  supply  and requirements.  This will be achieved  through
- rotational  paddock  grazing  system
- moving  cattle  when  swards  have  been tightly  grazed  (target height,  herb­
age mass)
- knowing,  identifying  and storing  surplus  grass
- re-introducing  the stored  surplus  at times  of deficit  or, if necessary,  sup­
plementing  with other  feeds
Successful  beef production  from grazed  grassland  depends  on having  a 
PLANNED  MANAGEMENT  SYSTEM  which  allows  for FLEXIBILITY  
as conditions  change.  As grazed  grass is the main feed component,  a knowl ­
edge  of its growth  pattern  and stock-carrying  capacity  is important.  Grass  growth 
is seasonal  and can change  widely  over short  periods  of time. The rate of grass

Fig 4. Grass  Growth  at Grange  Research  Centre  
1993/94/95/96
growth  for Grange  Research  Centre,  expressed  in kg DM/ha/day  is shown  in 
Figure  4. One general trend  is evident  and that is that once  mid-April  is reached,  
grass growth  increases  rapidly,  and during  May values  of 100 kg DM/ha/day  
are common.  At that level of growth  each  hectare  is capable  of supporting  up to 
5 livestock  units (2 LU/ac)  assuming  that each LU is offered  20 kg DM/day.  
Once mid-June  has passed  there is an inevitable  decrease  in grass growth,  so 
that by mid-August  pastures  will only support  half of the May stocking  rate. 
There  is nevertheless  big variation  between  years. Thus, for example,  grass  
growth  during  early April 1994 and 1996 was 10 kg DM/ha/day  or less com­
pared  with 20 to 30 kg DM/ha/day  in 1993 and 1995. During  1994, over a 3- 
week  period  in late-April  to mid-May,  grass  growth  increased  10-fold  from 12 
to 120 kg DM/ha/day,  but then proceeded  to 40 kg DM/ha/day  during  the fol­
lowing  four weeks.  It then increased  to 80 kg DM/ha/day  within  the next 3- 
weeks  and finally  decreased  steadily  over  the remainder  of the season.  Similar  
fluctuations  are evident  most  years.  To fully exploit  this changing  grass  supply, 
a flexible  management  system  is required.  A system  that allows  the tanner to 
see up-coming  shortages  as well as short-term  surpluses  needs to be practised  if
199
grass  is to be utilised  efficiently  and economically.  A rotational  grazing  system  
offers  the flexibility  necessary  to make  these management  decisions.  As most 
farms  are composed  of a number  of fields,  which  vary in size, the introduction  
of a rotational  grazing  system  is not necessarily  too difficult.  Subdivisions  do 
not need to be of equal  size. The greater  the number  of fields  or paddocks  that 
are available,  the greater  is the flexibility  introduced  into the grassland  man­
agement  process.  While  keeping  control  on costs,  a target  of 10-12  paddocks  
(not necessarily  of equal size) in the Spring-Summer  period  offers  sufficient  
flexibility  to manage  grass in a variable  supply  situation.
The aim of each  cattle  farmer  must  be to  maximise  the intake  of grazed  grass  
by cattle  in an efficient  manner  and to get maximum  animal  gains  over as long 
a grazing  season  as possible.  For efficient  beef production  from grassland,  a 
balance  is needed  between  the ability  of grassland  to support  stock  during  the 
grazing  season  and the provision  of adequate  Winter  feed. Inadequate  Winter  
feed,  especially  in terms  of quality, is still a serious  limitation  on many  drystock  
farms. Inadequate  stocks  of winter  feed means  prolonged  winter  grazing,  with 
little liveweight  gains (indeed  weight  losses will occur)  and damage  to pas­
tures. Late closing  of swards  as a result  of uncontrolled  grazing  in Autumn/  
Winter  means  delayed  Spring  grass growth,  so that when stock  are turned-out  
early,  through  necessity  as a result  of Winter  feed shortage,  performance  is poor  
and pasture  production  suffers  as a result  of over grazing.  Early  turnout  to an 
adequate  supply of Spring  grass is highly  desirable,  firstly,  in terms  of improved  
animal  gains,  secondly  to achieve  a long grazing  season  and thirdly  to reduce  
costs  associated  with the more  expensive  Winter  period.
Knowing  grass  supply  A knowledge  of grass  supply  at all times  of the year  
is essential  if informed  management  decisions  are to be made. While  issues 
such as rotation  length  and rest interval  are of great importance  to planned  
grassland  management,  a knowledge  of pasture  supply  or pasture  cover  on a 
weekly  basis (if not daily)  is essential  if the best use is to be made  of grass.
All grassland  farmers  should  have the skills  to quantify  pasture  sward  height  
and pasture  yields  (sometimes  referred  to as pasture  cover). Tables  which  re­
late sward  height  (compressed  heights)  to yield have been produced  at Grange.  
As a simple  guide,  each centimeter  of compressed  grass  above 4 cm of stubble  
contains  approximately  150 kg DM/ha.  The use of sward  height  for grassland  
measurements  are more fully discussed  in the attached  Appendix.  An assess ­
ment  of pasture  cover  may be obtained  by frequently  (once  per week)  walking  
the entire  grazing  area and measuring  sward  height. The measurement  can be 
made  with a sward  stick,  ruler  or place  meter. Eye assessment  can also be used 
to estimate  pasture  availability.  Once  the technique  of pasture  cover  measure ­
ment  is mastered,  it is surprising  how quickly  small  changes  in pasture  supply  
will be detected.  An example  of pasture  cover  (Figure  5 & 6) on the Grange  
Dairy  Calf to Beef System  for 1996 is shown. At turnout,  a pasture  cover  of 
500 kg DM/ha  was present  over  the grazing  area (40%  of farm). This increased  
to a peak of 1500 kg DM/ha  in early June  when  surplus grass (20% of area)  was 
removed  and a cover  of 800 to 1000  kg was maintained  until early  August  when  
silage  aftermath  became  available.

Start  of spring  grazing/autumn  closing  dates Late closing  of swards  as a 
result  of prolonged  uncontrolled  grazing  in Autumn/early  Winter  has a negative  
effect  on Spring  grass  supply.  Table 18 shows  that when  swards  are closed  in 
mid-October  compared  with mid-December,  yields  in mid-March  and early  April  
were 78% higher  following  the earlier  closing  date. Yields  from mid-Novem ­
ber closing  date were intermediate.  Apart  from less grass in Spring,  there is a 
total loss to the system  because  the amount  of grass  grazed  in the Autumn  as a

result  of the delay  in closing  is less than the difference  between  the two Spring  
yields. It should  be the aim of all livestock  farmers  to have some  of the farm 
closed  or rested  from mid-October  onwards  to provide  early Spring  grass. A 
rotational  grazing  system  facilitates  an orderly  closing  of pastures  in Autumn.
The importance  of adequate  Spring  grass supply  and of its effect  on beef 
output  is shown  in Table 19. With an inadequate  supply  of grass on April 1, 
animal  output  was 17% poorer  than when  grazing  started  one week  later,  which

in turn was inferior  to starting  grazing  on April 15. Delaying  the start of 
grazing  until April 22 reduced  total production  for the year because  the excess  
supply  resulted  in stemmy  pastures  of lower  quality.  Alternatively,  the earliest  
grazing  date resulted  in inadequate  grass supply  and not only reduced  animal 
performance  but also resulted  in the need for an earlier  reduction  in stocking  
rate in mid-summer.  Consequently,  when  pastures  have  a herbage  mass  (yield) 
of approximately  1000 kg DM/ha  (in the grazing  horizon)  or a sward  height  of 
approximately  8 cm (compressed  sward  height),  pasture  supply  should,  in most  
years, be sufficient  to support  the full livestock  grazing  requirements  on the 
grazing  areas.
202
Any grazing  of silage  swards  in Spring  will reduce  silage  yields. However,  
provided  that the final grazing  is done before  April 10, a reduction  in silage  
yield of not greater  than 15% can be expected.  When  the amounts  of herbage  
consumed  by the animals  is allowed  for, the net quality  effect  of Spring  grazing  
of silage  swards  is likely  to be less than 5%. Thus,  grazed  grass  has replaced  a 
more  expensive  winter  feed (but the remaining  winter  feed may be more  expen ­
sive). Recent  Grange  results  (O’Riordan,  1996)  have shown  that in a planned  
grazing  system,  up to 3 weeks  grazing  can be obtained  on silage swards  in 
Spring. The earlier  the sward  is closed  after grazing  the smaller  is the silage  
yield reduction.  All silage  swards  should  be closed  by April 10 at the latest.  
Better  animal  performance  has been achieved  at the end of the grazing  season  
through  this early turnout  and a net extra 10 to 15 kg liveweight  gain per head  
has been measured  at Grange  as a consequence  of going  to grass  early. In this 
situation,  herbage  mass  (yield)  on the silage  swards  was only 500-750  kg DM/  
ha in the grazing  horizon  (above  4 cm). Furthermore,  a rotational  grazing  of 
silage  swards,  where  paddocks  are grazed only once,  results  in a series  of Spring  
closing  dates  and thus a smaller  yield reduction.  At a pasture  supply  of 1000  kg 
DM/ha  or greater  in early  April,  silage  swards  do not need to be grazed  because  
there  is sufficient  DM on the grazing  land to carry  the cattle.
Controlled  grazing  in Spring The ability  of well-managed  grass  swards  to 
produce  high yields  of herbage  and liveweight  in April/June  is underestimated  
by most livestock  farmers.  It is the stage where  the greatest  wastage  of valu­
able feed takes  place  on farms.  Grass  growth  rates vary considerably  from year 
to year and location  to location,  but over half of the annual  grass yield is pro­
duced  in the April/June  period.  In most cases,  this high yield of high quality  
herbage  is not managed  correctly  and its true feeding  value is not well used.  
The failure  to adequately  convert  this valuable  feed resource  has a number  of 
consequences.  Firstly,  while  satisfactory  animal  gains  are achieved  in the short  
term (April/May),  the performance  for the subsequent  months  suffers  as stock  
are grazing  poor quality,  stemmy,  rejected  herbage.  Animals  do not need to 
have huge masses of herbage  (greater  than 3000 kg DM/ha)  in order  to give 
satisfactory performance.  Secondly,  because  of under-utilisation,  which  in some  
situations  is less than 50%,  pasture  output  is depressed  for the remainder  of the 
season.  Thirdly,  pasture  quality  is poor  and swards  which  had a DMD  value  of 
750 g/kg in mid-May  (capable  of producing  a liveweight  gain of 1 kg or greater/  
head/day)  drop to around  650 g/kg DMD  in June and July with the result  that 
animal  weight  gains suffer. Fourthly,  as pasture  growth  rates fall off, animals  
will be forced  to eat into a stubble  of very low quality  with the result  that gains  
in mid to late season  will be poor, a phenomenon  seen on many farms. This 
cycle of surplus  grass growth  early in the season  and the inability  to subse ­
quently  capture  it in an efficient  manner  is repeated  yearly  on many  farms.
Recent  Grange  research  has shown  that high stocking  rates in Spring  can be 
associated  with high levels  of animal  performance  both in the short and long 
term. Data in Table  20 show that over a 3 year period  high performance  was 
achieved  over an extended  period  of time. On swards  receiving  200 kg N/ha,  a 
daily liveweight  gain of over 1.1 kg was achieved  from early April until mid-
203

August  on swards  stocked  at 3000  kg liveweight/hectare  at turnout.  The graz­
ing pressure  had increased  to 4000  kg liveweight/hectare  in mid August  before 
a stocking  rate reduction  took place. Similarly,  clover-based  swards  receiving  
only 50 kg N/ha in February,  and stocked  at 2500  kg liveweight/ha  at turnout,  
were able to achieve  weight  gains of over 1.1 kg/day  during  the period  from 
early  April until mid August.  These  latter  swards  were supporting  a stocking  
rate of 3000 kg/ha  in mid August.  These  animal  performances  at grass were 
achieved  with animals  weighing  550 kg in April, and that had gained  0.9 kg/ 
day during  the previous  winter. As well as achieving  these levels  of animal 
gain at high stocking  rates,  the use of flexible  grassland  management  allowed  
up to 25% of the grazing  area be removed  as surplus  grass for ensiling.  These  
high daily gains and stocking  rates are achieved  on the basis that most of the 
seasons  growth  (60%)  takes  place  in April/June  (Table  21) and that the feeding  
quality  is high  (750  g/kg DMD)  if well managed.  In Table 20, increasing  stock ­
ing rate from  2000  to 3000  kg liveweight/ha,  thereby  releasing  50% of the land 
area, only depressed  daily gain by 10%. In terms  of response  to applied  ferti­
liser nitrogen,  the best response  is achieved  during  the months  of April/June.  It 
is then clear  that most  of the winter  feed requirements  should  be obtained  early 
in the season  (May/June).  Trying  to achieve  a large proportion  of the winter  
feed requirement  after mid summer  is most likely  to be unsuccessful.
Guidelines  for grazing  swards  in Spring  should  centre  on a rest interval  of 
not greater  than 24 to 26 days. Rest intervals  greater  than these,  while  growing  
more  grass,  will lead to poor  pasture  utilisation  and thus lead to swards  of lower  
quality  later in the season. Data from Grange  show that grazing  to a stubble  
height  of 5 to 5.5 cm (compressed  sward  height)  or a residual  mass of 500 to 
600 kg DM/ha  during  April to July, resulted  in gains  of over 1.1 kg liveweight/  
head/day.
With proper  grassland  management,  animals  can achieve  a steady rate of 
gain over a long grazing  season. Recent  Grange  data (Figures  7 and 8) show

that where  pasture  quality  is maintained  and when herbage  supply  and herd 
demand  are matched,  animals  can grow at a steady  rate from April through  to 
November.  Similarly,  where  overstocking  took place  in Autumn,  performance  
was poor. Most  pastures  will only support  1200  to 1400  kg liveweight/ha  from  
October  onwards  and for higher  stocking  rates  a carryover  of pasture  from  ear­
lier in the season  (August/September)  is necessary.  A rotational  grazing  system 
makes  this approach  more practical.  The demand  and supply  of grass on the 
Grange  Suckler  and Dairy  Calf to Beef  Systems  are shown  in Figure  9. The 
data shows  grass growth  rates and herd demand  per hectare  on a daily basis. 
Once grass growth  starts to increase,  grass supply  exceeds  demand  for mid 
April onwards  until late August,  at which time all of the farm is needed  to 
supply  the herd demand.  With,  for example,  a demand  for grass  of 20 kg DM/  
ha/day  on the full farm or 50 kg DM/ha/day  on 40% of the area a yield  of 1000  
kg DM at turnout  has sufficient  grass  for 20 days. For suckler  cows  before  the 
end of the first grazing  cycle,  all animals  will be at pasture  (all cows calved)  
and the herd daily requirement  is increased  from 50 to 75 kg DM/day.  With  
1000 kg DM/ha  on offer, there are only 13 to 14 days feed available.  Grass  
growth  rates will increase  each day and will exceed  75 kg DM/ha/day  before  
the end of the first grazing  cycle  resulting  in grass  supplies  building  up.
Transferring  grass from times  of surplus  to times  of scarcity  has been much 
discussed  in recent  years. There  is surprisingly  little scientific  data relating  to 
the practice  of what has become  known  as extended  grazing.  Grange  results  
over the past 3 years  have shown  that the grass,  if available,  can be carried  as a 
standing  crop in Autumn  for 6 weeks  or more with no advantage  of a longer  
rotation,  even though  pasture  quality  (DMD)  is maintained  for periods  of 9 to 
10 weeks. However,  Figure  9, shows  that from September  onwards,  herd de-

mand  matches  supply,  so that carrying  feed supply  for 6 weeks  into October  or 
November  is unlikely  to take place  as there is not sufficient  grass  to do so. As 
provision  of sufficient  winter  feed is a key issue  in attaining  high stocking  rates,  
and conserving  35 to 40% of the farm in late July is an integral  part of the 
management  programme,  the scope  for surplus  grass  in the absence  of omitting  
some  second  cut areas  seems  limited.  However,  on farms  where  most  or all of 
the Winter  feed  comes  from a single  May/June  harvest,  the chances  of carrying  
feed from August/September  should  be an option,  but have yet to be assessed.
d) Forage  for Winter  feeding  , r i
Provision  of adequate  winter  feed is a key to efficient,  high levels  of animal  
output Silage  quality  is of major  importance  where  farmers  want  high rates of 
animal production  from  silage-fed  cattle. Consistently  achieving  well preserved  
silage  of high digestibility  (DMD)  is difficult  but attainable.  Weather  patterns,  
both  directly  and indirectly,  impact  in a very major  way on the yield,  dry matter  
concentration,  digestibility,  preservation  and unit cost of silage. Consequently,  
there is a clear  limit  on the extent  of the control  that can be exercised  over the 
weather-induced  variability,  and the flexibility  of reducing  variation  will there ­
fore depend  on the ability  to react or respond  quickly  and with flexibility  to 
particular  circumstances  that arise due to weather.  This ability  to respond  is 
often  difficult  to achieve,  especially  if it is remembered  over 80% of silage  is 
harvested  by contractors.
(i) Silage  yield  . .
The following  factors  are important  in reducing  variability  in silage  yield.
• Perennial  ryegrass  swards  can be managed  to produce  more  consistent  yields  
than other grasses.  Mid and late season  cultivars  will give less variable
second  cuts than early cultivars.
• To assist achieving  consistent  yields,  soil analysis  each 5 years should  be 
used to determine  the P, K and lime status  of the silage  fields. Appropriate  
fertiliser  inputs  should  be based on these results,  together  with replacing  
what the crop removed  and what was supplied  by slurry. Maintenance  of 
high fertility  is important  as it leads to less fluctuation  in yield from year to
year.
• Nitrogen  fertiliser  should  be applied  as early as possible,  ground  conditions  
and weather  permitting.  In many  cases  where  silage  ground  is not grazed  m 
Spring,  N can be applied  in early  March.  In all cases,  at least  6 weeks  should  
elapse  between  spreading  N and harvesting.  On many  lighter  soils, sulphur  
should  be applied  for second-cut  silage.
• Slurry  spreading  should  be completed  by mid March  for first cut silage  and 
should  not be applied  to high  grass. It should  only  be applied  to bare  stubble  
for regrowths  (rates  dealt with later).
• Assuming  that soil fertility,  structure  drainage  and nutrient  supply  are satis ­
factory,  the yield  of a particular  sward  is substantially  dependent  on weather. 
At that stage,  the main  mechanism  tor achieving  a given  yield is by altering  
the harvesting  date. However,  delaying  harvesting  date to increase  yield is
207
normally  accompanied  by a decrease  in digestibility.  The correct  balance  
between  yield  and quality  will depend,  among  other  factors,  on the type  and 
intensity  of enterprise  on the farm and the relative  costs of forage,  concen ­
trates  and animal  product.  However,  relative  variability  in dry matter  yield 
can often be reduced  by harvesting  the first-cut  in the final week of May 
rather  than in mid May. Variable  yields  usually  occur  in July/August  har­
vests,  and on farms  that are prone  to severe  drought  this may be an insur ­
mountable  problem.
• Grass  dry matter  concentrations  at harvesting  impact  on the fresh yields,  as 
well as on effluent  losses  and the ease of preservation.  The progression  in 
grass dry matter  concentration  from 200 g DM/kg  to 180, 150 and 120 g 
DM/kg  reflects  the effects  of dew, a heavy  rain shower  and several  days 
rain, respectively,  and would  increase  the fresh  yield at a 25 t/ha crop to 28, 
33 and 42 t/ha, respectively.
(ii) Digestibility
As silage  digestibility  increases  cattle  eat more  of it, utilise  it more  efficiently  
and produce  correspondingly  more meat or milk. Farmers  who want to pro­
duce highly  digestible  silage  on a reliable  basis should  incorporate  the follow ­
ing into their management  system.
(a) Use ryegrass  swards.  This is a long-term  investment  and, provided  the 
cultivars  in the seed-mix  have  fairly  similar  heading-out  dates,  makes iden­
tifying  the optimum  target  harvest  date straightforward.
(b) Harvest  the crop when seedheads  are beginning  to emerge  from the grass  
(do not wait until seed-heads  have  fully  emerged).  This is the grass  growth  
stage  that tends  to give the best balance  between  yield  and quality for  farmers  
seeking  high levels  of animal  production.
(c) Ensure  there is not an accumulation  of dead or old stemmy  vegetation  at 
the base  of the crop. This  can readily  happen  where  swards  were not  grazed  
bare in autumn  or where  considerable  winter  growth  occurred.  The effect  
of thus accumulating  what  by silage-harvesting  date will be old, low qual­
ity herbage  at the base of the crop could be to decrease  grass DMD at 
harvest  from 750 to 690 g/kg.
(d) Have  sufficient  flexibility  to be able to alter the harvesting  date, if neces ­
sary. For example,  if high yielding  lush crops are subjected  to heavy  rain 
and strong winds they can lodge and lie on the ground  under very wet 
conditions.  If this occurs,  the normal  rate of decrease  in digestibility  can 
triple,  leading  to up to a 10% unit drop  in DMD  in a week.  Such  crops  need 
to be harvested  quickly  after lodging  if such large  drops  in DMD  are to be 
avoided.  However,  the risk of lodging  is reduced  where  excessive  rate of 
total nitrogen-applications  (including  slurry)  are avoided.
(Hi) Preservation
The major  aims in preserving  grass as silage  are to store  the grass in a genu ­
inely air-free  environment  and to then inhibit  the activity  within  the silo (or 
bale) of undesirable  microbes.  This means  fast filling  and perfect  sealing  of
208
silos,  ensiling  clean  grass  that is free  of contamination  and, if necessary,  further  
facilitating  preservation  by wilting,  using  additives  or using  other  management  
practices  that encourage  good preservation  by producing  “easy to preserve ” 
crops. The following  are the main guidelines:
(a) Use ryegrass  swards.  This long-term  investment  produces  crops  of higher  
sugar  concentration  that are easier  to preserve  than other  grasses.
(b) Complete  slurry-spreading  by mid March,  with undiluted  cattle  slurry  be­
ing evenly  spread  on short  grass at not more  than 33 t/ha (3000  gal/ac.)  - 
spread  again  immediately  after the first-cut  is 17 t/ha (1500  gal/ac.).
(c) In a two-cut  silage  system,  apply  N fertiliser  as early as practicable,  using  
rates of 110 to 140 kg N/ha (90 to 110 units N/ac)  and 75 to 100 kg N/ha  
(60 to 80 units N/ac) for first and second  cuts, respectively.  In some cir­
cumstances  higher  rates may be justified.  Reduce  the above  fertiliser  N 
rates by 1.1 to 1.8 kg N/t undiluted  cattle  slurry  (i.e. 10 to 15 units  N/lOOO  
gallons)  applied  in February/March.  The corresponding  adjustments  for 
slurry  applied  after the first-cut  are 0 to 1.1 kg N/t slurry.
(d) Only apply  lime to silage  land before  March  or after the silage-harvesting  
season  is completed  (i.e. do not apply  to crops  actually  growing  for silage.
(e) Wilting  has both advantages  and disadvantages.  It should  only be consid ­
ered when drying  conditions  are good, and should  not be attempted  in 
large narrow  rows. Ideally,  if a farmer  wants  to wilt, the grass should  be 
fully tedded  and given complete  ground-cover.  At a minimum,  where  a 
large  mower  conditioner  is being  used,  the gates  at the back of the mower  
should  be opened  wide  to allow  the grass  be spread  in wide rows. If wilt­
ing, aim at a target  of 250 to 300 g DM/kg  (i.e. 25% to 30% DM), to be 
achieved  within  24 hours  of mowing.  Besides  its obvious  effects  on efflu ­
ent production,  successful  wilting  will virtually  ensure  good  preservation,  
but the improved  intake  of dry matter  is not correspondingly  converted  to 
additional  animal  product.
(f) Additives  can be beneficial  in some circumstances,  but must be chosen  
carefully  and appropriately,  and applied  properly,  if an economic  response  
to their  use is to be obtained.  Where  grass  is harvested  at an advanced  state  
of maturity  (i.e. very stemmy)  or has been heavily  wilted,  conventional  
additives  are not normally  justified.  On the other  hand, if leafy crops  of 
grass that have received  none or a little wilting  are being  ensiled,  the fol­
lowing  three steps should  be followed:
(i) obtain  an estimate  of grass ensilability.  At a minimum  this involves  
measuring  grass sugar  concentration (expressed as a proportion of grass  
juice)  and preferably  also buffering  capacity.  Sugars  can be measured  
on farms,  while  both sugars  and buffering  capacity  can be measured  
on samples  submitted  to laboratories.  It is critical  that the samples  
taken propely  represent  the grass to be harvested,  and that they are 
properly  processed  prior to analysis.  Based  on an ensilability  index,  
the category  of additive  required,  as well as the appropriate  applica ­
tion rate, will be indicated.
209
(g)(ii) make  an estimate  of the fresh  yield  being  harvested.  This is necessary  
since the additive  will be applied  per tonne  of weight  harvested,  and 
cannot  accurately  be assessed  without  weighing  a strip or trailer-load  
of grass.  Doing  this is time well  spent  as a 40% underestimation  of the 
actual yield of grass would lead to applying  40% too little 
additive  and consequently  obtaining  an inferior  return  on the invest ­
ment  in the additive.
(iii) evenly  apply adequate  sugar or acid based additives  where grass  
ensilability  is difficult,  and effective  inoculants  where  ensiling  condi ­
tions are very good. However,  the recent  major  drop in beef prices  
now puts the economic  merit of inoculant  additives  under  consider ­
able doubt  on cattle  farms.
Fast filling  and perfect  sealing  of the silos (or bales). This is crucial  and 
the single  most important  factor  in achieving  good preservation.
(iv) Aerobic  deterioration
The three main factors  affecting  aerobic  deterioration  once silos are opened  
are (1) management,  (2) weather,  (3) silage  characteristics.  Of these,  manage ­
ment  is the most  important  factor. The aim of management  practices  must  be to 
minimise  the contact  time between  silage  and air. In bunker  silos,  this involves  
(a) moving  through  the silage  face quickly,  (b) presenting  easy-fed  animals  
with only so much  silage  as they can eat in a day, (c) keeping  the silage  face as 
undisturbed  as possible.  Rough  or careless  removal  of silage  from  the silo leaves 
behind  a tattered  and tossed  face into which  air can penetrate  deeply,  (d) keep ­
ing polythene  on top of the pit fully weighted  down  and taut to the front  of the 
silo and (e) not covering  the silage  face with polythene  at feeding  time as this 
creates  a mushroom-house  environment.  Unfortunately  there are no chemicals  
available  to spray  on the silage  face at feedout  to prevent  aerobic  deterioration  
at and behind  the face.
All else being  equal,  slower  filling  of a silo is likely  to make  the silage  more 
prone  to aerobic  deterioration  at feeding  time.
With regard  to weather,  it has been shown in Grange  experiments  that warmer  
weather  at feedout  increases  the susceptibility  of silage to aerobic  deteriora ­
tion. The management  recommendations  already described  are crucially  
important  during  periods  of mild weather  as deterioration  is more  extensive  in 
such conditions.
Certain  silage  characteristics  such as the degree  of stemminess  or dryness  of 
silage  or its density  may influence  susceptibility  to aerobic  deterioration.  As 
demonstrated  in the Grange  experiments,  the major  chemical  components  in 
well preserved  silages  exert relatively  little impact  on aerobic  stability.  How ­
ever, other experiments  have demonstrated  that small amounts  of as yet 
unidentified  chemicals  are formed  in some  silages  and do improve  aerobic  sta­
bility.  The microbial  composition  of silage  when  exposed  to air and in particu ­
lar yeast numbers,  has a major  effect  on aerobic  stability.  The factors  which 
influence  this still need to be defined.
210
4. FUTURE  POTENTIAL
Irish grassland  has the potential  to support  highly  efficient  beef production,  
and allow  a competitive  advantage  over  beef  producers  in other  countries.  Tak­
ing grass yield, quality  and efficiency  values  under  a current  good-manage ­
ment  system  for a geographical  location  such as Grange,  carcass  output  per ha 
grass can be estimated  at 553 kg per year. There  exists  a realistic  potential,  as 
shown  in Table  22, to radically  increase  the efficiency  of producing  beef per 
hectare  of grassland  by increasing  grass  production,  increasing  the proportion  
consumed  by grazing  rather  than after conserving,  and improving  quality  and 
efficiency  of utilisation,  to produce  almost  1000 kg carcass/ha  each year.
Strategies  for achieving  such an enormous  improvement  in productivity  will 
depend  on the adoption  of improved  technologies,  intensive  monitoring  allied  
to the prompt  use of accurate,  quantified  information  for decision-making  and 
the operation  of newer  production  systems  incorporating  both flexibility  and 
continuous,  active  management.
Critical to  improving  the annual yield  of grass are maintaining good  soil drain ­
age, structure  (i.e. prevent  compaction)  and fertility  (P, K, lime and micro ­
nutrients).  Improved  grass  varieties  (and possibly  grasses  selected  specifically  
for grazing  or conserving),  together  with high rates of N application  spread  in a 
time-critical  pattern  throughout  the year and the use of variable  length  grazing  
cycles  to provide  optimal  regrowth  recovery  intervals,  will be central  to deliv ­
ering  the high yields. Alternatively,  some  clover-based  systems  will offer  the 
potential  to increase  beef output  per forage  hectare  compared  to the current  
standards,  but probably  not as much  as proposed  in Table  22.
Considerable  scope  exists  to increase the proportion  of annual  grass  DM pro­
duction  consumed  by grazing,  and correspondingly  reduce  the proportion  con­
served,  by operating  systems  involving  as early a turnout  to grass and as late a

removal  from grass  as possible,  staggered  turnout  and removal,  and a manipu ­
lation  of the seasonal  grass supply  pattern  based  on the cultivars  used and the 
strategic  seasonal  pattern  of N fertiliser  use. Furthermore,  the feeding  of some  
of the supplementary  concentrates  at grass  that would  otherwise  have  been sub­
sequently  fed indoors,  will allow the finishing  of cattle off of grass, with the 
consequent  reduction  in winter  forage  requirements.
Improvements  in the efficiency  with which  cattle consume  the grass pro­
duced  will depend  on the use of rotational  grazing  systems  involving  paddocks.  
Selection  of grasses  on the basis  of their  palatability  and intake  characteristics,  
together  with more  frequent  (and possibly  semi-automated)  allocation  of fresh  
grass  supplies  during  the day, will be necessary.  Critical  also however,  will be 
a more  comprehensive  knowledge  of grass  growth  rates,  actual  supplies  avail ­
able, grazing  rate and animal  behaviour.  Considerable  scope still exists to 
reduce  conservation  losses,  and will hinge primarily  on reducing  losses via 
effluent  (e.g. feeding  effluent  essentially  eliminates  this loss completely)  and 
restricting  aerobic  deterioration  at filling,  during  storage  and at feedout.  The 
scope  to reduce  losses  during  fermentation  appears  more limited  at present.
Relatively  little opportunity  seems  available  to improve  the nutritive  value 
(e.g. DMD)  of grazed  grass in a situation  where  the aim is to increase  grazing  
efficiency  markedly.  However,  the use of ryegrass  actively  selected  for higher  
DMD,  quite  possibly  of late heading-out  date, together  with a greater  extent  of 
control  on aerobic  deterioration  of silage  at feedout,  should  readily  achieve  the 
improvements  suggested  in Table  22.
5. FINAL  COMMENT
The optimal,  rigorous  management  of Irish grassland  is the route  to a viable  
ruminant  livestock  industry in the future, assuming  we will have to 
operate  in a progressively  more open economic  market-place  but where  there  
will be greater  regulations  regarding  food quality,  animal  welfare  and environ ­
mental  considerations.  Fundamental  to Irelands  ability  to take full advantage  
of the opportunities  provided  by our grassland  is a national,  co-ordinated,  
focussed,  comprehensive  and fundamental  research  effort  to understand  grass  
production,  consumption  and conversion  to quality  beef  - we must pursue  the 
science  of grass  and beef.
This technology  must be quickly  transferred  to beef farmers  in the form of 
flexible,  adaptable  systems  (not blueprints)  and management  support  mecha ­
nisms (that will permit  prompt  and appropriate  decisions  based on accurate  
knowledge)  so they can cash-in  on grass.

RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  SWARD  HEIGHT  AND  HERBAGE  YIELD
The use of POST  GRAZING  sward  surface  height  as a grassland  manage ­
ment  aid has been advocated  for a number  of years. However,  the use of PRE ­
GRAZING  sward surface  height  as an estimater  of the HERBAGE  YIELD  
available  for grazing  animals  has not been widely  used in Ireland.  Where  pre­
grazing  sward  height  is being  used,  tables  which  relate  sward  height  to herbage  
yield are those  derived  in other  countries.  During  the past 3-years,  research  at 
Grange  has examined  the relationship  between  pre-grazing  sward surface  height  
and herbage  DRY  MATTER  yields.  Over  this period  close to 3,000  plots had 
both their height  recorded  and actual  yields  determined,  and these height  and 
yield data have been used to.generate  IRISH  height  to yield conversion  tables.  
This article  outlines  the main results  of this research.
WHY  USE  PRE-GRAZING  SWARD  HEIGHT?
The pre-grazing  sward  height  can be used as a grassland  management  tool, 
helping  the grassland  manager  become  familiar  with  herbage  yield  and thereby  
facilitating  a process  where  animals  may be offered  “known ” herbage  allow ­
ances.
MEASURING  SWARD  SURFACE  HEIGHT
Sward  surface  height  (i.e. the height  of the grass)  may be measured m a number
of ways.
213
1. Ruler
The simplest  means  of measuring  sward  .height  is with a ruler,  where  a ruler  
is inserted  vertically  into  the standing  crop  and the height  from the ground  to 
the “top” of the sward  is then measured.  However,  big variation  can emerge  
in deciding  what is the “top” of the sward.
2. Sward  Stick
A sward  stick consists  of a graduated  metal rod (with marks  each 0.5 cm) 
fitted with a perspex  arm. The sward stick is inserted  vertically  into the 
sward  and the perspex  arm is lowered  until it comes  in contact  with a leaf. 
The reading  on the shaft is taken  as the sward  height.  Both ruler and sward 
stick  are somewhat  slow to use, especially  if large areas  are to be measured,  
and many  readings  are needed.  Readings  are manually  recorded.
3. Plate meter
Sward  height  can be measured  with a plate meter,  of which  there are many 
types. In general,  a plate  is allowed  to settle  on and compress  the sward,  the 
height  between  the ground  and the plate  being  measured  as the sward height. 
Readings  may need  some  degree  of manual recording,  but considerable  scope  
exists  to automate  and streamline  this process.
4. Other  techniques  that for example  bounce  light  or sound  waves  off the sward 
have also been investigated,  with varying  degrees  of success.
The use of plate  meters  is becoming  more common  and some  are now being 
manufactured  in Ireland.
SWARD  STICK
At the lower  sward  heights  (4-6 cm) the sward  stick resulted  in height  values 
which were 1 to 2 cm GREATER  than those from the AFT meter. In taller  
swards  this difference  between  the two approaches  to measurement  was in­
creased  and, as a result  of these large  differences,  yields  based on uncompressed  
sward height  CANNOT  be read from Table 1 and therefore  the sward stick  
needs  to have its own conversion  tables  developed.
CHARACTERISTICS  OF PLATE  METER
As plate meters  measure  compressed  sward  height,  the heavier  the plate the 
greater  the degree  of sward  compression and the lower  the resulting  sward  height.  
Thus, various  meters  need to be standardised  so that each meter  results  in the 
same degree  of sward compression  and height. The plate meter  used in the 
present  experiment  was developed  by An Foras  Taluntais  (AFT)  in the early 
1980 ’s and consisted  of a 30 cm diameter  plate which  places  a force  of 2.8 kg/ 
m^ on the sward. The meter  was designed  to automatically  record  the sward  
height  and calculate  the average  height  for a large number  of readings  and dis­
play the results  on a LCD panel.
HEIGHT/YIELD  RELATIONSHIP
Table I shows  a range  of sward  heights  and the corresponding  measured  dry 
matter  yields. The swards  used were  generally  at the end of a 3-week  rotation.  
The data in the Table  are based  on almost  3,0(X)  plots where  height  and yields  
were actually  measured.  Eleven  different  swards  were measured  over  the three  
full growing  seasons  during  the course  of the Grange  study. While  height  was
214
measured  from the ground  to the plate, the yield (in kg DRY MATTER  per 
hectare)  was measured  in the grazing  horizon  above  a stubble  of 4 cm (not to 
ground  level).
Table 1 covers  sward  surface  heights  within  the range 6 to 25 cm, that is, 
within  the limits  of “normal ” PRE-GRAZING  conditions.  At heights  greater  
than 25 cm, the height  to yield  relationships  are much  less accurate  because  the 
sward  tends  to fall over and lodge  under  the weight  of the plate.  Consequently,  
the values  in Table 1 should  not be extended  for use on silage  swards.
The relationship  between  sward  surface  height  and herbage  dry matter  yield  
DOES  VARY  from sward  to sward  (i.e. one crop (field)  to the next) and also 
varies  with season. Thus,  for example,  stemmy  swards  give a higher  height  
reading  as the plate is supported  on the stems. Measurement  taken on lush 
pastures  after  heavy  rainfalls  or in frosty  conditions  will also be associated  with  
errors. The way the meter  is lowered  into the sward  has an effect  on height.  
Dropping  the plate meter  with force onto the sward  will compress  the sward  
surface  to a greater  extent  than doing  the procedure  gently. When  measuring  
sward height,  the more readings  that are taken the closer  the average  height  
value will be to tbe true field value. Aim to take at least 50 readings  per pad- 
dock.
USE OF THE TABLE
Table 1 has five columns.  The FIRST  column  is the compressed  sward  
surface  height  measured  in centimetres.  The SECOND  column  relates  sward  
surface  height  to HERBAGE  DRY  MATTER  yields  (in kg DM/ha)  in the early  
part of the season  and spans the Spring/Summer  period  from the start of the 
growing  season  to mid-June.  This is the stage when grass swards  are in their  
reproductive  growth  phase  (after  the winter).  The THIRD  column  covers  the 
height  to yield relationship  for the period  mid-June  to late August,  when,  de­
pending  on management,  sward  quality  can vary widely  and some  grasses  will 
tend to form seed heads. The FOURTH  column  covers  the remainder  of the 
year to late October/early  November  when  grasses  are in the vegetative  stage.  
The FIFTH  column,  gives  an overall  yield value  for the whole  season  for each  
of the sward  heights.
NOTE  that the yields  given in Table 1 are the AVERAGE  values  for each 
sward  height  over the range of swards  used in the study. There  IS variation  
from one sward  to the  next. The analysis  of the Grange  data relating  height  and 
yield  show  that at any sward  height  DRY  MATTER  YIELD  may vary by PLUS  
or MINUS  500 kg DM/ha  from the value  predicted  in Table 1. THUS,  VAL ­
UES IN THE TABLE  CAN ONLY  BE USED  AS AN INDICATOR  OF 
YIELD  AND  NOT  THE  “ACTUAL ” YIELD  AT ANY  SWARD  HEIGHT.
USING  THE  TABLE  UNDER  FIELD  CONDITIONS
If the average  pre-grazing  sward  height  is 12 to 15 cm then herbage  on offer  
is equivalent  to approximately  1600  to 2100  kg DM/ha.  At a herbage  availabil ­
ity 2000  kg DM/ha  and offering  dairy  cows  a herbage  allowance  of 20 kg DM/  
head/day,  there are 100 grazing  days per hectare  (40 grazing  days/acre).  Like ­
wise,  if 15 kg DM/head/day  is being  offered  suckler  cows  or drystock,  there  are 
the equivalent  of 133 grazing  days/ha  (or 54 grazing  day.sMc)  on offer. If pre­
grazing sward  height  is 18 to 20 cm, then herbage  on offer  is equivalent  to 2600
215
to 3000  kg DM/ha.  Herbage  yields  of greater  than approximately  3500 kg DM/  
ha or a pre-grazing  sward  height  of 23 to 24 cm, is probably  indicative  of sur­
plus grass.
If grass allowances  are offered  on the basis of sward height,  the actual 
allowance  may be at most  plus or minus 1 kg DM/head/day  from the expected  
allowance  for cattle. Consistency  in measurement  is important  if the operator ’s 
eye is to be trained  in assessing  herbage  yield  and thus be an effective  judge  in 
estimating  herbage  availability.  As mentioned  previously,  the main benefit  of 
correctly  using the plate meter is to train the grassland  managers  eye into 
assessing  herbage  yield  in the standing  crop. AS A “GENERAL ” RULE  EACH  
CENTIMETER  RISE  IN COMPRESSED  SWARD  HEIGHT  WILL  REPRE ­
SENT  AN INCREASE  IN YIELD  OF 150 TO 200 KG DM/HA.
OTHER  PLATE  METERS
The AFT  meter  has been compared  with a second  plate meter,  manufactured  
in Cork. The Cork meter  consisted  of a 32 x 32 cm, 11/2 mm, stainless  steel 
plate  which exerts  a compressing  force  of 5.4 kg/m2  on the sward  (nearly twice  
the force  of the AFT meter). The Cork meter  being  heavier  resulted  in sward 
heights  which  were  lower  (10%)  than  the AFT  meter. However,  as the percent ­
age difference  was relatively  small, the error associated  will be of little 
practical  consequence  and the Cork meter  may be used to record  sward  height  
and read from the herbage  yield values  in Table 1.
The plate on the Cork meter  is carried  on a central  shaft and as the meter  is 
lowered  into the sward  the plate rises on the shaft which  is notched  at 0.5 cm 
intervals.  A counter  with a sprocket  wheel  counts  the notches  as the plate  rises 
(not as the plate falls as it is removed  from the sward).  The number  of height  
readings  taken is recorded  on a second  hand operated  counter.  Using  the read­
ing on the shaft  counter  and the number  of individual  height  readings  taken,  the 
average  sward  surface  height  and herbage  yield can be calculated.
If the Cork  meter  is to be used to estimate  sward height  and thus herbage  DM 
yield  from Table 1, the following  procedure  should  take place.
1)
2)
3)Record  the starting  reading  on the shaft  recorder. 
Record  the final reading  on the shaft recorder. 
Record  the number  of height  readings  taken.
Then use the following  formula  to get the sward  height  (in cm):
Sward  height  (cm) = [Final  reading]  minus  [starting  reading]
[number  readings  taken x 2]
Example  1: 10 height  readings  taken,  starting  value  = 17,096  
and final value  = 17,568
height  (cm) = [17,568-17,096]  = 472
[10x2]  20
25 height  readings  taken,  starting  value  = 19,000  
final value  = 19,250= 23.6 cm
Example  2:
height  (cm) =[19,250-19,000]mYj ]—
216250 =
505 cm
SUMMARY
* Sward  height  is a useful  management  aid and is a help in training  the “eye” 
to herbage  supply.
* Sward  height  and pasture  dry matter  yield available  for grazing  are related,  
but the relationship  varies  with pasture  type and season.
* The Grange  Table can be used  as a guideline  for farmers  who want  to relate  
sward  height  to herbage  dry matter  yield.
* Not all means of measuring  pasture  height - are directly  comparable.  
Different  conversion  tables  are needed  for each instrument.NOTE that these  height  readings  will be some 10% lower  than those  taken  with
the AFT  meter. The mathematical  process  above  is not necessary  with the AFT
meter,  as all calculations  are carried  out automatically.

INTRODUCTION
Unlike  improvements  in feeding  and management  which  have  ongoing  costs  
associated  with them,  genetic  improvement  is permanent  and is largely  free of 
on-going  costs.  Furthermore,  genetic  improvements  do not have the negative  
connotations  which  often accompany  feeding  and management  improvements  
(e.g. hormones  and feed additives,  environmental  risks  from  excessive  nutrient  
loads as fertiliser  or as slurry,  animal  welfare  considerations  of confinement  
and housing).  With the increasing  competitiveness  of the other livestock  sec­
tors such as pigs and poultry,  the Irish beef industry  must improve  and exploit  
genetic  potential  to the maximum.  Otherwise  it will become  even  more uncom ­
petitive  relative  to the pig and poultry  meat industries  than at present.  Further ­
more,  it could  also fall behind  its international  competitors  in beef production  
whose  breeding  programmes  are already  well advanced.  There  are two compo ­
nents  to the production  of animals  of high genetic  quality  (1) identification  and 
production  of genetically  superior  breeding  stock and (2) exploitation  of this 
genetically  superior  breeding  stock through  their widespread  use within  the 
industry.  The first requires  comprehensive  breeding  programmes  while the 
second  requires  the use by commercial  producers  of the genetically  superior  
animals  produced  from the breeding  programmes.
IMPROVING  GENETIC  MERIT
Improvement  of genetic  merit involves  the identification  and selection  ot 
genetically  superior  animals  in structured  breeding  programmes.  The perform ­
ance of an animal  is a function  of its genotype  and environment.  There  have 
been considerable  improvements  in environmental  factors  such as nutrition,  
disease  control  and housing  but these are not passed  on from generation  to 
generation  and generally  require  ongoing  costs in order  to be maintained.  The 
genotype  of the animal  on the other  hand  is the genetic  material  it inherits  from 
its parents,  half of which  is passed  on from generation  to generation.  To bring  
about genetic  improvement,  it is necessary  to separate  out the proportion  of 
performance  (growth,  carcass  traits, feed efficiency  etc.) which  is due to the 
genes  it carries  (genotype)  and then select  for the desired  traits.
ESTIMATED  BREEDING  VALUES  (EBVs)
Since  true breeding  value  cannot  be measured,  estimates  of it are made.
Sire: In the past the estimation  of breeding  value  was done by the contempo ­
rary comparison  method  having corrected  for environmental  effects  such as sex
218
and age of dam. However,  contemporary  comparison  was only applicable  to 
animals  reared  under  the same  conditions  and as pedigree  herds  are generally  
small,  relatively  few breeding  values  could  be calculated  and/or  their  accuracy  
was low.
The development  of BLUP  (best linear  unbiassed  prediction)  has overcome  
the major  limitations  of contemporary  comparison.  This technique  uses all the 
records  available  on an animal  and on all its relatives,  to partition  the genetic  
and environmental  effects  and give a more  reliable  EBV. Genetic  linkages  be­
tween  herds  allow evaluations  to be made across herds.  BLUP  can also account  
for associations  between  traits which further improves  its accuracy.  For 
example  200 day weight  is positively  associated  with 400 day weight.  EBVs  
are expressed  in the units in which  they are measured  (e.g. weights  in kg, mus­
cle scores  in points)  and relative  to the breed  average  for a specified  year. EBV  
is an estimate  of the genetic  merit  of the animal  itself  but only half of this is 
passed  on to the progeny.  It is expected  that EBVs  for Irish  pedigree  beef  bulls  
will be available  shortly.
Dam EBV: The performance  of a calf is also influenced  by the genetic  
maternal  and milk production  traits of its dam. BLUP  can separate  out these  
and thus produce  EBVs  for dams similar  to those for sires. The maternal  ge­
netic traits  will be passed  on to the progeny  of both sexes  but of course  they can 
only be expressed  by the female  progeny.  Of particular  interest  is the genetic  
potential  of the dam for milk production,  a major  factor  determining  calf  wean ­
ing weight.  In beef  breeds  this EBV is designated  200-day  milk.
IRISH  BREEDING  PROGRAMME
The main elements  of a structured  breeding  programme  are outlined  in 
Figure  1. They are (1) on-farm  weight  recording  in pedigree  herds,  (2) central  
performance  testing  of young  bulls,  (3) central  progeny  testing  of bulls,  and (4) 
importation  of genetically  superior  breeding  stock as live animals,  semen  or 
embryos.  All these elements  are used in the Irish cattle breeding  programme  
which  has been described  in detail by Grogan  (1992).  Up until now the Irish 
programme  has been operated  by the Department  of Agriculture,  Food  and For­
estry in cooperation  with the breed  societies  and the Al stations.  At present,  a 
national cattle  breeding  authority  is being  established  to take over  the control  of 
cattle  breeding.  In Ireland,  beef bull proofs  are expressed  as relative  breeding  
values  (RBVs)  with the breed  mean  = 100. The RBV  for a trait is an estimate  of 
the bull’s genetic  merit  for that trait relative  to an average  bull of the breed. The 
superiority/inferiority  of a bull is indicated  by the extent to which  his RBV  
deviates  from 100. Bulls  of 110 or greater  are from the top 15% of the breed  
population  while  bulls  of 90 or less are from the bottom  15% of the breed.  One 
half of a bull’s superiority  or inferiority  is passed  on to his progeny.  RBVs  are 
reported  separately  for growth  rate, carcass  conformation  and carcass  leanness,  
and feed  efficiency values are available  for some  performance  tested  bulls.  From  
these an overall  beef merit index is calculated.  This combines  the individual  
trait values  into a single  index  of economic  worth.  Al bulls are also surveyed  
for calving  ease,  calf mortality  to 48  hours  and gestation  length.  The results  are 
expressed  as the expected  levels  for matings  to Friesian  cows.
219
Fig. 1 Illustration  of genetic  improvement  programme  for beef  cattle  breeds
The relevant  genetic  data needed by the users of Al are published  each spring  
in the Approved  Al Beef  and Dairy  Bull Lists.  Approved  beef  bulls are catego ­
rised as approved  for widespread  use (W) or approved  for limited  use (T). The 
W category  are high genetic  merit bulls which  have been progeny  tested  and 
surveyed  for ease of calving  and for which  semen  is readily  available.  T bulls 
have good performance  test and/or  ease of calving  ratings  and are undergoing  
progeny  test.
GENETIC  PROGRESS
An important  measure  of the success  of a breeding  programme  is the rate of 
genetic  improvement  over time. In dairying  for example,  the rate of genetic  
progress  in milk fat and protein  yields  has almost  trebled  (0.4%  to 1.1% per 
year)  for sires born over  the 10 year  period  1980-1990  (Dillon.  Crosse,  Buckley  
and Flynn,  1996).  There  are no published  estimates  of the changes  in beef  breed 
mean values  over time but some indication  of genetic  change  can be deduced  
from the ratings  of the bulls entering  the Approved  Bull List compared  with 
those  of the bulls leaving  it.
220
Growth  rate: The mean growth  rate RBVs  for the Charolais,  Hereford,  
Limousin  and Simmental  bulls  approved  for widespread  use in 1991 and 1996  
are shown  in Table  I. Also shown  are the RBVs  for the bulls included  in the list 
in 1991 but since  removed,  and the new bulls  added  to the list in 1996.  In 1991 
there were  only 5 Charolais  approved  for widespread  use and they had a mean 
growth  rate RBV of 107. Since  then, 4 of these (mean  growth  rate RBV 106) 
have been  removed  from the list. By 1996 there  were 14 Charolais  bulls  (mean  
RBV for growth  rate of 110) approved  for widespread  use. Only  one new bull 
was added to the list in 1996  and he had an RBV  for growth  of 115. Thus,  there  
is evidence  of some  improvement  (107 to 110) in the genetic  merit  for growth  
rate of the approved  Al Charolais  bulls from 1991 to 1996. However,  this 
improvement  only brought  the mean of the Charolais  bulls into line with that of 
the other  breeds.

In 1991 there were 22 Hereford  bulls with a mean growth  RBV of 109 
approved  for widespread  use. Since  then 14 of them  (also with a mean  growth  
RBV  of 109) have  been  dropped  from  the list. By 1996 there  were 16 Hereford  
bulls approved  for widespread  use. Their  mean growth  rate RBV of 110 was 
little different  from the 1991 value.  The 7 new bulls added  in 1996 also had a 
mean growth  RBV of 110. Thus, there has been little change  in the growth  
RBV of approved  Hereford  bulls over the past 5 years so the only change  in 
genetic  merit  of approved  Al Hereford  bulls is that which  has occurred  in the 
breed  mean.
For the Limousin  and Simmental  breeds,  mean growth  RBV for approved  
bulls was in fact one point  lower  in 1996 than in 1991.  In both breeds  also, the 
bulls  dropped  from  the list were  3 points  below  the list mean  suggesting  that to 
some degree  it was the poorer  bulls which  were dropped.  However,  it is also 
true for both breeds  that the bulls added  to the list were below  the list mean.
Generally,  there is little to suggest  that there has been any significant  
increase  in RBV  for growth  rate over tbe last 5 years  in the approved  Al bulls.  
There  is little difference  between  the breeds  in the growth  RBVs  of the bulls  
approved  for widespread  use. Therefore,  the only improvement  in genetic  merit  
of Al bulls  has been that which has occurred  in the breed  means  (of which  there  
are no published  estimates).
221
Calving  ease:  It might  be argued that improvement  in growth  RBV  was con­
strained  by selection  for ease of calving.  The mean calving  difficulty  scores  for 
1991 and 1996 for the Charolais,  Hereford,  Limousin  and Simmental  breeds  
are shown  in Table 2. Mean calving  difficulty  score for Charolais  actually  
increased  (4.1 to 5.7) from 1991 to 1996 but most of this was due to a single  
bull with a high calving  difficulty  (19.8%)  which  was added  to the  list in 1996.  
For all the other  breeds  there was little change  in mean calving  difficulty  per­
centage  between  1991 and 1996.

EXPLOITING  GENETIC  POTENTIAL
At producer  level, genetic  improvement  comes  mainly  from the widespread  
use of genetically  superior  sires. This is discussed  under  two headings  (1) the 
mean  differences  between  beef  breeds  and (2) the genetic  differences  between  
sires within  a breed.  In addition  to the  genetic  merit  of the sire, breed  type  of the 
suckler  dam is also considered.
DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN  SIRE  BREEDS
The relative  merits  of the different  beef sire breeds  have been well docu ­
mented  and are summarised  in Table 3. Other  than the Angus  which had a lower  
value,  slaughter  weight  for age differed  little between  Friesian,  Hereford,  MRI, 
Limousin  and Blonde,  while  Simmental,  Belgian  Blue and Charolais  were 4- 
7% superior  to these. All beef  crosses  had higher  kill-out  values  than Friesians  
with the continentals  having  higher  values  than the British  breeds.  Hereford,  
MRI and Limousin  were 4%-5%  superior  to Friesians  and Angus  in carcass  
weight  for age while  the other breeds  were 8%-l  1% superior.  Muscle  weight  
for age was similar  for Friesian  and Hereford  even though  the latter had 4% 
more carcass.  All continentals  produced  11%-19%  more muscle  than Friesian  
and Hereford  with the Belgian  Blue having  the highest  production  of muscle. 
Muscle  size essentially  paralleled  muscle  weight  for age. There  was relatively  
little difference  across  breeds  in the proportion  of higher  value muscle  which  
was identical  for the dairy and British  breeds  and was 2%-3%  higher  for the 
continentals.  All beef crosses  had considerably  superior  conformation  to
222
Friesians.  Limousin,  Belgian  Blue and Charolais  had the best conformation.  
Fat score was considerably  higher  for the British  breeds  than for the dairy and 
continental  breeds.  There was little difference  in fat score betvveen  Friesian,  
MRI, Limousin  and Simmental,  but Blonde  d’Aquitaine,  Belgian  Blue and 
Charolais  had lower  fat scores  than the others.

DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN  SIRES  WITHIN  A BREED
The mean productivity  differences  between  the breeds  described  above  are 
now widely  appreciated  by producers  and there  has been a large  change  in beef 
breed usage  from predominantly  British  breeds  10-15 years ago to predomi ­
nantly  continental  beef breeds  at present.  This change  has been accompanied  
nationally  by a marked  increase  in mean  carcass  weight  and an improvement  in 
carcass  traits. The next major  improvement  in productivity  must now come  
from the identification  and widespread  use of genetically  superior  bulls within  
each breed.  For some  traits,  the difference  between  bulls  of the same  breed  can 
be as great  as the mean  differences  between  breeds.  The Al bulls approved  for 
widespread  use are on average  11% (Angus),  8% (Belgian  Blue), 10% 
(Charolais),  10% (Hereford),  8% (Limousin)  and 9% (Simmental)  above  their  
respective  breed  means  for growth  rate. Thus,  a change  from a bull ot unknown  
genetic  merit  (and therefore  assumed  to be  average  for the breed)  to an average  
approved  Al bull automatically  improves  performance  of the progeny  by about  
5%. A further  change  from the average  approved  Al bull to the best approved  
Al bull within  a breed  would  give about  a further  3% improvement  in perform ­
ance. Therefore,  within  a breed,  performance  can be improved  by 8-10%  by 
using  the best approved  Al bull compared  with a an average  bull of that breed.  
In suckled  weanling  production,  a bull with an EBV of -h30 kg for weaning  
weight  would  produce weanlings  15 kg heavier  than the average  bull.  This would 
be worth  about £700  annually  in a 50 cow suckler  herd or £3000  to £4000  more  
over the lifetime  of the bull.

RANKING  BULLS  ACROSS  BREEDS
Where  bulls have beef ratings  they can be ranked  for performance  across 
breeds.  This permits  the best or most  suitable  bull to be selected  for use almost  
irrespective  of breed.  The 1996 Approved  AI Beef Bull List (Department  of 
Agriculture.  Food and Forestry,  1996)  contains  127 bulls of which  71 are ap­
proved  for widespread  use. All these  have RBVs  for growth  rate, carcass  con­
formation  and carcass  leanness  and some  have  a feed efficiency  rating.  In addi­
tion they all have been surveyed  for ease of calving.

-i-Mean  values  for Angus  bulls approved  for widespread  use (1996)
Using  a combination  of the Beef  Progeny  Test Data  included  in the Approved  
AI Beef  Bull List, and the data from the Grange  Beef  Breed  Evaluation  Pro­
gramme,  an across-breed  beef value  (ABV)  was calculated  for all the AI bulls
224
approved  for widespread  use in 1996. This was done using the Angus  breed  
mean as the baseline  (i.e. Angus  breed mean = 100) for growth  rate, carcass  
conformation  and carcass  leanness  (Table  4). Feed  efficiency  was not included  
because  only a small number  of bulls have feed efficiency  ratings.  From this, 
together  with the published  within breed RBVs,  ABVs were calculated.  A 
sample  of the values  for the poorest  and best growth  rate bulls  of each breed  are 
shown  in Table  5 and the results  were expressed  as the expected  superiority/  
inferiority  (£ per head)  of the male  progeny  (ideally  it should  be the mean of the 
male and female  progeny)  of a bull. A sample  of these values  relative  to the 
breed  mean  for an Angus  calf are shown  in Table  6.

+Value  of females  calves  should  also be considered
While  recognising  the greater  suitability  of certain  breeds  to certain  produc ­
tion systems  no account  could be taken of this, and the bulls were compared  
directly  on the basis of growth  rate ABV. The range in ABV was as follows;  
Angus  108 to 116, Hereford  105 to 121, Limousin  104 to 123, Simmental  110 
to 127, Belgian  Blue 115 to 119 and Charolais  114 to 130. Of the total 71 bulls  
approved  for widespread  use in 1996, 19 had growth  ABVs  of 120 or greater  
(10 Charolais,  2 Hereford,  3 Limousin,  4 Simmental).  Thus,  about  one-quarter  
of the AI bulls approved  for widespread  use were more than 20% superior  in 
growth  rate to the mean  of the Angus  breed.
Compared  with the Angus  breed  mean, all bulls approved  for widespread  use 
increased  male  calf  value  for beef  production.  This increase  ranged  from  £23 to 
£49 for Angus,  £23 to £59 for Hereford,  £22 to £76 for Limousin,  £25 to £75
225
for Simmental,  £55 to £61 for Belgian  Blue,  and £45  to £87 for Charolais  sired 
calves.  Calves  from  the best  Angus  bull were  more  valuable  than those  from the 
poorest  bulls  of all other  breeds  except  the Belgian  Blue.  At the top of the scale 
the male  calves  from the best  Charolais  bull were about  £ 10 more  valuable than 
those  from the best Simmental  and Limousin  bulls which  were similar.  These  
in turn were £15-£20  more  valuable  than  the calves  from the best Hereford  and 
Belgian  Blue bulls which  in turn were  about  £10 more  valuable  than the calves  
from the best  Angus  bull. At the extremes  the calves  of the best bull (Charolais  
CF44) were worth  about  £65 per head more than those of the poorest  bull 
(Angus  CUO).
GENETIC  MERIT  OF SUCKLER  COWS
Suckler  cows should  be of moderate  size and should  produce  a calf of high 
weaning  weight  every  year. Due to hybrid  vigour,  crossbred  cows  are superior  
to purebreds  for suckling.  Compared  with purebreds,  crossbreds  have earlier  
puberty,  better  fertility,  shorter  calving  interval,  better  calf survival  and better  
calf growth  rate. In a large scale US experiment  (Cundiff,  Gregory  and Koch, 
1982),  crossbred  (Hereford  x Angus)  cows  were compared  with purebred  cows  
(Hereford  and Angus)  both rearing  calves  from the same  sires.  Weaning  weight  
was 23 kg (15%)  greater  per cow exposed  to breeding  for the crossbred  cows  
than for the purebreds.  There  were two components  to this superiority.  Two- 
thirds of it was due to an increase  in the calf crop weaned  reflecting  better  
overall  fertility  in the crossbred  cows.  The remainder  was an increase  in wean ­
ing weight,  reflecting  higher  milk production  by the crossbred  cows. This 
increased  production  from crossbreds  over purebreds  was due to heterosis  or 
hybrid  vigour.  Increasing  heterosis  in the calf  by using  a sire of a third  breed on 
crossbred  cows  further  increases  calf weaning  weight.  In the US study  referred  
to above,  the addition  of the heterosis  of the crossbred  calves  (8%)  to that of the 
crossbred  cows  (15%)  resulted  in a 36 kg increase  (23%)  in the weight  of calf 
weaned  per cow of which about two thirds was due to the crossbred  cows.  
Clearly,  therefore,  in suckled  beef  production  the cow should  be crossbred  and 
the bull should  be from a third breed.
Dairy  cross  cows
Certain  beef  x dairy  cows  are quite  suitable  as suckler  dams  because  they are 
crossbred  (heterosis),  are of moderate  size (low maintenance  costs),  and are 
good milkers  (good  calf growth  rates).  In terms  of these  criteria  the more  suit­
able beef X dairy suckler  cow types are Angus  x Friesian,  Hereford  x Friesian  
and Limousin  x Friesian.  Other continental  x Friesians  (e.g. Charolais  x 
Friesians)  are larger  and have higher  maintenance  requirements.  In the past,  the 
most  common  suckler  cow was the Hereford  x Friesian.  With  the decline  in the 
use of Hereford,  and the increase  in the use of continental  breeds  in dairy  herds, 
Hereford  x Friesian  cows are now less readily  available  and the closest  conti ­
nental  cross in size is the Limousin  x Friesian.  These  two breed  crosses  were 
compared  in an experiment  at Grange.

Mean  cow liveweight  throughout  the year was 16 kg (507 v. 523 kg) greater  
for the Limousin  cross  cows.  There  was very little difference  between  the two 
breed  types  in the performance  of their  female  progeny  (Table  7), but when  the 
males  were reared  as young  bulls where  they had the opportunity  to express  
their  full growth  potential,  the Limousin  cross  progeny  were 15 kg carcass weight  
heavier.  This was mainly due to a better  kill-out  for the progeny  of the Limousin  
cross  cows  rather  than to a better  growth  rate.  Carcass  fat score  was 0.3 (males)  
and 0.5 (females)  lower  for the Limousin  crosses  indicating  that they could  be 
taken  to a greater  weight  than the Hereford  crosses  without  becoming  overfat.  
In summary,  therefore,  substituting  a Limousin  x Friesian  for a Hereford  x 
Friesian  suckler  cow would  increase  mean  cow liveweight  by about  3%. How ­
ever, carcass  output  per cow would  also be increased  by about  3% at the same  
age and carcass  quality  would  be better.  The progeny  of the Limousin  cross  
cows  could  also be taken  to a heavier  weight,  thereby  further  increasing  carcass  
output  per cow.
Sources  of suckler  herd replacements
The breeds  of sire used on dairy cows are about  50% Friesians,  20% early  
maturing  beef breeds,  10% Limousin  and 20% other continental.  Thus, the 
number  of beef x dairy heifers  suitable  as suckler  herd replacements  (early  
maturing  plus Limousin  crosses)  is about 150,000  in total. Inevitably,  some  of 
these are slaughtered  as maiden  heifers  for beef so in practice  not more than 
about 100,000  suckler  herd replacements  can come  from the dairy herd annu ­
ally. Since  the suckler  herd requires  up to 200,000  replacements  annually,  at 
least half of these (100,000)  must come from within  the suckler  herd itself.  
Indeed, to minimise  disease  risks and simplify  management,  many farmers  
prefer  to replace  from within,  rather  than buying-in.  This raises  the question  of 
how replacement  heifers  with the desired  attributes  of heterosis,  milkiness,  and 
moderate  size can be produced  within  a suckler  herd where  the main objective  
must  be the production  of high quality  meat  animals.

++ Charolais  Drennan,  M.J. (personal  communication)
Where  an existing  crossbred  cow herd is being  mated to a terminal  sire of one 
of the large continental  breeds  (e.g. Charolais),  retention  of the heifer  progeny  
for breeding  will ultimately  result  over a few generations  in cows which  are 
almost  pure bred and which  are quite large. Such cows (upgraded  Charolais)  
were compared  with Hereford  x Friesian  cows in an experiment  at Grange  
(Table  8). Mean cow liveweight  was about 100 kg heavier  for the upgraded  
Charolais  but their milk yield  was only two-thirds  (7.9 vs. 12.2 kg/day)  that of 
the dairy  crosses.  Consequently,  their calf growth  rate was lower  (1.08 v. 1.17 
kg/day) during the suckling  period  and weaning  weight  was 20 kg lower.  
Although  not evident  in this experiment,  later  puberty  and lower  fertility  would  
also be expected  in the upgraded  Charolais  cows. While  the superior  genetic  
potential  of the upgraded  Charolais  progeny  would  manifest  itself  in a higher  
post weaning  growth  rate and superior  carcass  merit  at slaughter,  this may not 
be sufficient  to compensate  for the higher  maintenance  requirement  and poorer  
fertility  of the dams  and the poorer  pre-weaning  growth  rate of the calves.
Where  replacements  are kept from within  the herd, ideally  they should  have 
the desired  suckler  cow attributes  (heterosis,  milk, moderate  size). This could  
be achieved  by criss-crossing  two beef  breeds  one of which  is of moderate  size 
and one of which has reasonable  milking  ability.  Two such breeds  are the 
Limousin  (moderate  size)  and the Simmental  (milkiness).  Then,  any of the other  
large breeds  (Charolais,  Belgian  Blue, Blonde  d’Aquitaine)  can be used as a 
terminal  sire thus maximising heterosis  in the calf  and ensuring  good  calf  growth  
rates both before  and after weaning,  and good carcass  quality.
Where  the existing  herd is beef x Friesian,  replacements  could  be produced  
by using  a Limousin  AI bull on 40%-50%  of the cows.  In genotype,  the result ­
ant progeny  would  be 50% Limousin,  25% beef and 25% Friesian  (the 25% 
beef could  also be Limousin  giving  75% Limousin).  Such  animals  would  main ­
tain heterosis  for reproductive  traits and milking  ability  and would  still be of 
moderate  size. To produce  the next generation  of replacements,  these  would  be 
crossed  with a Simmental  AI bull giving heifers which would be  50% Simmental  
and 50% other.  These  in turn would  be crossed  with Limousin  and so the geno ­
type of the herd would  fluctuate  between  about  two-thirds  Simmental  plus one- 
third Limousin  and two-thirds  Limousin  plus one-third  Simmental.
Where  AI cannot  be used,  an effort  should  still be made  to maintain  heterosis  
m the suckler  cow herd. This could  be achieved  by rotational  use of a different
228
breed of bull every few years when the bull is replaced.  Unfortunately,  this 
involves  some compromises  in both cow and progeny  potential  but judicious  
selection  of the breed  mix should  ensure  good overall  herd performance  .
In summary,  using  replacements  from the dairy herd permits  the use of the 
best beef bulls on all the suckler  herd thereby  maximising  the value of the 
calves  or beef produced.  However,  the dairy herd can provide  only about  half 
of the replacements  required  by the suckler  herd,  so producers  must  provide  up 
to half of their  own replacements.  Suitable  replacements  can be produced  by a 
strategic  cross  breeding  programme  based  on the use of selected  AI sires from  
the appropriate  breeds  on 40-50%  of the herd. Alternatively,  where  AI cannot  
be used,  heterosis  can be maintained  by rotational  use of a different  breed  each  
time the bull is replaced.
CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS
1. The National  Cattle  Breeding  Authority  should  be established  and func­
tioning  as quickly  as possible.  On-farm  recording  followed  by performance  
and progeny  testing  of the commercially  important  beef breeds  should  be 
expanded  in a rigidly  integrated  breeding  programme.  Superior  bulls must  
be used to produce  the next generation  of breeding  stock  and inferior  bulls  
must not be used for breeding.
2. Because  of the small pedigree  herd size and the lack of genetic  linkages  
between  herds, it will not be possible  to produce  EBVs  for all pedigree  
bulls.  Nevertheless  provided  the level  of accuracy is reasonable,  EBVs  should  
be produced  for as many pedigree  bulls as possible.  This would  facilitate  
producers  who are not using  AI to identify  and purchase  genetically  supe ­
rior bulls. As is currently  the case in Britain,  EBVs would  increasingly  
determine  the price of pedigree  bulls which  in turn would  lead to breeding  
programmes  in pedigree  herds designed  to improve  EBVs.  Thus the gen­
eration  of EBVs  would itself  act as a catalyst  for increased  genetic  progress.
3. Every  effort  must  be made  to ensure  that the current  and future  cattle  iden­
tification  systems  are used  in such  a way as to contribute  to genetic progress.  
With accurate  and reliable  records,  at least a proportion  of commercial  
animals  could contribute  genetic  information.  A huge source  of potential  
genetic improvement  will be wasted  if the data from commercial  cattle  
cannot  be used.
4. The international  trade in semen  (and also in embryos  and breeding  stock)  
has contributed  enormously  to the genetic  improvement  of dairy  cattle,  par­
ticularly  in Ireland.  While  similar  progress  is not possible  in beef  (because  
of the multiplicity  of breeds,  absence  of genetic  linkages  between  countries  
etc.), nevertheless  the Irish beef industry  would  benefit  greatly  if it could  
avail of semen from the  genetically superior  animals  being identified through  
much larger and more sophisticated  breeding  programmes  abroad.  This 
would  require  the testing  of bulls in a number  of different  countries  using  
internationally  agreed  and uniform  evaluation  criteria.  From this conver ­
sion formula  could  be derived  which  would  allow  the conversion  ot breed ­
229
5.
6.ing values  from one country  to another.  This would  permit  objective  com­
parisons  of bull ratings  across  countries.
There  are large genetic  differences  both between  and within  breeds.  The 
between  breed differences  have been widely  recognised  and exploited  by 
producers  but the within  breed  differences  have not. This should  be the next  
area  of progress. Genetically superior  bulls  of all breeds  are available  through 
AI and it will be possible  to identify  genetically  superior  bulls for natural 
service  when EBVs  are produced.  Producers  must become  more aware  of 
the genetic  differences  between  animals  and ways must  be sought  of pass­
ing on the information  on genetic  merit from calf to weanling  to store to 
finishing  producer.  This would  facilitate  pricing  on the basis  of genetic merit. 
There  should  be a definite  replacement  policy  in suckler  herds. Replace ­
ments may come from outside  the herd as beef x dairy heifers  or as 
specially  bred beef  x beef  heifers.  Where  replacements  are produced  within  
the herd they should  have heterosis,  good milking  ability  and be of moder ­
ate size. This can be achieved  by criss-crossing  40%-50%  of the herd with 
selected  AI bulls  of appropriate  breeds. The remainder  of the herd  should  be 
bred to a terminal  sire breed  to maximise  beef output  and carcass  quality. 
Where  AI cannot  be used rotating  the breed of bull can go some way 
towards  ensuring  heterosis  and some other desirable  attributes  in the re­
placement  heifers.

Developments  in the Australian  Beef  
Industry
G. KROKER
Agriculture  Victoria,  Bendigo,  Australia
1. Introduction
The  Australian  red meat  industry  commenced  in January  1788,  when  the two  
Africander  bulls, six cows and 44 fat-tailed  sheep  imported  from the Cape of 
Good Hope by Governor  Phillip  arrived  in Sydney.  History  records  that five 
months  after the landing,  only one sheep was alive and all of the cattle had 
strayed  when  their convict  keeper  fell asleep!  Surprisingly  the lost cattle  were  
recovered  seven years later, when it was found  that they had multiplied  to a 
herd of 60.
From this very modest  beginning,  livestock  numbers  in Australia  have  
increased  to 26.2 million  cattle, including  2.8 million  dairy cattle, and 121 
million  sheep,  producing  beef  and sheep  meat  worth  almost  $5 billion  annually. 
(In August  1996,  an Australian  dollar  was equivalent  to 0.49 Irish punts).  Beef  
exports  alone are worth $2.85 billion  per year. Although  not the largest  pro­
ducer,  Australia  is now the largest  net exporter  of beef in the world and the 
second  largest  exporter  of sheep  meat.
Sheep  in Australia  are kept  primarily  for wool production,  and of the 730,000  
tonnes  of wool (greasy)  produced  annually,  65% is exported  for a return of 
some $4 billion.  Sheep  numbers  are currently  the lowest  for almost  50 years  
because  of the depressed  world  wool market.  The prime  lamb  industry  is virtu ­
ally a ‘by-product ’ of the wool  industry,  and is based  on first-cross  ewes  (Bor ­
der Leicester  x Merino)  mated  to a terminal  sire breed,  usually  Dorset  or Poll 
Dorset.  In 1995, lamb and mutton  production  in Australia  was valued  at $833 
million.

Australia  is a large country  with a land area similar  to that of north  America,  
but vast areas of the continent  are unproductive  due to inadequate  rainfall  or 
low soil fertility.  Livestock  are produced  in production  environments  ranging  
from the tropical  summer  rainfall  areas ot northern  Australia  to the temperate,  
winter  rainfall  zone of southern  Australia.  Livestock  producers  receive  no 
government  subsidies,  and must contend  with the effects  of climatic  and envi-
231
ronmental  extremes.  Various  forms  of government  assistance  in times  of drought, 
bushfire  and flood are rapidly  being  phased  out
With a population  of only 19 million  people,  Australia  is heavily  dependant  
on exports,  and livestock  producers  are also exposed  to the vagaries  of world 
markets.  The beef industry  is currently  suffering  a serious  downturn  due to 
depressed  prices  on the Japanese  market.  This has occurred  primarily  in re­
sponse  to massive  over-production  in the United  States,  resulting  in intense  
competition  with Australia  for market  share.  Problems  have been exacerbated  
by the strength  of the $A, high grain  prices  in Australia  and reduced  beef  con­
sumption  generally  associated  with the British  ‘mad cow disease ’ scare.
Almost  half  of the national cattle  herd,  but very few sheep,  are now run in the 
tropical  and subtropical  regions  of northern  Australia.  Over  the past 20 years.  
Bos indicus  breeds  of cattle have largely  replaced  British  breeds  in these re­
gions  because  of their  heat tolerance,  tick resistance  and capacity  to utilise  low 
quality  roughage.  The beef industry  in northern  Australia  is characterised  by 
large herds (1,000  breeding  cows is considered  necessary  for a viable  family  
operation)  extensively  managed  on very large properties  ^,000 to 100,000  ha 
or more,  depending  on location).  Historically  these  herds  have produced  large 
quantities  of low grade  manufacturing  beef  for the American  Hamburger  trade.  
Over  the past decade  however,  both herd productivity  and product  quality  has 
been increased  significantly  as the result  of improved  breeding  and manage ­
ment,  and improved  pastures.
With a temperate  climate  and more reliable  rainfall,  conditions  in southern  
Australia  are more favourable  for high quality  pasture  production,  and live­
stock are managed  more intensively  on smaller  properties  (around  500 ha). 
Beef  cattle  are usually  run as a sideline  to a sheep  or cropping  enterprise,  and 
the average  herd size is about 134 head. British  and European  beef  breeds  and 
their  crosses  predominate,  and are used  to produce  high quality  pasture  fed beef 
and as a source  of feeder  cattle for feedlots  throughout  Australia.  Perennial  
ryegrass  and white  clover  pastures  are grown  in the higher  rainfall  areas, but 
much  of southern  Australia  has been sown to phalaris,  cocksfoot  and subterra ­
nean clover.  Pasture  productivity  is currently  well below  potential.
As the production  environment  and nature  of the beef industry  in northern  
Australia  bears little resemblance  to that in southern  Australia,  and is far less 
relevant  to the situation  in Ireland,  most  of the technical  information  presented  
in this paper  relates  to the beef industry  in southern  Australia.
2. Structure  of the Australian  Beef  Industry  
Planning,  Policy  Setting  and Industry  Development
The Commonwealth  Government ’s Meat  and Livestock  Industry  Act (1995) 
established  the Australian  Meat  Industry  Council  (MIC)  to:
• develop  the vision  and strategic  direction  for the industry
• formulate  broad  industry  policy  (particularly  across  sectors)
• approve  strategic  plans for meat marketing,  promotion  and R&D
• set the funding  levels  for industry  activity
232
• evaluate  the performance  of industry
• develop  directions  for industry  self regulation
• resolve  issues  which  run across  industry  sectors
The MIC  board  is comprised  of 17 members  representing  all major  sectors  of 
the industry,  including  cattle  and sheep  producers,  feedlotters,  export  and do­
mestic  abattoir  operators,  retailers  (butchers and supermarkets),  the federal gov­
ernment  and the meat industry  employees  union.  A ‘Meat Industry  Strategic  
Plan ’ developed  by the MIC  earlier  this year  will be implemented mainly  through  
the activities  of the Australian  Meat and Livestock  Corporation  (AMLC)  and 
the Meat  Research  Corporation  (MRC), The AMLC  is responsible  for the mar­
keting  and promotion  of meat  both on the domestic  and export  markets,  and the 
MRC  establishes  priorities  and manages  the funding  of research  and develop ­
ment  (R&D).  The MRC  is currently  finalising  its Corporate  Plan comprised  of 
17 ‘Key programs ’ designed  to address  the issues  identified  in the Meat  Indus ­
try Strategic  Plan.
Figure  1: Agencies  Responsible  for Meat  Industry  Development.
Meat industry  R&D in Australia  is funded  by levies  on livestock  producers  
and meat processors,  matched  by an equal contribution  from the Common ­
wealth  Government.  Last year the MRC managed  a budget  of some $51 
million.
Over  the past decade,  a more systematic  and thorough  approach  to planning  
R&D  has been adopted  by the meat industry.  In 1986 the MRC implemented  
the first of a series  of ‘Five Year Plans ’ designed  to maximise  returns  to the 
industry  investment  in R&D.  Prior  to the completion  of the first plan, a com­
prehensive  ‘Research  and Development  Investment  Study ’ was conducted  as 
the basis for the second  ‘Five Year Plan’ , which commenced  in 1991. An 
on-going  industry  auditing  process  is now being considered  as a means  of 
benchmarking  progress  and identifying  industry  strengths,  weaknesses  and 
opportunities.
All levy payers  now have an opportunity  to contribute  to industry  planning  
and the identification  of R&D  priorities  through  the various  organisations  rep­
resented  on the MIC board,  and through  MRC  advisory  committees.  The MIC
233
and the MRC use a range  of techniques  to assess  opportunities  and industry  
R&D  needs.  Consultants  and market  analysts  are engaged  to conduct  interna ­
tional  benchmarking  studies  and to collect  and analyse  data from around  the 
world.  Staff are sent overseas  on ‘fact finding  missions ’ and to identify  new 
technology  which  may have application  in Australia.  Extensive  consultation  
with industry  occurs  at a variety  of levels,  from  the ‘Annual  General  Meeting ’ 
through  to workshops  and seminars  on specific  subjects  and invited  submis ­
sions.  All new R&D  project  proposals  are subjected  to a rigorous  benefit-cost  
analysis  and scrutiny  by industry  through  ‘Technology  Transfer  Advisory  
Groups ’, prior  to funding.
In the past, the MRC  has invited  research  organisations  to submit  R&D  pro­
posals  for their  consideration  on an annual  basis,  and a significant  proportion  of 
the total MRC  budget  has been allocated  to these  submitted  projects.  Although  
this practice  continues,  the emphasis  now is on commissioned  R&D that 
addresses  industry  priorities  identified  in the strategic  plan. This year for 
example,  only 2% of the budget  ($ 1 million)  will be available  for submitted  
projects.
Production  Sector
Most  beef  in Australia  is produced  from  cows kept exclusively  for beef  pro­
duction.  The majority  of the calves  born to the nation ’s 2.8 million  dairy  cows,  
that are surplus  to dairy  industry  requirements,  are slaughtered  for veal produc ­
tion at less than 2 weeks  of age. A very small ‘pink veal ’ production  system  in 
which  dairy/beef  calves  are artificially  reared  and lot fed for 20 weeks  before  
slaughter  and export  to Europe,  is struggling  to become  established  in the face 
of high production  costs.
Australia  has vast tracts  of land suitable  only for grazing,  and the  meat  indus ­
try has therefore  always  been pasture  based.  In southern  Australia,  the cost of 
pasture  dry matter  production  is in the vicinity  of $25/tonne,  whereas  in recent  
years,  the cost of fcedlot  rations  has varied  from $130 to $220/tonne  of dry 
matter.
Despite  this, Australia  has had a small feedlot  industry  since  the late 1960s,  
located  mainly  in northern  Australia.  In response  to the increased  demand  for 
grain-fed  beef since the liberalisation  of the Japanese  market  in 1988, the in­
dustry  has grown  rapidly  to the current  capacity  of 825,000  head. Last year,  
82% of cattle  in feedlots  were  fed for the Japanese  or other  export  markets,  but 
the demand  for grain-fed  beef on the domestic  market,  particularly  for use by 
the hotel restaurant  trade,  is also expected  to grow.
In formulating  feedlot  rations,  the aim is to maximise  feed intake and 
liveweight  gains,  and to minimise  health  problems  and digestive  upsets,  at the 
least possible  cost. Key ingredients  are:
• Roughage  or fibre, which  is required  to maintain  normal  rumen  function.  
This requirement  conflicts  with the need to maximise  the grain component  of 
the diet to achieve  high growth  potential,  but the risk of acidosis  and severe  
digestive  upsets  is greatly  increased  when the proportion  of roughage  in the 
diet is less than 20%.
234
• Energy,  which  determines  growth  rate. For rapid growth,  steers  under 12 
months  of age need a ration  containing  12 megajoules  (MJ) of metabolisable  
energy  (ME)  per kilogram  of dry matter,  and yearling  cattle  need 11 MJ/kg.
• Protein  is essential  for growth,  and to maintain  health  and appetite.  Young  
cattle  need  more protein  than older  cattle,  and feedlot  rations  contain  11 to 15% 
crude  protein,  depending  on the age and weight  of cattle  being  fed.
• Minerals  are required  to maintain  feed intake,  health  and feed conversion  
efficiency.  The ratio of calcium  to phosphorous  is particularly  important  for 
feedlot  cattle,  as grain contains  high levels  of phosphorous  but low levels  of 
calcium.  Extra  calcium  is therefore  included  by adding  agricultural  limestone  
to the ration  at the rate of 1%. Depending  on the amount  of protein  in the diet, 
extra  sulphur  may also be required,  and salt is normally  included  at the rate of 
0.5 to 1% to provide  sodium,  stimulate  appetites  and reduce  urinary  problems.
• Trace  minerals  are necessary  for enzyme  function,  protein  transport,  blood  
composition  and for the action  of rumen microbes  and vitamin  synthesis.  These  
are normally  provided  by using  commercially  available  ‘premix ’.
• Vitamins  are also essential  to maintain  the health  of feedlot  cattle,  which  
have a daily requirement  for the three fat soluble  vitamins  A, D and E. These  
are also provided  in a commercial  ‘premix’ .
Feedlot  rations  in northern  Australia  are based on sorghum,  barley,  maize  
(silage  and grain),  cottonseed  meal and lupins,  whereas  in southern  Australia,  
wheat,  barley,  triticale,  lupins  and peas are the main ingredients.  Rations  are 
commonly  comprised  of up to 80% processed  grain, 15 to 20% roughage  and a 
‘premix ’ of minerals,  vitamins  and ionophores  and buffers  to reduce  the risk of 
acidosis.  The feedlot  industry  currently  competes  with the milling  and brewing  
industries  for wheat  and barley  and there is considerable  interest  in the estab ­
lishment  of a stock feed industry  based  on new high yielding  varieties  of red 
wheat.
Because  of their superior  carcase  characteristics  and greater  propensity  to 
produce  marbled  meat, the feedlot  industry  has a clear preference  for British  
beef  breeds  (particularly  Angus  and Shorthorn)  and Murray  Greys  (a compos ­
ite breed  developed  in Australia  from Angus  and white  Shorthorns)  in meeting  
the stringent  quality  requirements  of the Japanese  grain fed beef market.  The 
potential  to increase  growth  rate and carcase  yield  by using  European  breeds  is 
now widely  recognised  however,  and European  by British  cross-bred  cattle  are 
commonly  fed for markets  where  marbling  is not required  (such  as the domes ­
tic and Korean  markets).
In southern  Australia,  beef  calves  are typically  weaned  at 8-1 1 months  of age 
and 240  to 300 kg liveweight.  Depending  mainly  on breed,  fatness  and seasonal  
and marketing  conditions,  these  calves  may then be;
• slaughtered  immediately  for the domestic  supermarket  trade
• transferred  to a feedlot  and fed for the domestic  market
• grown  out and finished  at heavier  weights on pasture  for either  domestic  or 
export  markets
235
• grown  out at pasture  to a heavier  feedlot  entry weight  (typically  450-500  
kg) prior  to feeding  for export  markets.
Approximately  60% of slaughter  cattle in southern  Australia  are still sold 
through  saleyards,  normally by liveweight  auction after  pre-sale  weighing.  Sale-  
yard throughputs  are declining  however,  in favour  of modern,  more objective  
direct  marketing  systems,  including  various  forms  of ‘over the hooks ’ selling.  
This trend is expected  to continue  as more  producers  recognise  the potential  to 
improve  their returns  by breeding  and managing  cattle to accurately  meet 
market  specifications,  and then using  marketing  systems  in which  price is de­
termined  by objective  assessment  of carcase  weight  and quality.
A similar  trend  is evident  in the marketing  of store  cattle  and feeder  steers.  At 
present,  over half  of these  cattle  are sold by auction  through  saleyards,  and the 
majority  are not weighed  but simply  sold  on a per head basis.  However,  changes  
to store cattle  marketing  are being driven  by feedlot  managers,  who are now 
well aware  of very large differences  in performance  between  lines of cattle  
from different  properties.  Feedlots  are now showing  a clear  preference  for pur­
chasing  cattle  direct  from farms,  and particularly  from producers  who are able 
to supply  reliable  information  about the genetic  potential  and health  of their 
cattle.
The declining  role of saleyards  in the marketing  of both slaughter  and store  
cattle  is also related  to the higher  cost of saleyard  selling,  the stress  associated  
with the  extra  transport  and handling  of stock  through  saleyards,  and the inabil ­
ity of saleyards  to provide  ‘feedback ’ to producers  on the true quality  of their  
cattle.
Farmers  throughout  Australia  face rising costs, record  levels of farm debt 
and declining  terms of trade. Last year and before  the current  downturn,  the 
Australian  Bureau  of Agricultural  Resource  Economics  reported  that over  the 3 
years to 1995, 71% of beef enterprises  in Australia  were not profitable.  Other  
studies  have demonstrated  enormous  differences  in profitability  between  beef 
herds  operating  in similar  production  environments  (-$29  to $296 per hectare  
in southern  Australia),  with larger  herds and improved  management  practices  
being associated  with greater  profitability.  There is evidence  to suggest  that 
herds of less than 2(X) cows are no longer  viable  in southern  Australia.  Large 
numbers  of producers  have left the industry  in recent  years,  and many  of those  
remaining  now rely  on off farm income  to survive.  Further  ‘rural adjustment ’ is 
inevitable.
In southern  Australia,  ‘livestock  equivalent ’ systems  are used to compare  the 
feed requirements  of different  classes  of stock,  and livestock  enterprises  in dif­
ferent  production  environments.  The ‘Dry Sheep  Equivalent ’ (DSE)  system  is 
widely  accepted,  where  a ‘dry sheep ’ is a non-pregnant  and nonlactating  two 
year old sheep weighing  45 kg and maintaining  its present  weight.  Thus for 
example,  a dry cow weighing  500 kg is rated at 7 DSE, while  the same cow 
lactating  and with a 3 month  old calf at foot is rated at 15 DSE. Average  beef 
cattle  production  costs  per DSE  in southern  Australia  are shown  in Table 2, and 
average  prices  received  for cattle  and gross  margins  are shown  in Table  3.
236
Processing  and Wholesale  Sector
There  are 111 export  abattoirs  in Australia,  and approximately  140 abattoirs  
producing  solely  for the domestic  market  (domestic  abattoirs).
The export  processing  sector  throughout  Australia  is regulated  by the Aus­
tralian  Quarantine  and Inspection  Service  (AQIS)7  which is responsible  for

monitoring  food safety and hygiene  standards.  AUS-MEAT,  the national  
authority  for the uniform  specification  of meat, carcases  and livestock,  sets 
standards  for and monitors  product  description  in export  (compulsory)  and do­
mestic  (voluntary)  abattoirs.  Abattoirs  slaughtering  beef cattle for export  are 
required  to meet different  standards,  depending  on the country  of destination,  
in terms of plant, equipment  and management  practices  in order to maintain  
their  export  registration.  Export  abattoirs  normally  operate  as exporters,  and as 
such, must obtain licences  and entitlements  from the AMLC  for export  to
237
different  overseas  markets.  Most export  abattoirs  also supply  meat to the do­
mestic  market.  Domestic  abattoirs  are regulated  by State  Meat  Authorities,  and 
may on a voluntary  basis become  accredited  under  AUS-MEAT.
All export  and some  domestic  abattoirs  incorporate  their  own boning  rooms. 
In recent  years, with the rapid expansion  of the hospitality  and food service  
industry  and the decline  in the number  of butcher  shops,  there  has been a move  
towards  centralised  boning.  The number  of independent  boning  rooms  has also 
increased.
International  benchmarking  studies  have demonstrated  that processing  costs  
in Australia  are considerably  higher,  and in some  cases,  almost  double  that of 
our major  competitors  (notably  the United  States  and New Zealand).  Australia  
has surplus  processing  capacity  with many  out-dated  and inefficient  plants  still 
in operation  and there is little doubt  that failure  to invest  in modern  plant and 
equipment  is a contributing  factor.  Similarly  the high cost of the on-line  inspec ­
tion service  contributes  to higher  processing  costs. The efficiency  of abattoir  
management  is often  questioned,  but high labour  costs  and poor  industrial  rela­
tions has long been a serious  issue. Most abattoirs,  under  pressure  from the 
Australian  meat workers  union,  still work under  a ‘tally ’ system,  which  effec ­
tively means  that they only operate  for a few hours each day. By contrast,  
abattoirs  in the United  States and New ziealand  are commonly  working  two 
shifts,  enabling  far more  effective  use of plant  and equipment.
Replacement  of the on-line  inspection  service  provided  by AQIS  with a sys­
tem of industry  self regulation  based  on ‘Hazard  Analysis  and Critical  Control  
Point ’ (HACCP)  and quality  assurance  principles  is seen as an important  mecha ­
nism for reducing  the cost of processing  meat in the future.
Australian  meat processors  have also recognised  the need to adopt brand 
name marketing,  and many  are now working  to establish  their own brands  on 
both domestic  and export  markets.  Product  brands  are a particularly  important  
component  of marketing  strategies  in Japan,  and individual  meat  company  brands 
are being  used in conjunction  with the already  well accepted  generic  ‘Aussie  
Beef ’ brand.
Retail  Sector
In the past, red meat in Australia  has been sold mainly  through  an extensive  
network  of butcher  shops,  but in recent  years,  the proportion  of meat  sold through 
supermarkets  has increased  to 37% nationally  (up to 70% in some States). Com ­
munity  pressure  for extended  trading  hours and the convenience  of ‘one stop 
shopping ’ at supermarkets  has forced  the closure  of many butcher  shops,  and 
this trend is expected  to continue.  The reluctance  of many  butchers  to adapt  to 
changing  consumer  requirements  has possibly  also contributed  to the demise  of 
some  butcher  shops.
As indicated  in Figure  2, the per capita  consumption  of red meat in Australia  
has also declined  over  the past decade,  in favour  of pork and chicken.  Concerns  
about  the relationship  between  saturated  fat intake  and heart  disease  have been
238
Figure  2: Per capita  consumption  of meat  in Australia  (kg)
1986
partly responsible,  and the industry  has attempted  to counter  this by actively  
promoting  the virtues  of lean red meat as a healthy  source  of highly  digestible  
protein  and iron. The increased  demand  for ‘convenience ’ foods  and variability  
in the eating  quality  of beef  are also likely  to be contributing  factors.
As in other  developed  countries,  the changing  lifestyle  in Australia  has also 
contributed  to the decline  in red meat consumption,  with important  implica ­
tions for meat retailers.  With almost  70% of Australian  women  now in the 
workforce,  and 58% of two parent  families  having  both parents  working,  there  
has been a growing  preference  for meals  involving little  or no preparation.  Money  
spent  on ‘dining  out or fast food ’ has increased  from 22% to 33% of total food  
expenditure  over  the past  decade.  Relative  to other  food industries,  the red meat  
industry  has been slow to adapt  to the increased  demand  for ‘oven ready ’ and 
takeaway  food.
3. Markets  for Australian  Beef
Last year, 64.2%  of total Australian  beef  and veal production  was exported,  
and the major  destinations  are indicated  in Figure  3. Exports  to the EU ac­
counted  for less than 1% of total production.
Each  market  requires  quite  different  types  of beef,  and for each market  desti ­
nation,  a range of specifications  are required  to meet the needs of different  
segments  of that market. Thus  the domestic  market,  for example,  has three  main 
sets of specifications  reflecting  the needs  of the local butcher  trade,  the super ­
markets  and the ‘hotel-restauranf  trade. Similarly,  the Japanese  market  has at 
least 8 sets of specifications  for grain and pasture  fed beef.
Market  specifications  are expressed  primarily  in terms  of carcase  weight  and 
fat depth  at the P8 (rump)  site, but for most  markets,  butt shape, fat  colour,  meat  
colour,  and dentition  specifications  must also be met. Specifications  for the 
very high quality  Japanese  grain fed beef market  also include  marbling  scores  
and minimum  periods  of feeding  a ration  comprised  of at least 70% grain.

tremely  heavy  muscling)  to E (very  poorly  muscled).
The Japanese  grain fed market  also specifies  a marbling  score of 2 to 3, on a scale of 0 (no 
marbling)  to 6 (very  heavy  marbling).
240
The United  States  and Canada  purchase  predominantly  low grade  manufac ­
turing  beef from Australia,  for which  the only specifications  are for a high 
percentage  (90% or more)  of chemical  lean. General  specifications  for other  
important  markets  are indicated  in Table  4.
Australia  also has a small,  but rapidly  growing,  live cattle  trade. Last year, 
510,000  head of cattle were exported,  mainly  to South East Asian feedlots.  
Australia  competes  with Ireland  for a share  of the Egyptian  live cattle  market;  
almost  20,000  head were shipped  to that market  from Australia  in 1995.
Asian  markets  for both  beef  and live cattle  are forecast  to continue  expansion  
to the year  2000,  but Australian  exports  are expected  to be restricted  by intense  
competition  from  tbe United  States  in particular.  Cuts to EU subsidies  and the 
‘foot and mouth  disease ’ status  of South  American  countries  are also likely  to 
impact  on the future  level of Australian  exports.
Specifications  for the various  beef  markets  are ultimately  determined  by the 
end user. Thus,  for example,  supermarkets  in Australia  engage  market  analysts  
to survey  customers  and to carefully  monitor  changes  in consumer  require ­
ments.  As a result,  carcase  weight  specifications  for supermarket  trade cattle  
have increased  from a maximum  of 180 kg to 240 kg, and fat depth  specifica ­
tions have been reduced  by at least 30% over the past 15 years.
4. Developments  Over  the Past Decade
The opening  up of the Japanese  beef market  in 1988 was the catalyst  tor 
significant  development  within  the Australian  beef  industry.  Until  that time,  the 
United  States  market  for predominantly  low grade  manufacturing  beef  was the 
principal  destination  for Australian  beef  exports.  By contrast,  the Japanese  and 
other  Asian  beef  markets  require  a very large  volume  of high quality  grain and 
pasture-fed  beef, and this has provided  the incentive  for industry  to improve  
product  quality  and competitiveness.  On-going  financial  pressure  to increase  
farm productivity  and community  concerns  about  food safety,  animal  welfare  
and protection  of the environment  have also stimulated  considerable  change.  
As a consequence  of these developments  over the past decade,  the Australian  
meat  industry  has commenced  the transition  from a commodity  based  industry  
to a customer  orientated,  sophisticated  and highly  competitive  food industry. 
Much  remains  to be achieved,  but a start has been made.
Feedlot  Industry
Investment  in the rapid  expansion  of the feedlot  industry  has probably  been 
the most tangible  consequence  of the liberalisation  of the Japanese  market.  
Between  1988 and 1994,  the industry  grew at a rate of approximately  15% per 
year, and current  Australian  feedlot  capacity  is 825,000  head in feedlots  rang ­
ing in size from  50 to 50,000  head.  With high grain  prices  and depressed  returns  
from beef in 1996, feedlot  utilisation  has fallen  to 56% of capacity.  There  has 
also been  a recent  shift in focus  from the Japanese  market  to the domestic  mar­
ket, where  grain feeding  is seen by some  processors  as a solution  to problems  
with continuity  of supply  of consistently  high quality  beef.

National  Product  Description  and  Trading  Language
The establishment  of AUS-MEAT  in 1987 is widely  regarded  as one of the 
most  important  initiatives  in the history  of the Australian  meat  industry.  AUS-  
MEAT,  the authority  for the uniform  specification  of meat and livestock,  was 
introduced  to develop  a national  language  for the description  of livestock,  car­
cases and meat, and to facilitate  improved  communication  up and down the 
entire  marketing  chain.  The two way flow of information  between  livestock  
producers  and agents,  processors,  wholesalers,  retailers  and consumers  is a 
central  theme.  Use of the AUS-MEAT  language  is compulsory  in export  but not 
domestic  abattoirs.  Although  it was seen as the imposition  of additional  costs  
and was resisted  by industry  at first,  it is now more widely  accepted  as being  a 
key element  in better  marketing.
Since  its inception,  the AUS-MEAT  language  has evolved  as new technology  
became  available.  In 1991 for example,  the new ‘chiller  assessment ’ system  
was introduced  for the assessment  of marbling,  meat colour,  fat colour,  the 
measurement  of eye muscle  area and rib fat depth  and the estimation  of lean 
meat yield. Evidence  for the value of measuring  pH as means  of identifying  
unacceptably  tougb  meat  is becoming  available,  and it is likely  that this too will 
become  part of the AUS-MEAT  language.  Similarly,  recent  research  in which 
video  imaging  technology  has been successfully  used for the rapid  assessment  
of carcase  quality  and yield could  result  in the further  refinement  of the AUS-  
MEAT  language.
The AUS-MEAT  language  is a description  system,  not a grading  system.  
Australia  does not have a grading  system  as such, although  the matter  is cur­
rently  the subject  of intense  debate  and two grading  systems  are under  develop ­
ment by different  industry  groups.  Until now, industry  policy has been to 
encourage  individual  meat companies  to use the AUS-MEAT  language  as the 
basis  for their  own product  brands.  However  the alternate  view,  that consumers  
need a simple,  uniform  grading  system  to assist them with purchasing  deci­
sions,  now seems  likely  to prevail.
Livestock  and  Meat  Marketing
Consumers  on both  domestic  and export  markets have become  more demand ­
ing in terms of meat quality  requirements,  and as a result, more stringent  
carcase  specifications  have  been imposed. A  major  problem  facing  the Austral ­
ian meat industry  however  is that there has been no effective  mechanism  for 
communicating  these specifications  to producers.  As a result,  the industry  has 
not been successful  in consistently  meeting  customer  expectations.  The AUS-  
MEAT  language  was introduced  to help resolve  this, but the fundamental  prob ­
lem has been the manner  in which  livestock  are traded.
Detailed  information  on the requirements  of different  markets  and livestock  
and meat  prices  both in Australia  and overseas  is readily  available  to producers  
and people  servicing  the meat industry  in a plethora  of AMLC  publications.  
However,  producers  respond  to clear ‘price signals ’, not marketing  publica ­
tions, and these signals  have not been a feature  of the dominant  marketing  
systems  used in the past.
242
The majority  of slaughter  cattle in southern  Australia  have been sold by 
liveweight  auction,  where  an average  price (cents/kg  liveweight)  is paid for 
each ‘lot’ or group  of animals.  Although  livestock  agents  draft animals  on the 
basis  of similar  weight  and body condition,  there  is no attempt  to identify  supe ­
rior animals  and price  them  accordingly.  Vendors  receive  no information  about  
their cattle other than the average  liveweight  and the average  price. Having  
received  no clear ‘price signals ’ from the market,  producers  are unable  to 
respond  by altering  their breeding  or management  systems.
To address  this problem,  the industry  is steadily  moving  to adopt various  
‘value based trading ’ systems.  Key elements  of these systems  are objective  
measurement  of carcase  weight,  quality  and sometimes  yield,  price related  to 
this objective  assessment  and the feedback  of information  to the producer.
‘Computer  Aided  Livestock  Marketing ’ (CALM)  was released  to the meat  
industry  in 1987 and incorporates  the principles  of value  based  trading.  In this 
system,  livestock  for sale are assessed  on farm by an accredited  CALM  
assessor,  who prepares  a detailed  description  of the livestock  and makes  this 
available  to potential  buyers  on the CALM  computer  network.  During  the des­
ignated  sale period  each week,  registered  CALM  buyers  throughout  Australia  
can then participate  in a computer  auction ’, using their own personal  
computers  to bid on the various  lots on the basis of the description  provided.  
Vendors  receive  feedback  on actual  carcase  quality  after  their  stock  are slaugh ­
tered.  CALM  now accounts  for around  15% of sheep  and 3% of cattle  sold in 
Australia.
Other  value  based  trading  systems  usually take  the form  of an ‘over  the hooks  
transaction,  with price determined  according  to a ‘quality  grid , such as the 
example  provided  in Figure  4. This grid provides  the premiums  and discounts  
in cents  per kg for Yearling (0 dentition)  male  or female  cattle.  The base  price  is 
represented  in the grid as a zero;  this is adjusted  weekly  and is readily  available  
from  the abattoir.  Conditions  of sale specifying  acceptable  breed types  and trad­
ing terms  accompany  the quality  grid.

In the southern  Australian  environment  where  approximately  75% of total 
annual  pasture  dry matter  production  occurs  in the 3 spring  months,  continuity  
of supply  of pasture-fed  beef  and lamb  has always  been a problem.  To encour ­
age out of season  production,  over the past 3 years processors  have offered 
forward  contracts  to producers  for the delivery  of both beef  and lamb to speci ­
fication,  during  months  of under  supply.  These  contracts  enable  producers  to 
‘lock in’ to a satisfactory  price some months  in advance  of delivery,  giving  
them the confidence  to incur  the additional  expense  of ‘out of season ’ feeding  
systems.  Forward  contracts  also provide  a means  through  which processors  can 
accurately  communicate  their  requirements  to producers.  Early  experience  with 
forward  contracts  has been extremely  positive.
As a further  means  of improving  the level of communication  and building  
trust between  the various  sectors  of the meat  industry,  the concept  of ‘strategic  
alliances ’ is now starting  to be taken up. The ‘Festival  Alliance ’ established  in 
southern  Australia  earlier  this year is an example.  In this alliance,  8 producer  
groups  are supplying  beef and lamb to specification  to 4 domestic  abattoirs,  
who are now supplying  branded  beef  and lamb  carcases  to the ‘Festival ’ chain  
of supermarkets,  comprised  of some 82 retail outlets.  Customers  are being  
offered  a ‘200%  guarantee ’ (product  exchanged  and money refunded  if they are 
not satisfied),  and they are being  actively  encouraged  to provide  feedback  on 
the product.  Retailers  provide  regular  feedback  to processors  on the extent  of 
compliance  with carcase  specifications.  Processors  purchase  livestock  over a 
quality  grid, and producers  receive  detailed  information  about  the quality  and 
price  of their  livestock.  Forward  contracts  with a choice  of 4 pricing  options  are 
being  offered  to producers.  In return  for their  commitment  to the alliance,  pro­
ducers  able to consistently  meet  specifications  have ‘preferred  supplier ’ status,  
and receive  preferential  treatment  when  livestock  are over supplied.
The ultimate  objective  is to develop  marketing  systems  in which price is 
directly  related  to saleable  meat yield and the eating  quality  of meat,  of which 
in Australia,  tenderness  is by far the most important  component.  Recent  re­
search  on the use of video  image  analysis  to predict  the carcase  yield has been 
extremely  promising,  but the accurate  prediction  of tenderness  remains  elusive.  
Extensive  research  on the development  of a ‘tender  tech ’ probe to measure  
tenderness  on the kill floor  has now been abandoned.
Consumer  Perceptions  of Meat  Quality
The meat industry  is confronted  with two major  challenges  in this area.
The first is that the type of uncooked  meat that consumers  select is quite  
different  to the type of meat they prefer  to eat. In response  to messages  from  
health  professionals  about  the potentially  harmful  effect  of saturated  fat intake, 
consumers  generally  prefer  to purchase  very lean cuts of meat with no visible  
marbling.  Numerous  studies  have shown  however  that these same consumers  
prefer  to eat meat from fatter animals,  and with at least moderate  levels of 
marbling.
The second  issue is that although  consumers  prefer  to eat beef over alterna ­
tive meat products,  they do not regard  it as being  reliable  in terms  of consist-
244
ency of eating  quality.  By contrast,  chicken  does have a reputation  for being  
reliable,  and is often selected  by consumers  who would  otherwise  prefer  to eat 
beef. Overcoming  the unacceptable  variation  in product  quality  for both 
domestic  and export  markets  will be the subject  of a considerable  research  
effort  in future  years.
Breeding  and Genetics
A recently  completed  study  of the performance  of steers  fed for the Japanese  
grain-fed  beef  market  has concluded  that a sustained  and co-ordinated  approach  
to improving  feeder  steer genetics  is needed  in Australia.  Almost  5000 steers  
produced  from 371 beef sires  of 6 breeds  and breed  crosses  were evaluated  in 
terms of feedlot  growth,  carcase  quality  and yield. Significant  breed differ ­
ences were found  in all traits, but breed alone was no guarantee  of perform ­
ance.  Within breeds,  the difference  in commercial  performance  between  the top 
and bottom  5% of individual  steers,  vendor  lines and sire progeny  groups  was
$270,  $130  and $120  respectively  when  fed for 200 days.
Breedplan,  a world  class genetic  evaluation  system  based  on ‘Best Linear  
Unbiased  Prediction ’ (BLUP)  technology,  was released  to the industry  in 1985  
and is now the main avenue  for the genetic  improvement  of beef  cattle  m Aus­
tralia  and New Zealand.  Since  its introduction,  Breedplan  has been expanded  to 
include  the ‘estimated  breeding  values ’ shown  in Table  5.
Table  5:

200-day  growth Gestation  length
400-day  weight Calving  ease
600-day  weight  14
After a relatively  slow start due mainly  to resistance  to change  within  the 
stud cattle  industry,  Breedplan  is now being  used and actively  promoted  by 13 
breed  societies.  Largely  as a result  of pressure  from commercial  beef  producers  
wanting  reliable  information  on sale bulls,  some 1,500 mainly  seedstock  pro­
ducing  herds  are now registered  with Breedplan.  A recent  evaluation  has found  
that herds  using  Breedplan  technology  are producing  calves  up to 10% heavier  
at the same  age than they were before  implementing  the genetic  improvement  
program,  giving  a benefit-cost  ratio of 15'. 1 .
The potential  to increase  productivity  through  the use ot crossbred  females  
(Figure  5) has been well known  for over 20 years,  but prejudice  against  cross ­
bred cattle and concern  about  the complexity  of crossbreeding  programs  has 
inhibited  the rate of adoption  of this technology.

In recent  years  there has been a steady  increase  in the adoption  of crossbreed ­
ing, as producers  have recognised  the need to increase  productivity  and adjust  
their  breeding  programs  to target  the requirements  of different  markets.  In 1^4,  
33% of beef cattle in Australia  were crossbred,  and of these, 58% were Bos 
indicus  x Bos taunts  cross  in northern  Australia.  Data  for southern  Australia  in 
1994 are summarised  in Figure  6.

Approximately  65% of commercial  beef producers  in southern Australia  are 
now practising  crossbreeding  with at least some  of their cattle.
Pasture  Productivity  . ... .Over  the past 20 years,  only 3-4%  of pastures  m southern  Australia  have been 
ungraded,  and as a result, many pastures  are dominated  by unproductive  
species  of low nutritional  value.  Research  has highlighted  the need to focus  on:
• the introduction  of improved  species  such as clovers  and perennial  grasses
• ensuring  a high and balanced  soil fertility  status  (particularly  soil phospho-
• ensurfng  that stocking  rates are high enough  to effectively  utilise  the extra
The relatively  high  cost of upgrading  pastures  (over  $ 150/ha)  combined  with 
the risk of failure  has been a major  barrier  to adoption,  and numerous  d^on-  
stration  trials  have  been established  in recent years to  help overcome  this. I hese 
trials have invariably  demonstrated  spectacular  improvements  m productivity,  
with stocking  rates and gross margins/ha  for upgraded  pastures  frequently  
double  those  for ‘typical  pasture ’. There  is little doubt  that tor the foreseeable  
future,  the largest  productivity  gains to be made in southern  Australian  beet 
herds  will come  through  upgrading  pastures.
247
Out  of Season  Feeding  Systems
The increased  demand  for high quality  pasture  fed beef for export  markets  
and the requirement  for branded  product  to be available  all year round has 
focused  industry  attention  on the related  issues  of continuity  of supply  and con­
sistency  of product  quality.  Forward  contracts  combined  with cost effective  
pasture  based ‘out of season ’ feeding  systems  are seen as the means  by which 
the southern  Australian  beef  industry  can increase  the supply  of suitable  cattle  
during  winter  and early spring.
Historically  hay and to a lesser  extent  grain  have been the main supplements  
fed to cattle  at pasture,  but research  conducted  over the past 2 years has high­
lighted  the potential  for increased  use of high quality  pasture  silage  (Table  7).

Food  Safety
Incidents  involving contamination  of meat with organochlorines  (dieldrin and 
DDT), chlorfluazuron  and veterinary  chemicals,  and isolated  but extremely  
serious  cases  involving  microbial  contamination  of meat around the world have 
focused  consumer  attention  on the issue of food safety.
Australia  has had a national  property  registration  and compulsory  tail tag­
ging system  in place  since  the early 1970 ’s when  the Brucellosis  and Tubercu ­
losis Eradication  Campaign  began.  Both brucellosis  and TB have since been
248
eradicated  from all but a few isolated  properties  in northern  Australia,  but the 
property  identification  and tail tagging  system  has been retained  to facilitate  
the traceback  to property  of origin  of carcases  found  to be contaminated  or 
affected  by disease.  This, combined  with abattoir  monitoring,  enables  the 
Australian  meat industry  to respond  to breaches  in food safety  issues  that may 
occur.
Cattle in Australia  commonly  change  ownership  and may be grazed  on a 
number  of properties  between  birth and slaughter,  and the lack of a national  
system  for the permanent  identification  of cattle is a significant  deficiency  in 
existing  traceback  procedures.  State and federal  governments  have agreed  to 
establish  a national  permanent  cattle identification  and tracking  system.  Last 
year consultants  were  engaged  to review  the cost and feasibility  of cattle  iden­
tification  systems  currently  available,  including  electronic  devices,  and to de­
velop  recommendations  in consultation  with government  and industry.  The con­
sultants  have since  recommended  a dual tagging  system  in which  cattle  would  
be permanently  identified  by the breeder  with  a whole  of life ‘birth tag’ and, in 
addition,  would  be identified  with a temporary  transaction  tag at the time of 
each sale or dispatch  for slaughter.  This system  is now being  field  tested  against  
an agreed  set of standards,  including  a retention  rate for permanent  identifica ­
tion of at least 99% over 3 years.  Four identification  methods  are being  tested,  
including  intra-rumen  radio  frequency  capsules,  metal  tags, small  plastic  radio  
frequency  ear tags and medium  sized  radio  frequency  plastic  tags.
At this stage only one market,  the EU, specifies  that beef must not be pro­
duced from animals  treated with hormonal  growth  promotants  (HGP ’s). 
Although  the EU is a very  small market  for Australia,  a declaration  system  for 
the identification  of HGP free cattle, using special  pink ear or tail tags, was 
introduced  in 1994.  Legislation  controlling  the sale and use of HGP ’s has also, 
been introduced.
In July this year, a voluntary  national  ‘vendor  declaration ’ system  was intro ­
duced,  enabling  producers  to declare  the chemical  residue  status  of their  cattle.  
Meat  processors  have strongly  endorsed  the system  by indicating  that they will 
not compete  for sale lots without  vendor  declarations,  and in the first few weeks  
of operation,  the compliance  rate at saleyards  has been in excess  of 90%.  Cattle  
without  declarations  have been discounted  by up to $100/head.
Animal  Welfare and  Environmental  Considerations
In addition  to food safety,  community  concern  about animal  welfare  and 
environmental  issues  has increased  dramatically  over the past decade,  and this 
is now reflected  strongly  in government  policy.
By comparison  with the intensive  livestock  industries  where  issues  such as 
battery  cages for laying  hens and the tethering  of sows have evoked  a strong  
reaction,  the cattle  and sheep  industries  have  generally  not been targeted  by the 
animal  welfare  lobby.  Both  state and federal  governments  have  produced  ‘Codes  
of Practice ’ for the welfare  of sheep  and cattle,  but the  only significant  issues  to 
emerge  have been drought  and feedlot  management.  It is no longer  acceptable  
to simply allow livestock  to die due to drought,  and producers  are now 
prosecuted  for failing  to either  provide  adequate  feed and water  for livestock  or 
having  them humanely  destroyed.  The welfare  issues in feedlots  are mud in 
winter,  provision  of shade in summer  and the identification  and care of sick 
animals.  In practice,  most ‘animal  welfare  cases ’ involving  sheep or cattle
249
occur  on small ‘hobby ’ farms where  absentee  owners  or people  without  ad­
equate  animal  husbandry  skills  are responsible  for the care of animals.
Land  degradation  due to soil erosion  and salinity,  and water  quality  are now 
serious  issues  in Australia,  and government  spending  on addressing  these  prob ­
lems and promoting  sustainable  agricultural  practices  has increased.  Rabbits  
have been responsible  for massive  environmental  damage  throughout  Australia,  
and it is hoped  that the recently  released  rabbit  calicivirus  will achieve  effective  
biological  control.  In northern  Australia,  overgrazing  by cattle  is a major  cause  
of soil erosion,  and in southern  Australia,  the planting  of deep rooted  perennial  
pasture  species  and agro-forestry  is being  promoted  to lower  the underground  
water  table  and help to prevent  soil salinity  problems.  Feedlots  are also a sensi ­
tive environmental  issue. State governments  strictly regulate  the location,  
design  and operation  of feedlots  to prevent  the contamination  of soil and both 
surface  and underground  water  with  feedlot  waste,  and to avoid  problems  with 
air pollution  (odour  and dust).
Quality  Assurance
The Australian  meat and livestock  industry  is now moving  to embrace  a cul­
ture of quality,  with all sectors  now either  developing  or actually  implementing  
quality  assurance  (QA)  programs.  Many are ‘Hazard  Analysis  and Critical  Con­
trol Point ’ (HACCP)  based  programs  certified  to the International  Standards  
Organisation  (ISO)  9002 standard.
From an overall  industry  perspective,  food safety is of paramount  impor ­
tance,  and QA is seen  as the foundation  on which to build  consumer  confidence  
in meat products.  Some  sectors  have also been motivated  by the need to meet  
community  expectations  in relation  to animal  welfare  and protection  of the 
environment,  and to reduce  the cost of government  regulation.
Under  criticism  from the community  in relation  to animal  welfare  and envi­
ronmental  issues,  the Australian  Lot Feeders  Association  (ALFA)  was one of 
the first organisations  to adopt the principles  of self regulation  through  QA, 
largely  to avoid the burden  of government  controls.  Tbe ALFA/AUS-MEAT  
national  ‘Feedlot  Accreditation  Scheme ’ commenced  operating  in August  1995,  
and already  763 feedlots  are accredited.  There  is a requirement  that all grain-  
fed beef  for export  must  be sourced  only from cattle  fed at accredited  feedlots.
Meat  processors  are also moving  to implement  QA. The potential  to reform  
the regulation  of export  abattoirs  is constrained  by the requirements  of our over­
seas customers,  but the domestic  processing  sector  has begun  to reduce  costs  
by replacing  traditional  on-line  inspection  with QA. In 1993 the Victorian  State  
government  established  the Meat Industry  Act which  provides  for the imple ­
mentation  and auditing  of QA programs  in domestic  abattoirs.  Already  two 
major  domestic  abattoirs  have achieved  ISO 9002  accreditation,  and others  are 
working  towards  this goal.
In 1995, the ‘Cattlecare ’ on-farm  QA program  for beef producers  was 
launched,  and ‘Flockcare ’ is currently  under  development  for sheep  meat pro­
ducers.  Cattlecare  currently  incorporates  15 key elements  addressing  the con­
tamination  of beef with chemical  residues,  carcase  bruising  and hide damage,  
but the program  will be developed  further  to include  other  aspects  of quality.  
Producer  organisations  are now moving  to provide  ISO 9002 certified  third 
party auditing  services  for participating  beef  producers.
The ‘Q Award ’, a HACCP  based and externally  audited  QA program  for 
retail butchers,  was launched  in May this year. The program  includes  advanced
250
product  handling  techniques,  a systematic  approach  to hygiene  and food safety  
and improved  methods  for product  display.
Other  sectors  of the industry,  including  livestock  transporters  and saleyard  
operators,  are also beginning  to develop  QA programs.
5. Future  Challenges  Facing  the Australian  Meat  Industry
By comparison  with their counterparts  in many other  countries,  Australian  
beef  and lamb  producers  operate  in an open  market,  without  government  subsi ­
dies. Their  products  must compete  not only on international  markets  with red 
meat  produced  in other  countries,  but also with alternative  sources  of food pro­
tein, particularly  pork and chicken  meat.  To remain  viable  in this environment,  
the industry  must  meet  consumer  expectations  in terms  of food safety,  quality  
and consistency,  and at a competitive  price.  Further  structural  change  will also 
occur,  with a move  to fewer  but larger  and more  efficient  livestock  enterprises
and processing  facilities.  , „ . j - •,The ‘Meat Industry  Strategic  Plan ’ released  by the Meat Industry  Council  
this year  recognises  that despite  past success,  the profitability  and competitive ­
ness of the meat  industry  are currently  not at acceptable  levels,  and that further  
change  is urgently  required.  Future  prosperity  depends  on the industry  ‘doing  
things  better  and differently’ , and the plan identifies  strategic  directions  and
actions  for achieving  this to the year 2001.
The overall  aim of the Meat  Industry  Strategic  Plan is to ‘increase  industry  
competitiveness  and profitability  in a sustainable  way , and to achieve  this, six 
strategic  imperatives  have been identified.  These  are;
II. Achieve ‘best in class’marketing
To achieve  food industry  ‘best in class ’ performance  from enterprise  and 
industry  marketing  and access  activities.
2. Guarantee  eating  quality
To guarantee  palatability  to domestic  consumers  of beef and lamb.
3. Guarantee  food  safety
To guarantee  food safety  through  a ‘plate to paddock ’ quality  assurance  
system.
4. More  consistent  supply  j. if a
To achieve  a consistent  (quality  and volume)  and predictable  supply  of prod ­
uct that meets  customer  specifications  at all stages of the production  and 
marketing  chain.
5. Facilitate  structural  change
To facilitate  rationalisation  and development  of alliances  that will achieve  
the optimal  industry  structure  for international  competitiveness.
6. Improve  leadership  and management
To achieve  leadership  in innovation  and cost efficiency  through  improved  
management,  training  and a culture  of partnership  within  enterprises  and be­
tween  industry  sectors.  • . ■ fRapid  and substantial  progress  in all six areas will be required  tor a signifi ­
cant impact  on profitability,  and the Meat  Research  Corporation  is now devel ­
oping  a comprehensive  R&D  plan  comprised  of 17 key programs  to address  all 
elements  of the Meat  Industry  Strategic  Plan.

Options  for Cattle  Farmers
A. PETTIT,  Teagasc,  Kildalton  Agricultural  College,  Co. Kilkenny.
T. EGAN,  Teagasc,  Moorepark,  Fermoy,  Co. Cork.
The current  beef crisis will force many producers  to examine  their cattle  
enterprises  and assess  their  options.  The major  challenge  facing  producers  is to:
• maintain  a viable  stable  income  as best they can
• avoid  significant  deterioration  in overall  farm finances
This paper  highlights  some  of the key issues  a producer  should  consider  and 
what  advice  Teagasc  might  give. The main points  addressed  are:
1. Lower  versus  higher  stocking  rate systems
2. Importance  of farm efficiency
3. Which  cattle  system?
4. Borrowing  capacity
5. Overall  viability
ASSUMPTIONS
• The producer  is already  operating  a relatively  intensive  system
• Adequate  housing  and facilities  are available
• Costs,  output  and performance  levels are generally  based  on the excellent  
level of efficiency  in the Teagasc Management  Data  for Farm  Planning  1996
• Premium  rates are at 1996 levels.  It is assumed  that the Deseasonalisation  
Premium  will be available  for the immediate  future.
1. LOWER  VERSUS  HIGHER  STOCKING  RATES
What  are the merits  of higher  stocking  versus  lower  stocking  rate systems?  
This decision  is primarily  dependent  on individual  farm circumstances.  In this 
paper  the relative  profitability  of lower  versus  higher  stocking  rate is compared  
for a 40 ha. farm. It is assumed  that the farmer  is already  operating  a high 
stocking  rate system  and adequate  buildings  and facilities  already  exist for 
either  option.
The lower  and higher  stocking  rate systems  are classified  as follows:
Lower  Stocking  Rate:
• Physical  stocking  rate approximately  1.66 LU per ha. (1.5 ac./LU) ,
• EU stocking  density  less than 1.4 LU per ha.
• Eligible  for maximum  REPS  payment
• Eligible  for basic EU (Suckler  cow and Special  Beef) Premiums  and 
Extensification  and Deseasonalisation  Premiums
Higher  Stocking  Rate:
• Physical  stocking  rate approximately  2.5 LU per ha. (1 acre/LU)
• EU stocking  density  2.0 LU/ha.  maximum
• Eligible  for basic EU Premiums  and Deseasonalisation  Premiums
• Not eligible  for Extensification  Premium  or REPS  payments
252
Two systems  of cattle  production  (Suckler  to Beef  and a non breeding  system  - 
Weanling  to Beef)  were  compared  using  these  criteria.  Full details  are given  in 
Appendix  1 and 2. A summary  table is presented  below.
Table  1.1:
Income  From  Lower  Versus  Higher Stocking  Rate  Systems
Steer  Beef  Price  £ per kg Carcase
System £1.80  (82p/lb) £2.10(95p/lb)
Suckler  to Beef Total Per ha Total Per ha
Lower  Stocking  Rate £12,990 £325 £16,130 £403
Higher  Stocking  Rate £12,120 £303 £17,320 £433
Weanling  to Beef  Lower  
Stocking  Rate £12,193 £305 £15,554 £389
Higher  Stocking  Rate £11.563 £289 £17,295 £432
The higher  stocking  rate systems  are dependent  on a high beef price  to 
maximise  income.  With the lower  stocking  rate systems  maximising  support  
payments  (Premiums  and REPS)  is crucial.
In a low beef  price  environment  the lower  stocking  rate systems  have  signifi ­
cant advantages  such as: ■ r. Greater  income  stability  (in the short  term at least)  if a higher  proportion  of
income  comes  from support  payments.
• Reducing  stock  numbers  may facilitate  a reduction  in borrowings.
• Reducing  winter  feed costs,  grazing  costs  and maximising  individual  animal
performance  at grass.  r •
• Lower  stocking  rate systems  are also more  environmentally  friendly.
Disadvantages  include;  . . . „ o i
• If implemented,  proposed  changes  in the Extensification  Premium  Stocking
density  levels  will adversely  affect  the lower  stocking  rate option.
• For larger  farms  the capping  of REPS  payment  at 40 ha dilutes  the overall  
REPS  income  benefit  per hectare.
• Participation  in REPS  involves  commitment  to a five year plan.
• Tax implications  of destocking  must  be considered.
• Longterm  implications  of very heavy  reliance  on support  payments.
Comment
Beef  prices  are likely  to remain  depressed  for the forseeable  future.  It is clear  
that even intensive  cattle  farmers  must  assess  the income  implications  of lower  
stocking  versus  higher  stocking  rate systems.  The merits  of either  option  will 
be unique  to each farm situation  and cattle system.  In practice  farmers  may 
meet  REPS  and Extensfication  Premium  requirements  with less change  in stock ­
ing levels  than shown  here, depending  on the ratio of overall  area owned  to 
adjusted  area farmed.
Note- Lower  stocking  rate levels  do not and should  not imply a general  
lowering  of efficiency  standards.  Key efficiency  factors  (e.g. cow productivity,
253
animal  performance,  cost  control)  still apply.  There  is an even greater  challenge  
to utilise  grassland  efficiently.
2. THE  IMPORTANCE  OF FARM  EFFICIENCY
Cattle  farmers  face an enormous  challenge  if beef  prices  remain  at their  current  
levels.  Production  costs  equal  or exceed  the current  beef  price  in some  systems.  
(See Table  2.1 )

Scope  for Efficiency  Improvements
The Teagasc BeefMlS  Report  on Suckler  Farms  indicates  that there  is further  
scope  to improve  even on farms  operating  at a good level of efficiency.  See 
Appendix  3 for detailed  breakdown.  A summary  of the main conclusions  is 
given  below.
• fixed  costs are generally  too high
• silage  quality  needs  considerable  improvement
• meal costs  per kg. liveweight  gain are too high  reflecting  a need  for increased  
emphasis  on silage  quality  and grassland  management
• calving  spread  is much  too wide
• Calving  interval  and calf mortality  also require  considerable  improvement  
on some  farms
The two major  components  of efficiency  are;
• level and quality  of output
• cost structure
Increased  Output
Stocking  rate, animal  performance  and cow productivity  determine  output.
• Intensification  beyond  the basic  EU stocking  density  limits  (2.0 LU per hec­
tare) is not advisable  if substantial  investment  in housing  and livestock  is 
required.
• There  is considerable  scope  to improve  animal  performance  (particularly  at 
grass)  on many  cattle  farms.  For intensive  integrated  systems  (calf to beef, 
weanling  to beef, suckler  to beef) a swing  to lighter  carcasses  could  reduce  
output  per animal.
• In breeding  herds  cow productivity  remains  a key efficiency  factor  (calving
254
rate, calving  interval,  compactness  of calving  and calf mortality).  A five per 
cent change  in calving  rate changes  output  per cow by £30 in a suckler  to 
beef  system.
Cost Structure
Fixed  Costs  uA reduction  in fixed  costs  is difficult  to achieve  m the short  term.  Machinery  
costs are the significant  component  of fixed costs. Teagasc  National  Farm  
Survey  data indicates  machinery  costs  of almost  £100  per ha for certain  catego ­
ries of cattle  farms.(See  table  2.2). Cattle  farmers  will have to critically  assess  
how much  machinery  investment  they can carry.

Factors  to be considered  in reducing  winter  feed costs include:
Silage:  Ensure  adequate  quantities  of good  quality  silage.  Maximise
area available  for first cuts. Utilise  animal  slurry for maxi ­
mum  benefit.  Soil test regularly.  Minimise  wastage.  Use cost 
effective  additives  when  required
Concentrates:  Use economic  levels  of concentrates.  If the beef  price  is £1.90
per kg carcase  and concentrate  price is 14p per kg (£140/t)  
then breakeven  response  rate is approx. 13:1 (kg 
concentrate:  kg carcase). Unless  concentrates  can be purchased  
significantly  cheaper,  the optimum  concentrate  feeding  level 
will be about  3-4.5kg on good silage.  The cost per tonne  of 
concentrates  is very important  and producers  must ensure  
good value.
Extending  Extending  the grazing  season  (earlier  spring  turnout  and
Grazing:  extended  autumn  grazing)  will reduce  winter  feed costs.

Grazing  Costs
The feed costs  per kg liveweight  gain are substantially  lower  for grazed  grass
relative  to indoor  feeding.  (See Table  2.5)

• Maximise  weight  gain at grass. This is the most important  efficiency  message  for cattle  
producers.

3. WHICH  CATTLE  SYSTEM
Switching  systems  can have major implications  on cashflow,  borrowing  
requirements,  tax liability,  housing  requirements  etc. Radical  changes  need to 
be carefully  scrutinised.  As a broad  guideline  the majority  of producers  should  
pursue  systems  that:
• Provide  a reasonable  income.
• Maximise  support  payments.
• Minimise  risk (see Table  3.1).
• Have  realistic  investment  (buildings  and livestock)  requirements.
• Meet  market  requirements  (carcase  weight,  carcase  quality.  Quality  
Assurance)

Suckler  Systems
Suckler  to beef  systems  comply  with most  of the above  requirements.  In the 
current  climate  suckler  to weanling  or store systems  are more vulnerable  to 
market  forces.  However  a high proportion  of suckler  systems  are located  within  
the Disadvantaged  Areas.  This  further  enhances  support  payments  and provides  
a buffer  against  market  forces. The majority  of cattle  producers  will continue  to 
need a suckler  herd to supply  some  or all of their raw material.
Long  Term  Trading  Systems
Integrated  systems  (calf  to beef  and weanling  to beef) are considerably  less 
risky than short term trading  systems.  They can also maximise  support  pay­
ments.  Autumn  to Autumn  store  to beef  systems  have  the advantage  that buying  
and selling  occurs  at the same time. This lowers  the risk factor.  Autumn  to 
Autumn  systems  are compatible  with existing  EU stocking  density  require ­
ments  for the Extensification  Premium.
Short  Term  Trading  Systems
Both winter  finishing  and summer  grazing  systems  involve  a high degree  ot 
price speculation.  This makes  them particularly  vulnerable  to sudden  market  
changes.  It is more  difficult  to maximise  premium  payments  in these systems.  
As the risk factor is considerably  higher  these systems  are more suited to 
specialised  producers  or particular  situations.
257
Optimum  Finishing  Age
Premium  considerations  can have a major  influence  on the choice  of finish ­
ing age in an integrated  system.  In a spring  calving  suckler  to beef  system  for 
example;
• Finishing  (steers)  at 24 months  of age maximises  10 and 22 month  Special  
Beef  Premium  payments  and the Deseasonalisation  Premium.
• Finishing  at 30 months  increases  the land requirement.  The Deseasonalisation  
Premium  is not available.  The margin hectare  does not increase. The 30 month  
system  is less compatible  with the trend  towards  lighter  carcasses.
• A trend  towards  lighter  carcasses  may encourage  early finishing  systems.  If 
finishing  earlier  than  24 months  of age, the 22 month  Special  Beef  Premium  
and possibly  the Slaughter  Premium  are not collected.  This represents  a loss 
of up to £150  in support  payments.  Bull beef  is most  suited  to early  finishing  
systems.  However,  the market  opportunities  for bull beef  appear  limited.
4 BORROWING  CAPACITY
The scope  for investment  or expansion  is limited.  The majority  of drystock  
farms  cannot  carry any significant  level of long term borrowings  (See Table 
4.1).

• Living  expenses  £12,000
• Allowance  made  for tax payments
• Producers  should  not borrow  up to maximum  levels
5. OVERALL  VIABILITY
Viability will be dependent  on many factors including;  farm size,  cattle  prices,  
overall  efficiency  level of borrowings  and family  income  requirements  (See 
Table  5.2). Farm size is a major  determinant  of overall  viability.  Data from the 
Teagasc  1994  National  Farm  Survey  representing  80 - 85,000 farms  with cattle  
(and without  milk)  indicate  that:
• 45% are less than 20 ha in size
• 18% are over 50 ha in size
• On 40% of cattle  farms  the holder  or spouse  had an off farm job. This per­
centage  was considerably  higher  within  certain  categories  of cattle  farming.

Many cattle farmers  must supplement  their farm income  with off farm  
income  to meet overall  income  requirements.  This applies  even at very high 
levels  of efficiency.  At moderate  levels  of efficiency  only the biggest  farms  can 
generate  a viable  income.
CONCLUSIONS
1. Stocking  Rate Levels
The major  decline  in beef  prices  favours  “lower  stocking  rate” systems  which 
maximise  EU support  payments.  Schemes  such as REPS  help stabilise  and 
provide  a guaranteed  income  for the immediate  future. Even  intensive  farm ­
ers must  consider  the “lower  stocking  rate” option  and its implications.
2. Efficiency
High  levels  of efficiency  remain  crucially  important  even  if lower  stocking  
rate systems  are adopted.
The scope to increase  output  on intensive  farms through  higher  stocking  
levels  is limited.  There is scope to improve  animal  performance  particu ­
larly at grass.  In breeding  herds  cow productivity  remains  a key efficiency  
factor.
Fixed  costs  must  be controlled.  Machinery  costs  account  for the major  share  
of overheads  costs.
In many  cattle  systems  winter  feed  costs can account  for over two thirds  of 
total variable  costs. Cattle  farmers  must adopt practices  which  minimise  
winter  feed costs.
259
The feed costs  per kg liveweight  gain are substantially  lower  at grass  rela­
tive to indoor  feeding.  Maximising  weight  gain at grass is a priority.
3. Cattle  Systems
Suckler  systems  and longer  term trading systems  maximise  EU support pay­
ments  and are  generally  more stable.  Short  term trading  systems  involve the 
most risk.
A trend  towards  lighter  carcases  will militate  against  long term  (over  2 years  
of age) production  systems.
4. Borrowing  Capacity
The scope  for investment  or expansion  is limited.  The majority  of drystock  
farms  cannot  carry any significant  level of long term borrowings.
5. Overall  Viability
Many  cattle  farmers  must supplement  their farm income  with off farm in­
come  to reach  a viable  income  level.

Reform  of the EU Beef  Regime  in the 
Wake  of the BSE Crisis
I. YATES,  T.D.
Minister  for Agriculture,  Food  and Forestry
The Association  has a long and proud  record  of achievement  in the promotion  
and practical  application  of up-to-date  research  in modern  farming  practices  
over the past fifty years.  I am very pleased  therefore  to be present  for the 50th 
Anniversary  Beef  Meeting  of the Association  at a time  when  our cattle  industry  
is facing  one of its greatest  challenges  in that period.
Your first meeting  fifty years ago would  I am sure have also dealt with a 
crisis situation.  According  to the 1946 Annual  Report  of the Minister  for 
Agriculture  the number  of cattle in this country  at 4.15 million  was down by 
90,000  on the previous  two years  due mainly  to the slaughter  of calves  in 1944/  
1945 for 'economic'  reasons.  The price paid at the time for Grade  A cattle to 
the UK was Up per lb. dressed  carcase  weight.  The I Ip I might  add was in 
old pennies.
Our accession  to the EEC in 1973 which brought  hopes of stability  and 
prosperity  for cattle  producers  got off to a bad start when prices,  particularly  
for young  cattle, collapsed  and input costs soared.  There were no premium  
payments  then or compensatory  packages  to assist  the most affected.  Certainly  
the beef sector  has had it ups and downs  since accession  and because  of our 
heavy dependence  on exports,  particularly  to non-European  markets, difficulties  
on the world  market  were magnified  on the Irish market.  For example,  the BSE 
crisis in 1990 combined  with the Gulf War led to a substantial  drop in 
consumption  in Europe  and the closure  of many  important  markets  to Irish  beef 
for a period.  This was reflected  in relatively  low prices  and heavy  sales of beef 
into intervention  in the years 1990 to 1992. However,  the years  following  CAP  
reform  heralded  a new era with a more  balanced  market  in the European  Union, 
the elimination  ot intervention  stocks,  higher  market  prices  and substantially  
increa.sed  premium  payments.  Unfortunately,  what might  be seen in tbe future  
as a golden  era for Irish beef  producers  came  to an abrupt  end last March  with 
the announcement  in the House  of Commons  of possible  link between  BSE 
and CJD. Since  then we have seen consumption  drop dramatically,  by as much 
as 50% in some  countries  in the immediate  aftermath  of the crisis,  and prices  
right across  Europe  have fallen by about 16%. It is true that there has been a 
slow general  recovery  in consumption  levels in most Member  States  but the 
recovery  has been painfully  slow in some Member  States  and we have to face 
the prospect  that consumption  will never  recover  fully to pre-BSE  levels.  I will 
have more to say about this later.
I think that the measures  put in place  by the Government  and the European  
Commission  have made  a substantial  contribution  towards  relieving  the worst  
elements  of this crisis.  The Government  strategy  was firstly  to ensure  continued
264
access  for Irish beef to Third Country  markets,  the restoration  of confidence  
in beef  as a quality  product  in the European  Union,  the introduction  of effective  
market  supports  and the  payment  of compensation  to processors  most  seriously
affected  by the crisis.  ^ i
Following  major  efforts by my Department,  An Bord  Bia and the Diplomatic  
Services,  most of our markets  which  were temporarily  closed  have reopened  
again.  However,  trade  has not yet resumed  to a number  of key markets  - notably  
Libya  and Iran, but we are hopeful  of making  the necessary  breakthrough  m 
the not too distant  future.  I visited  Libya  in the middle  of July and a Libyan  
Veterinary  delegation is expected  to visit  here shortly to  clear  the way for exports,  
particularly  of live cattle,  to resume. Iran is also an important  market  outlet  
for the autumn  and I also am hopeful  that this market  will come on stream
shortly. ... ^
As far as the European  market  is concerned  the promotional  activities  of An 
Bord  Bia were  designed  to underline  Ireland's  high  standard  of public  and animal 
health and to promote  maximum  guarantees  to producers.  Understandably,  
following  the BSE crisis  the European  consumer  began  to attach  considerable  
importance  to traceability  of beef and the new measures  which  I announced  
recently  relating  to identification  and tracing  of animals  at slaughter  plants  and 
export  plants are designed  to provide  greater  reassurance  to consumers  and 
customers  on the origin  of catile and beef slaughtered  and exported.
While  intervention  purchasing  cannot  be considered  as a complete  solution  
to the problems  posed by the BSE crisis, I am pleased  that the European  
Commission  responded  to my request  at the beginning  of the crisis to 
significantly  improve  the effectiveness  of the intervention  system  by 
implementing  the carcase  weight  limit at a significantly  higher  level than 
provided  under the normal  intervention  rules, by including  grade 04 in 
intervention  and by providing  for the facility  for forequarters  to be sold separately 
into intervention.  Since  April  a total of 27,000  tonnes  of beef  has been purchased  
into intervention  in Ireland  out of a total of 298,000  tonnes  in the whole  EU. 
We are seeking  more  flexible  and more  effective  intervention  arrangements  for 
the AutumnAVinter  period. I have  put a number  of proposals  to the Commission  
for further  improvements  to the intervention  system,  including  an increase  in 
the processor's  margin  on sales into intervention  and special  recognition  in the 
intervention  system  of the fact that there is still a substantial  number  of heavy  
animals  in Ireland.  The Commission  have recognised  our difficulties  with the 
weight  limit and have given  a concession  which  will allow  carcases  over this 
weight  to be also taken in. The weight  limits  and other intervention  rules for 
the last quarter  will be decided  later this month,  but 1 have sought  from  
Commission  Fischler  the maintenance,  at least, of the current  carcase  weight  
conditions  in order for intervention  to put a floor in the market  during  the 
upcoming  critical  disposal  period.  I also expect  some  progress  on the processor  s 
margin  at today's  meeting  of the Beef Management  Committee.
The weight  limit  will continue  to be an i.ssue  as long as we need intervention  
to get rid of our surpluses.  Clearly  the Commission  want to move as quickly  
as possible  to the 340kg  carcase  limit  which they  introduced as far back as 1993
265
and which  was  upheld  by the European  Court  of Justice.  The Commission  - and 
most other  Member  States  - see lower  weight  limits as a means  of reducing  
production  but they are also of the opinion  that lighter  carcases  meet the 
requirements  of the EU market.  In the absence  of intervention  for almost  three  
years,  average  carcase  weights  have continued  to rise across  all categories  in 
the EU. In the ten year  period  1986  -1995  average  carcase  weights for all cattle  
rose in the EU by 9% with steers  going  from 324kg  to 353kg  and bulls rising  
from 313k
