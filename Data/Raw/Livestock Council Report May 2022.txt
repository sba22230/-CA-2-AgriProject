Input Crises
IFA wrote to Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue seeking immediate direct financial support for Suckler and Beef farmers.IFA is seeking financial supports for suckler and beef farmers to offset the increased costs for feed, fertiliser and fuel on farms based of their levels of production.Guaranteed support for farmers investing in beef production for the remainder of the year and into 2023.All lands must be utilised to produce fodder including lifting restrictions on land under schemes such as traditional hay meadow and Low input grasslands.Following IFA demands the Minister announced a €55m silage support package providing farmers with a €100/ha payment for all silage cut up to a maximum of 10ha.The scheme announced has to have the maximum flexibility to help farmers deal with the input’s crisis.The cap of €1,000 will have to be re-visited to reflect the needs of those farms with higher stocking levels. The research undertaken by Teagasc, which underpinned the scheme, will have to be taken into accountThe Department of Agriculture must frame the scheme to ensure the full drawdown of funds. Payments must be proportionate to the area claimed.  The payments should reflect full hectares, and any part of a hectare, claimed. The Minister’s announcement is a first step, but more will be needed. The recent Teagasc report found the impact of increased input expenditure will exceed output growth for the year. The production costs on suckler and finishing farms are projected to increase by 24% and 30% respectively.
CAP
IFA met senior DAFM personnel on 25th April and again set out the demands of the suckler and beef sector in the new CAP.€300/cow must be provided in targeted support to suckler farmers from 2023 onwards.The Minister must provide a rearing and finishing scheme for cattle farmers that will return €100/animal to support farmers in meeting the higher environmental production requirementsThe Minister has committed that all cows applied on in the new CAP Suckler Scheme will be paid at €150/cow for the first 10 and €120/cow for the remainder, this will require an increase in the €52m annual funding provided.The Minister for Agriculture must confirm his funding intentions for the national suckler cow scheme to run alongside the CAP Pillar 2 Suckler cow scheme. The funding allocation to sucklers for 2023 is €28m below current support levels.Specific issues raised in the context of the proposed 2023 Suckler Carbon Efficiency Scheme include;The allocated budget must be ring fenced for the scheme and for suckler farmers for the 5 years. The reference period provided must include 2022 The reference number per farm must allow new entrants to the sector and existing farmers develop their enterprise while contributing to the objectives of the scheme to receive payment for all of their cowsSBLAS membership must not be a compulsory eligibility condition for the schemeThe targets in the scheme must be realistic and must not penalise smaller farms where the % requirement is disproportionate. The % target requirements for the Replacement Strategy must be based on the last full animal number.Compliance with the Replacement Strategy cannot be based on the status of the sires of calves born in 2023, this would require an action on farms in May and June 2022 when no scheme has been agreed or available for application.The genotyping measure should be based on genotyping calves at birth when tagging with a reasonable minimum target that allows for empty samples, mortalities and issues with testing.    
Climate Action
The joint Beef and Sheep Climate Group has not yet been convened by the Minister.
NAP
The proposed NAP is exposing lower stocked suckler and beef farmers to unnecessary additional costs of compliance in areas such as LESS and outwinteringThe reduced thresholds at which these measures become applicable impacts directly on low stocked suckler and beef farms who are not in a position to incur the additional costs associated with these unnecessary changes.
Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR)
IFA are making a detailed submission to DAFM for livestock farmers from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve. The impact of the stockpiling of beef in late 2020 in the UK on beef prices in early 2021 will be part of the submission which will also focus on providing income resilience for beef farmers into the future as the full impact of Brexit has yet to be determined if/when trade deals and access issues come into play.
BEAM
