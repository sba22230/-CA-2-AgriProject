Bord Bia Grass-fed standard and PGI
Since last the National Council Meeting, grass fed standard agreed with Bord BiaThe IFA made it very clear that there needs to be more consultation with farmers and much more clarity around many aspects of the proposal.IFA highlighted some key issues including ownership and guarantees that price premiums will be paid back to farmers.Since that meeting, Bord Bia have published their PGI Product Specification Document.Main issues with proposed application for PGI status for Irish Grass Fed beef:Ownership: Farmer ownership of the PGI is crucial.Animals: Does not include all grades and young bulls have been excluded despite commitments previously made by Bord Bia that all categories of animals would be included if they met the grass-fed criteria.Grass fed Criteria: The criteria state that in order to be deemed grass fed beef the animal must spend a minimum of 220days per year grazing. It also states that hay and silage are accepted as a grass-based diet. This begs the question: why the need for the minimum number of days grazing? This will be of particular importance for farmers in parts of the country that regularly have to deal with ongoing poor weather conditions.Farm to Abattoir: The use of registered and approved hauliers only adds cost at farm level. There should be no issue with farmers transporting their own animals to the abattoir. In addition, Bord Bia have suggested that animals must go to a factory less than two hours away from the farm. This restricts a farmer’s ability to get the best possible price available, placing more power in the hands of the factories.Colour: Bord Bia have added an extra layer of inspections, in the abattoir, assessing if the beef will meet a new colour criteria. The colour criteria call for ’cherry red colour’ and a ‘creaminess’ of fat, yet another hurdle for farmers in their attempt to get a fair price.No return to farmer: Bord Bia confirmed to the Farming Independent that it does not have any research that shows European consumers will pay a premium for Irish grass-fed beef.Finally, there are a variety of other technical aspects of the proposal that need clarification. As the proposal currently stands, it only adds another hoop for farmers to jump through, with no guaranteed returns.
