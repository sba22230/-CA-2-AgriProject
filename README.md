### Questions

+ Can python read PDF for sentiment anaylysis?
  + the answer to this is that yes Python has various packages that can extract text from pdf files, but none are particularly good or easy to use.
+ Are free range pigs more profitable than indoor pigs?
+ How does silage quality affect animal prices?
+ Further to the above how does the price of animal feeds affect the price of animals? but how do I incorporate sentiment analysis in to this question.
